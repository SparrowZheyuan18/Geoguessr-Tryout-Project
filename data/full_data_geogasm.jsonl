are you supposed to find this place without being as crazy as I am and go through the whole United States [Music] welcome to geoghasm today we're going to play Geo detective I personally like to take some time and look around and gather the clues and think about it and then guess something rather than very fast paced games so this might be just something for me and possibly for you you can play along by clicking on this link down in the description the way I recommend this to be played is that you play one round when you have clicked on the location do not click guess yet but go back to my video and watch that particular round to the end and only then just click on the guest that keeps the maximum tension because then you don't know what the location is when you're watching my video then go back to your game and do the same for the next round but if that sounds complicated or annoying to you you can also just play through the whole thing and then watch my video or you can just watch my video if that's the only thing you want you do you right this map is ended for non-moving games difficulty is mixed so some locations are meant to be hard we are going to have no time limit moving is not allowed and off we go [Music] okay so this the sun is right there in the East so that's not very helpful yield drive on the right College Road US1 so we are in the United States United States yes indeed we are in the United States for some reason there is a person riding a bike in the United States hmm that's very surprising this looks very Southern with the palm trees and everything there are no front plates in some of the cars that tells something to someone for sure us one that is probably something that we could find there must be a road number one somewhere it could very well be in California I think the numbering starts from here if I'm not mistaken there's 101 that's a famous road but where is us one but we got one here um but that's a local Road I can't quite see what these things are unfortunately but if this is the one we're talking about where is there a college I'm thinking this would make more sense right US1 would be San Francisco perhaps the 101 is going West and East and College Road is to the north this doesn't seem right a well-named Corona Road here wonder if they would want to change the name get education tribe that's pretty close to a college Road isn't it there is a college library here but no College Road it seems so close though so close Okay so I couldn't find it south of San Francisco so I guess I'll go back to San Francisco and look up north from there getting kind of tired with this one I could not find it so I wonder what should I do at this point okay so a new tactic I didn't find anything and I spent way too much time on that then I thought maybe this is not the right number one maybe there are more number ones and then I thought I'll go to Washington because I thought maybe row number one starts from Washington I don't know well I did find row number one and it's uh Highway one U.S Highway one so I was like all right Yes actually it's this one in the east coast so I decided to follow it all the way through New York and Boston and so on and I I spent quite a lot of time quite a lot of time but because I'm I'm completely sure this is the road and I will just find it I will find it I went down all the way to the southernmost point of Road one I just checked where it is and Key West the number one Highway goes all the way here to the southernmost point of the Continental USA and then I decided that let's start from this end and see if we can actually get to something like a college Road oh so I'm not very much looking forward to this but but anyway here is mile marker zero that's what I found zero mile art this is a thing apparently in the United States [Applause] foreign [Music] holy [ __ ] College Road going north and then turning to the left oh it doesn't it looks like it turns more to the left but makes sense there's some building there there is a bridge here that tracks and most importantly there is water on the south side that explains these boats here oh for [ __ ] sake so all this time it was in the very beginning of row number one I guess that makes sense if you think about how you're supposed to find this place without being as crazy as I am and go through the whole United States the College of the Florida Keys never heard of it so it's not like very important we're actually on the road a little bit so here yes yes oh I'm sure you know it's not better detectives or whatever could have found this quicker but I literally had to Brute Force this ugh and I'm tired from that you either need intelligence or you have to be hard working so hard working oh well I hope you didn't have to do something like this I'm crazy you don't have to be let's continue [Music] okay um what is this flag Ah that's a good question um got some Arabic stuff going on here we are on some kind of a fortress West North East this flag so looks like it has some Arabic colors to it but at least right now I don't recognize it hmm the sun is quite high up but in the South I would say uh saluba has them cookie plus Nora okay I don't approve of this put it somewhere where it's not as historical as this so what is that flag could it be hmm you can see the city there in the South and it has minarets so this is not Morocco what is the current flag of uh Libya um all cheers hmm could there be something like this here or is that the Egyptian flag what about Alexandria alburgefort [Music] where is the actual Port it doesn't look very 40. and if it were this one there wouldn't be any land there it's Adele 15th century Fortress and Naval Museum outer side is round and faces pretty much South north we could be here if we were here the Citadel side would be visible I think straight to the West not really but Southwest you could see City maybe maybe that's I don't think so and also this ramping this doesn't quite match up with that one but the the compass could be wrong but what I'm thinking here is that according to this picture we should definitely be like here and it doesn't quite fit but this is certainly the best best I've got if I don't find anything else [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] just checking the the coastline for cities and castles not gonna do this forever but I'm not completely satisfied with the castle that I found [Music] there is a minaret just a little bit South West from here quite far so we should be kind of looking at like like somewhere here there is a mosque really far there large architecturally notable mosque that could be this one uh I don't think this is right but I'm going to guess this one laughs wow um wow I just I I still don't believe that this is this is correct but I take it uh it was the only one that that fit so it was the Egyptian flag and uh I am very happy with this one good job good job me thank you me oh these are really tough but I like it that way so let's just uh go ahead and continue [Music] Mount Rushmore okay back in the U.S and now we are close to Mount Rushmore right there in the north and there is also a Crazy Horse there so I guess we'll just look for Mount Rushmore and Crazy Horse um as it happens I do not know where Mount Rushmore is so I hope it wasn't doesn't take forever for me to to find it now the question is really is is it a palakian or Rocky Mountains [Music] so I saw here that um this is uh us16 here so I thought it would be easier for me to find 16 than Mount Rushmore but I only can find 515 and 17 obviously [Music] okay I finally found 16 so if I follow that then maybe there it is crazy horse so it's not Rocky Mountains or apple Akin apparently there it is Mount Rushmore so where are we in in Custer maybe so if we were here we are North 5th Street uh but where's the 16 then here is 60 so we would be actually right here oh I didn't even notice that Jesus I didn't notice there was so much information here uh 16 West uh 385 South 16. 6385 so we are right here in this corner Custer come to candy right here so we found it and yeah we're right here somewhere yeah nice that wasn't so hard now I know where Mount Rushmore is that's nice Center of U.S in South Dakota okay very good hope you got that one too let's go [Music] so we are on the border I guess to Argentina yes Chile Argentina this shouldn't be too hard sus quests [Music] I can't find either of those immediately there's something like a 50 the road is number 50 something I think [Music] we have 50 here [Music] there is success half the way from Burma Markham there is a squash department but this is a bit tricky there are two roads that cross this is very annoying it looks like 52 to be so then it would be here across the border the road turns left immediately that bits and here it goes straight so we have to be on this Crossing that makes sense we are on the Chilean side let's say here I don't know here who knows they look very similar but this one turns and the other one doesn't so I think we're here yep that's right according to this flag we are outside of the road but that's obviously not true that wasn't too hard much simpler than the previous ones just look for the crossing of Chile and Argentina look for the city okay final round [Music] so Adidas we are in Adidas country Nigerian airspace management okay of bakan Airport terminal is there a place called bakan somewhere well I I can't find it and it should be a big place since it has an international or or an airport at least Oyo State uh that you should have noticed here Oyo state that could be badan also or something like this so I'm not completely sure if I if I read that correctly foreign [Applause] should be easier to find than this one [Music] oh I don't find it airport why don't I find it ah but that is oh stupid I didn't see that either and that explains it so where is your Airport but on there probably yes ipadan airport the airport itself is it is it there the field is probably the West [Music] to the east yeah I mean I've been doing this way too long now the baggings and Pet Shop nice good one Nigerian airspace management is that that can't be the terminal it's too small where's the terminal ah this is a bit tricky I definitely don't see a handbag shop here but that person does have a handbag so that makes sense [Music] here is Nigerian airspace management aha we are closer here okay got it not here but here there's this road coming in yeah that angle looks a lot better and then the road goes here that's good enough for me 13 meters yep so I got them all after plenty of effort I have to say that was not easy the first one was a grueling Brute Force tactic of going through row number one until I found the right corner that is crazy don't do that don't do as I do do as I say that worked out but it was a little bit insane I admit so let me know in the comments how you did I hope it was as good for you as it was for me I like to see you next time as well so maybe do that subscribe push that like button thanks for coming

damn it oh [Music] it feels good look at this face look at this face we are somewhere here like this [Music] all right geogasters welcome back today I have another attempt at a full score in the classic world map and it is a Play Along video so you will find the link below click on that and you can play this exact same map for free you don't have to have a geocacher subscription to play Oh I recommend that you do it is to have two tabs open one with the game and one with this video and every time you finish a round before the time Runs Out you switch to the tab and watch me play that round and then you can switch back to your tab so you will keep the maximum tension going on if that sounds too complicated for you you can just play through the whole thing and then watch my video or you can just watch the video however you want we have 10 minute rounds with moving and everything the aim is to get the Perfect Score so that's why you have a lot of time so let's go okay so the sun is in the North uh this looks otherwise fairly difficult uh I would say New Zealand based on them the nature and the mountains I could imagine some Hobbits going around here on their quest to destroy the wandering uh we seem to be driving on the left that fits it as well do we have English language yes we do I'm thinking we are in New Zealand and this sign says Carlton Ashley Road and Ashley Jordan George Gorge so let's look at here New Zealand we only have mountains in the southern part I think if we could have something like Ashley see if the mountains are everywhere not really sober the South and the East are mountain free West and north at mountains so that fits very well with most of this this area uh Ashley [Music] we have Ashton and ash Burton so could we also have Ash Lee Maybe do you think [Music] so that was a bust I do not find Ashley here there is also Carlton or something and German something German road but these are just roads there's no number on this road I think maybe somewhere further down [Music] foreign [Music] that is a German Road an Oxford and Ashley Gorge Oxford uh Oxford is here so we are in the right area aren't we [Music] Ashley Gorge Road at five kilometers we should be quite see towards South Southwest [Music] so we have to be somewhere five kilometers [Music] so where's the we are in Ashley Gorge Road German Road right that was the name of the other one there Sherman Road so when we started from here we went West and we got to Crossroads Ashley Gorge and we were on [Music] so we were we were on this one and we came to this one where we're going to West so we should have then when we go to the other direction we should have uh Thompson or no there is this one [Music] about the double or triple the distance so I'm thinking we are somewhere here like this [Music] 5 000 yes yeah wow very happy with that one that wasn't easy that wasn't easy at all um wow so all of that basically just by Nature first we were in southern hemisphere the nature told me this is New Zealand I believed it quite strongly because of the mountains and how how large it was and it really really did look like they could be taking the Hobbits to Isengard if you know what I mean so that's always always a good sign if you look like you could be in The Lord of the Rings you might as well be in the southern island of New Zealand it's interesting that looking at this ash thing we had ashburton and Ashton I think without these Ash things I don't know where I would have gone but I decided to kind of stay here I immediately saw Oxford from this distance you can't even see Oxford so it would take a long time to look for it but I got kind of Lucky with that that I was already in the right area so I could find Oxford and the rest of it was just looking for the actual right place starvation Hill there have been some hard times here wow what a start what a start let's go for the next round um so the sun is in the South we seem to be thriving on the right so I'm thinking we're somewhere in the United States and that does not make me very happy this and on the other hand helps me quite a lot north Texas because U.S is quite big but North Texas might not be that big I wonder if it has a name for the place uh yes it does actually have mevir City or something like this mevir city what is where is the end of Texas here [Music] [Applause] [Music] I should say that if if this is not enough Zoom to show you on the map then you are not a city let's keep that in mind though nimir or something like this I want to get a street number Road number [Music] it's quite a big city though so I wonder if this is actually just part of Dallas [Music] I still can't see anything let's go towards the center nonetheless [Music] [Applause] [Music] don't you have any signs like pointing to some place you know playing a road to the east this looks like we were quite in the center about here I just don't have names [Music] these have names [Music] foreign [Music] charge Bush Highway okay let's take a look at that what highway is it just give me a number what is that what is this [ __ ] give me a number give me a [ __ ] number now 75 finally [Applause] [Music] 75 right there planner Road going Northwest [Music] I'm not gonna get this one I don't get it where is the George W here President George W [Music] Renner Road okay [Music] we don't have enough time to do this you don't have time to do this um somewhere here here maybe [Applause] [Music] oh oh [Music] for [ __ ] sake two points God damn it oh what the [ __ ] scramble what a scramble oh gosh this is just round two I'm already so spent oh what a scramble that was tough that was tough as [ __ ] like when [ __ ] is tough sometimes it's very loose and and soft and well you know yeah well what can I say you saw me struggle you I I tried to find it and it was amazing how difficult it was to find the the number of any road I mean you could find the name of the road but I mean look at this city um it's pretty difficult to find this Plano Road and Runner Road and things like this not impossible but difficult and then I found the 75 but I still took a long time to find this President charge charge W bush partly because I thought it was 75. um I was right about the city all along so that's something the city that I had in the beginning didn't seem to make any sense whatsoever I can't see it anywhere uh there goes the the Perfect Score but I'll still keep on going we'll try to beat the record I had to go back to the beginning and think which way did I go to end up in this this highway that's why I clicked here because I thought it was a place where the road ended somehow so there was some method to this I clicked here it was so close so close next round okay driving oh whoops that happened there driving on the right let's just uh try to look for some info here it looks like Russia or something oh there we have it um we have a Cyrillic I realized I have been calling it kerylic all this time it's very red for some reason this could maybe no it's not not clear enough to say which which country this is but it's not Ukraine this also has quite a lot of red there that's interesting so Cyrillic is obviously spoken in various or written in various places um but this does look like Russia specifically got some yellow plates I'm not sure if I've seen that in in Russia very industrial and [Music] this is a Russian flag so let's say we are in Russia sorry Russians but this is look so depressing I don't know but what's Agro is there's a lot of industrialization going on here for sure so it's very flat I'm I'm currently thinking this would be summer in Western Russia rather than Eastern Russia foreign [Music] let's go back to the beginning then sign this way then it's like a power plant somewhere that's what it is but I don't know all the power plants of Russia by heart [Music] I'm thinking something like area or whatever but I mean this doesn't really this doesn't really make much of a difference let's rather go yeah let's stay there yeah completely wrong I mean Green Planet my ass Green Planet that's exactly how it looked like yeah Russia is sometimes difficult but it's usually not this difficult I just couldn't find any information no signs pointing to anything I mean what could I have done I don't know yeah that was just an old-fashioned full on with for your sake I either I hope you knew where this was or you went close to Moscow because you didn't know where it was 331 points is like you could just as well not play at all I suppose next round driving on the right um seem to be back in the U.S Hot Springs bus maple tree place we could be in Canada obviously green plates um some of you who know American plates better will know where this is I only know that there are areas I think in somewhere here that have a yellow plates um speed limit 25 that is definitely miles [Music] um so we are in the U.S [Music] well there's a sign that might help Vermont yep that's right it was here up in the north number two is that 2A we have two here that's very helpful what's 2A then but this is not this too this is a local 2 I think what does that mean then there's Berlin there that's great okay so Vermont um green plates uh we have Burlington and we have uh airport Burlington I think is a fairly big place I've seen it before I think Burlington there and we have airport we have South Burlington and Airport three kilometers a miles I suppose where's the airport [Music] where are you there's Burlington International Airport South Burlington three kilometers 2A was the road there's two I don't know where two a is I don't know what these three kilometers if airport thing is two kilometers then uh we should be summer like here or something like this maybe the distance [Music] um maybe this is to a that's seven but it's also two um there it is um due towards the West we are going towards the West on two and just to 89 is here to uh the South West we'd be all the way up here yeah there we are all the way up here because 2a's here spanked puppy restaurant and Pop I like that okay let's make um checkpoint here and return to start we got the maple tree place and the maple tree uh Road to get to where we were we went I think Northwest so probably here somewhere there is today here as well let's follow that [Music] this is correct I saw this Xfinity store this is right here yep okay we were way more down here this is U.S Highway 2E and this is a Maple Tree Place got that nice maple tree place right here uh we were going to to South Zephyr Road is what we were on [Music] um [Music] here okay yeah that makes sense going Southwest that's okay I was still a little bit uh turned around in all of this there's a union bank and I suppose Dunkin Donuts or something like this Union Bank here goes in here it comes out pretty much there in the middle of it the end of the Union Bank building that's it yes [Music] please zero beaters zero meters wow that's only the second time the second time ever I've got zero meters nailed that Dunkin Donuts nailed it right in its uh in its hole like Graham drive through the hole like the zero points like through the to the dunking like the donut ran right through the hole and had a geo-gasm you know what I'm talking about [ __ ] yeah yeah kids rhyming through holes and geographing yeah donuts and and chill gets her and getting right there nailing that that donut Pole you know what's up don't you you know that just feels good look at this face look at this face that's the face of a man who just came that close actually so close that you could just say this is the face of a man that just came really with zero meters is not even close it's right there he didn't come close he just came that's my point I hope you got that point I hope that has been made very very clear what my point is my point is that I was Zero meters off the right place in this game and got 5 000 points what did you think my point was let's go to the next round the final round uh did we finally get something less uh let's say Europe slash America centered here is really interesting cut you get the really nice car like that um so I'm thinking we're somewhere in Africa for sure um battery running up but we can do this we can do this um that's interesting um zemba Varma Block B okum we're driving on the left we have South African uh flag and we might be in a place called which is a very German name there is a place called bakum in German as well I think but where is Pokemon in South America is the question [Music] South Africa is the question [Music] just as a side note here in uh in Middleburg but you have some llamas here uh you can see the previous episode here I'll I'll link it somewhere here there was a sign about llama so go and check that out and I I don't mean go and check it out in this game I I mean travel there take a plane and and fly to Middleburg and go see the llamas I recommend it highly you might ask what's so interesting about the llamas and go there and see for yourself there are no ordinary llamas so I can't see Pokemon and I spent enough time looking there it is welcome look at that [Music] Magistrate Court all right that can't be very difficult to find right Magistrate Court San bavarna um that's confusing is that the same place is the same as a spoken so how do we know this is the same place there is soldado there's nothing on this place um we got yeah is this the place it's it's it's this is Pokemon is the same as San Bernard apparently um the Magistrate Office spoken and probably it has changed its name to a more local uh version of it but in order to be sure let's go and take a look if we can find Department of Agriculture or whatever that was right here next to it Department of Agriculture so I think um I think I've cracked it we are right here in front of the matches red Court very close to this intersection like this here that's where we are let's go for another zero if we can so there we go seven meters oh I did I thought I clicked on the road but oh I guess I didn't because I have to you have to really zoom in with the really zoom in so yes there we go 105 000 that's four five thousands and one a little bit different as we all know Russia is a little bit different let's enjoy all our points and the Fantastic little town of bochum or san babarna or whatever it was uh it certainly sounds more South American there's a lot of German places here Pokemon Westphalia and all these things okay time for a summary that is basically 20 000 points plus whatever I could scrap off of the surface of this desolate the depressive place called Russia let me know in the comments how you did please find the like button and try to click as close as possible to that button if you do uh dislike this then what I recommend is to go and find the dislike button and click on it two times very good idea just kidding I hope to see you in the next video thanks for coming foreign [Music] ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -43.259098052978516, "lng": 172.25869750976562}, {"round": 2, "lat":

"[Music] foreign ERS today I'm gonna make good on a little promise I made earlier and I'm going to give you a Play Along video on the dump test the dump test indeed dumb test for smart people I recently had a versus video between me and Geo wizard on this one but this is just going to be between me and you so this is a map where you have 36 famous locations and 36 look-alikes and you might get either the famous one or a look-alike and you're supposed to find on the map at first which one it is and where it is let's make round time for 10 minutes and uh no moving and I'll make it a challenge so there is the invite link I'm gonna copy it and it will be down below and you can play along for free you don't need the Geo guesser subscription to play this the way I suggest you do this is that you have two tabs open one you click open with the link you start the game and one is my video you and for every round you make a guess and before the time Runs Out you switch to the top of my video and you watch my guess on that ground and then after I have guessed and you have seen the result then you can go back to your game and do the same for the next round so you don't spoil the surprise and um if that sounds too complicated for you you can just play through all of it and then come back to watch the video that's perfectly fine as well let's go so I have unfortunately had this one well okay uh because last time I Got 5 000 points on this one as well so it doesn't really matter this is uh very easy so I'm just gonna run through this one that is the type by Taipei 101 this is the original and we are in this corner it will only take a little bit of time here to take a look that okay this is the street with that the towers to the Northwest so here's the tower Northwest here is a park here's a car park you can look at there's the car park I had this last time I played this I only played this once but since I got full points back then as well with ease because I know where this is I don't think it necessitates uh starting a new one one meter easy when you know where it is next round okay um this is also quite easy this is the Sydney Opera house now the question is always is this the original or not and uh let's see where is the opera house again uh [Music] Sydney Opera House is here um so is this the original for sure yes I mean this is how it looks like and uh that I what can I say nobody's gonna build a full replica of this including the surroundings and everything opera house is right there to the Northwest so if we're here it's right there I can't quite assess right now what is the precise distance here [Music] anyway this is gonna be good enough the road goes here and then turns like this and that's where we are let's guess uh five thousand points very nice that was easy as long as you know where the opera house is I mean I think most people know that it's in Sydney because it's known as the Sydney Opera house but not necessarily where exactly I hope you found it too this has definitely been easier than the one I played with Geo wizard next round okay so this is also easy the way the reason why this is easy is because these are the original ones and very famous uh that is in Rio Janeiro ristoradentor is right here we even have the actual form of of the dude my man South East so we're looking from this corner to know that Southwest how are we looking towards it from to the well I mean to the east south east that's really weird east Southeast so obviously the the compass has to be wrong because you can't look at it from towards the east and see its face so either it's you know Jesus my man so in any case we are on Jesus's right side and we are here um there is around thing here I'm guessing orista actually is [Music] is Jesus wrong way around here I wonder he's looking into the city right he's definitely looking in the city anyway uh we can't be too far off I would say right here that's gonna be good enough for me and yeah is is this a replica uh could this be a replica I haven't actually seen the statue myself the reason why it probably isn't the replica I would say is that this is a huge City in the valley that looks that this could be real the Genero people here look like they could be Brazilians [Music] [Laughter] wow okay you really got me there it really got me there something was off with the statue for sure but the rest of it fit is he looking the wrong direction healed up Jesus yeah there was something was not fitting with the surroundings there and the statue that's true but but everything else fit except except I'm a I didn't look if there's a c wow wow but that was fun they totally got me they totally got me did they get you as well did they get you Jesus Christ if you stop and think about it a little bit none of it really fits because yeah he's looking into the city I I looked like this but then we realized there's water where's the water but then on the other hand if it's not in Rio de Janeiro where is it where you fooled by this and if you weren't did you get any closer to it interesting wow okay I have to be more careful this is really tricky this is really tricky I like it okay uh this is uh Italy this is um probably some famous place in in Rome uh I unlike half of the world have never been to Rome so [Music] is there a Trevi I have uh some feeling that I I know what this is but I'm not sure [Music] this is a very tight Square so it's not the Neptune here [Music] can't really find it and I'm not sure this is Rome [Music] this is not the fake in the sense that this is a Italian police car with the right Stripes everything here seems legit this is some kind of a plaza of something maybe maybe this is Trevi I don't know makes sense but I can't find this particular place [Music] for some reason nobody wants to go near this guy there is a actually both of these guys they are looking at each other what's going on there actually this these guys are like standing here in the middle staring at each other with their similar clothes and nobody wants to go near them that's kind of weird let me know in the comments if you know something about these touristic things in in Italy it's quite possible that this is not in Rome I guess I could check real briefly Venice [Music] yeah whatever um I'm thinking this oh there's Trevi actually this is Trevi so that would make some sense I suppose to go somewhere here um okay found it that was uh that was a pretty tight time wise it was indeed review ah there you go eight beaches now that they got me with the with the crystal Redentor uh statue now there's always this little moment of here when you click on the button that it's gonna be like 7 000 kilometers off okay final round okay well this is also the real Colosseum so there's not much much here uh the Colosseum is the the north North East so we're probably somewhere here uh the road is going to the East and then turning there so it's uh probably somewhere here that's probably it and then there is a pedestrian crossing here we are almost on it so something like this uh why do I think this is the real one uh so this is uh Italian car plates to uh blue stripes here Italian car plates and um yeah it looks like it um some of this is obviously like later uh build or or repaired or whatever but there is enough of enough of old stuff to be sure that this is definitely the real one so no question about this this is easy and I have received a new batch four meters off to be honest this time three out of five rounds were a bit too easy maybe but then that was really offset by that Christ statue I thought that was brilliant that's brilliant that somebody makes that and it was just big enough and just similar enough on top of a hill to at least fool me and I'm interested to hear if it fooled you if I'm the only idiot here basically full points on everything except this one so uh fun times let me know how you did and uh if you like this

"[Music] hi fellow geogasters I'm back with another me versus Geo Wizard play along challenge because it's your wizard is back with another play along challenge this time a perfect detective map who is a awesome classic play along Geographic I know I am um pick me pick me this map that I've just discovered it's like the geodetected map but apparently it's perfect this map is meant to be played in no moving mode all the 667 locations have Clues monuments Flags writings or Geographic elements with a little skill and effort a 25k score is always possible but some rounds are harder than others meta knowledge is not required and the compass is never wrong that's important last time I was screwed by the compass so I like that um yeah so I'm going to take on this challenge you can also take on this challenge the rules for this challenge are the same as in the last challenge you can take a look at the previous video to see the instructions how to do this I'm not going to repeat them every time so let's just head right into it there is no time limit and there is no move let's play okay so we are in Europe we have EU plates we have a Dutch text here but we have a Belgian uh web address address and this points to Flanders okay Royal North Sea Yacht Club OST Ender so I'm thinking we are in uh Northern Belgium uh where they speak Dutch this is oh there is OST and so we're probably here and um we have Royal North Sea Yacht Club where is that Royal North Sea Yacht Club that seems pretty easy then this is straight to the east we have the beach turning right here so we are right here looking at the yacht club here in basically in the south east so we are probably right here at the end of this road and there is a pier that starts moving uh to that direction I'm going to go right here let's see what Mr Geo wizard has to say about this now already here without even panic are we seeing a sort of pink cue to these registration plates putting us in Belgium I'm actually used to seeing much more red here but maybe there's something wrong with my eyes but he definitely sees that they are pink maybe I am becoming color blind and can't see that they're pink but interesting because I basically knew that they are Belgian but I still couldn't quite see the mass Belgium so there's something wrong with my eyes I think oh there we go there's the be welcome five loot so this could be like who stand I'll have to look on the map actually I can't remember Avon Master usted yeah this one isn't too hard I mean I'm wondering whether this map is easier than the usual one but we can definitely get this instead yeah so we should be around here no we thought we're up by the beach so we're further up okay let's go in uh yeah I'm happy with that cool five yards amazing easy peasy zero meters yay I was even better not that it matters but you know it feels good zero meters not so easy to get next one foreign this looks very famous but I do not know what it is we have uh Swedish here plastic surgery in Swedish and English more Swedish the speed is Volvo so that's also very Swedish and Swedish Swedish Swedish now turning torso gallery now I'm guessing um this is supposed to tell me where in Sweden we are it does not tell me where we are I know we are in Sweden but how do I find out where this is considerably more difficult because it doesn't seem to have the name of the city here my first guess is that this is uh yet the bar I think yet the body has um maybe this kind of building um could also be malamur but I'm not sure I don't think this is a Stockholm actually I'm thinking maybe I should check malmir first turning torso there it is Iconic twisted and sculptured Tower block so I did remember where this was after all there is the the parking um aha then uh turning torso Gallery is actually the name of of the building yes and we have the the park here North West we are right here in this in this corner yep I'm satisfied with this I think this is uh uh the correct Corner since um the roads line up and the compass is not wrong so this is Northwest so this is correct let's see what uh Geo wizard things of this so ah straight away I think I'm nowhere that building is I think it's in Malmo the Turning torso it's called that's very helpful if you recognize the the tower then that's an easy PC oh that's definitely the right building that I was thinking of anyway so we're in Malmo June and this shouldn't be too hard for me to find it should be able to see the writing um the the label for it so he might see a pink color better than I do but he totally just panned over this this building it was in the almost in the middle of his map so at least I see better with my glasses but I need to check my color site I decided ah there is it is an NC turning towards so so we should be there um but yeah that is us four yards this time easy peasy um I can already see that this uh flag is in the wrong place so no zero meters this time because uh I can totally say that we are in the middle of the street and sometimes these things are wrong because if I saw correctly the flag was outside of the street yes this is definitely wrong but I was still better when it's 5 000 points then all the meters count foreign this looks really nice I like it what a beautiful picture um this could be a flag of Kazakhstan um so let's head right into Astana and there should be a building like this then if that is the flag of Kazakhstan uh there is a big road going um let's see that has to have some sort of a special name that's probably the parliament or something the road is going south uh and North oh [Music] okay um so I took a while um because as it happens uh um they specifically said that the compass is never wrong but look at this um so this is the flag of Kazakhstan I'm absolutely certain of this that was the beginning of this so this is Kazakhstan and we are in Astana what was my guess uh then I started looking around and I uh I saw that the river is going here to the south on the south side and west side so I looked at this and I was looking for stuff here because the river would be on the south and the west side it's only after I looked at the Sun and I realized that the sun is in the North the sun is in the north that means that we would be in the southern hemisphere deep in the southern hemisphere so I got really confused about this until I realized that this simply cannot be the compass has to be wrong it has to be in fact as backwards again the compass is exactly wrong it is Kazakhstan flag and also there are other tips here as well there is acrylic there is no place in southern hemisphere that has kerylic after I realized that the sun is in the absolute wrong direction I realize that we are exactly on the opposite side of the river so I finally found uh my place here so we have um lovers Park here big Park uh on the side of it there is a round building like this these were the easiest ones to find then you have something here called the circle the road goes through the circle so you see it here we are on that road right here it's going up and right next to us is uh this building here uh called I guess the Triumph of Astana or something like this so we are right here there is a football field here and some buildings here so these lines up perfectly if I look down I can see that we are pretty much on top of or in the in the corner of this road that is coming from uh from this building right here and it lines up with the fourth building on the other side there are four buildings here so it lines up with this one we are in the middle of of this one my guess is is this one it was a bit more difficult maybe than the previous ones but knowing Kazakhstan flag uh this wasn't too hard it's just the fact that that the compass was actually wrong uh after they promised that it isn't so it took me a while but I will edit that out so you don't have to worry about it I'm just telling you I probably looked around for about 10 minutes so thank you for that whoever made this map I would like to have my 10 minutes back if you could send it to me in on a private message or something like this that would be really nice thank you very much let's see what Mr Geo guesser has to say about this oh my goodness we're up on a building this reminds me of the other map I used to play bird's eye bird's eye view this could be harder this look at the colors of these houses insane buildings that one over there I've got an idea but it's nothing more than an absolute punch in McDonald's down there at first I thought they look and they do look quite Norwegian um or Icelandic or even sort of somewhat Slovakian no Eastern European but I don't think it's eastern Europe just look at these and I think look how spread out they are is that something you would find in Eastern Europe looking at this from an architectural point of view very typical of these former Soviet Asian countries is that they build very bombastic uh capitals like golden buildings there and and so on they might not be very representative of the architecture of the country generally I don't know much about Kazakhstan but I doubt that it looks like this all over the place that might be the reason why there's all sorts of fields about the architecture here and there is the giveaway guys there's a bloody flag it's um it's found it well what is the capital these days is it Astana I think it is Astana but they changed the name to uh I did I think they changed the name to something like not so Sultan but oh there it is actually Nur Sultan yeah Nur Sultan is the is the name of the of the capital nowadays I think we've got water over there to the east doesn't and now he's running the same problem as I did the compass is wrong yeah who knows how long he's spending time here also uh looking in all the wrong places it's the idea that your compass is wrong there's the McDonald's there's the McDonald's well so I would say that uh let's try it two yards oh that's so good you're all three okay so let's take a look two yards that's pretty impressive 400 meter I'm even closer wow this is this is tight now we're fighting over singular meters wow amazing amazing stuff okay so we are in Chinatown we are not in China we are in Chinatown okay um this is damn I'll have to think about this flag again um I'm not sure about this flag it's interesting because it does say San Francisco but this this flag then I hope this is San Francisco it's not very hilly Sacramento San Francisco uh color me confused here but we are in the in the U.S in San Francisco I guess this means that the buses go to Sacramento from here okay that's good so I don't have to know what this flag is I oh I think it's Taiwan isn't it yeah maybe that's Taiwan okay so we are in San Francisco in Chinatown in San Francisco do we have a street name here uh specifically I think we we saw something well there is this one here for instance Louis plays Saint sorry not Louis Place Saint Louis Place could we find Saint Louis Place um it's actually Sacramento Street so could this be Sacramento Street bus stop yeah there's the Sacramento Street uh somewhere and that is going that's on the South Side from us so we are on one of these these streets [Music] oh very Stockton it's right here yeah there's the tunnel yeah I should have checked the tunnel as well but that's fine the second building on the left and one two pretty much in the middle of the third building here Chinese Central High School that's it exactly and on this side of the street very close to the bus stop like this try to get the meters right I'm pretty sure uh Geo wizard will get this one easily as well so I'm still on a perfect score at the moment so that I believe is the Taiwan flag that is some bloke from Taiwan I think we might be in San Francisco well I mean that is a clue so I just saw Sacramento so that would be the Street won't it and they're about to head into a tunnel and it's heading south that's a tunnel isn't it yes Stockton tunnel Central Chinese High School Chinese Central High School I mean we're in the middle of that I I I'd be happy with that guess let's see if we can get one meter oh it's six oh that's wrong it's wrong the flag is wrong obviously this is we are not in front of this thing but can we take a second to Marvel at this park really one playground I like that okay let's guess seven meters this time you got me but only only because the the flag was wrong it was in the wrong place this one doesn't count because I lost okay final round let's see if we can get the full score thank you okay so we have English here uh this uh oh I see this looks like this has been tailor-made for chill wizard so there you go you won yeah this looks like um this is somewhere in Great Britain or Ireland and um I have no idea this is probably supposed to be something that I would recognize somehow but I don't know is this the place where the the guy is living who made this one or how is one supposed to to know this one this seems a bit ridiculous doesn't it compared to what we've had before this car is on the right but this car is on the left this car I can't say um they seem to have yellow plate so I'm thinking we are in a Great Britain a very C there possibly yeah I think this there's something uh terribly unfair about this one I I don't know why why is this here uh probably chill wizard can tell me this must be somehow a famous thing or is this is a joke or or what I mean I'm leaning towards this joke There is almost no information to be seen here no Flags box tail Castle down and Saint Marks so I get the feeling that this map has been made by by someone who lives here or something what am I supposed to see here that tells me where I am the dwarf in the garden so assuming that it's somehow possible to know this then maybe this is something like an like Isle of Man or something could this be Castle Town said Marx foxtail [Music] Castle town [Music] [Applause] Foxdale Saint Marks is this the slack or if Castle town is to the South [Music] that's right ah so the assumption that this is doable allows me to figure out where this is I mean yeah if you know Isle of Man it's something else but I don't this is just based on the idea that this is doable so this can't be somewhere generally this has to be some special place uh Foxdale the North sorry here in Saint Marks is the east this one would go right like this can this be there might be a road there balamura straight that is very straight indeed could this be another place oh ape man Adventure Park nice next to laser main sounds like like the place to be so that has to be it that has to be it so basically to me the only way I got this place was making the assumption that this is doable so this is not some random place in uh Great Britain so it has to be a special place the first idea of a special place I got was Isle of Man and that worked I hope this is totally up um chill Wizards alley and by Ali I mean he's Ali like his literal or or maybe metaphorical alley I don't know but right up his alley like you know like up up his alley so let's see what he has to say about this this is my guess right that feels like Island I don't know oh let's look at the sign Castle Town Foxdale Saint Marks so this is this is probably Northern Ireland or is this Scotland and I don't think I don't know I honestly don't know Castle Town Foxdale Saint Marks this might be tricky you know okay at least he doesn't immediately know so I wasn't just like stupid and I'm not disappointed that he doesn't immediately say oh I know this place it's actually might take a while [Music] sweet box style is up there so yeah we're there probably around there it is two yards never got the one yard view summary there it is that was good the Kazakhstan one definitely tested me uh maybe the old detective map is better Mega guess so yeah that is five thousand points again that that flag is a little bit wrong but we got that one 25 000 points was kind of easy except for the last one which uh kind of ruined it a little bit for me I think that wasn't very much fun I think I got lucky that it was Isle of Man it could have been the idea that that is what you're supposed to go to but the difficulty was very different from the from the others I thought the previous ones were too easy this one was too hard but at the same time I I think it was fun to to be on top of things for once you know I guess we couldn't decide who was better between me and Geo wizard if we really want to try to make a difference here I have 13 meters distance he has 18 yards which is slightly more it looks like he spent less time than I did 54 minutes but you have to realize that mine includes watching his video so if you take away about half an hour from mine you will find that mine was slightly faster so I guess you could say that we were for all the intents and purposes equally good I was slightly faster and slightly more accurate although because the flags were not in the right place I don't know if that matters let me know how you

"[Music] foreign this time I'm up here right here in the upper corner this guy down here is Geo wizard today we're going to have uh me versus him uh Play Along video so it will be me versus him versus you okay so gear wizard has uh challenged his viewers to a map called done test for smart people it sounds uh terrifying I'm going to take this challenge you can also take this challenge click on the link below you can play it for free even if you don't have a geocacher subscription so you're not losing anything except maybe your time and possibly your sanity I'm going to play one round get the result then jump back to Geo Wizards video before the time runs out so I don't see my result and then I'm going to watch his video and see his result and then compare with my result last time I tried to do this with all this video making equipment and everything I failed most of the time but that's life you know failing most of the time is how I would describe life and what you should be doing if if you want to play along is the same thing but first play the round or the time runs out you should jump to my video watching me play Jump the jail Wizards video it's crazy it's just it's just insane it's a  in uh in a good way possibly could be in a bad way as well um you can also play The Challenge from beginning to the end to make it more easy for you you know like logistically more easy if there is a text here so that we should probably be red of course you know where these are but do you each famous place has the original location plus one look-alike location let's see if you can recognize the original landmark and if you can pinpoint where its look-alike is 30 famous local locations 30 look-alikes that actually sounds like I'm gonna do terribly on this if you remember my fake Taj Mahal video I also did not take very kindly to people making things that look like Taj Mahal so let's head right into it hi hello everyone why am I grinning I don't know it's been a while how not to travel America gracing your screens very soon not before the trailer which will be out in a week or so now though guys it's Geo guesser time it's geoghasm time that's what he wanted to say uh I'm gonna let you guys play along with this one no moving and no time limit as he said no time limit but also no moving okay well that seems fair enough did you make those does she look guilty did she make these statues like okay so if the idea is to know whether these are real or not I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that there is no chance in hell that these are not real or they are quite small though aren't they supposed to be big oh this one is quite big so yeah so my point is that there's quite a lot of them and they look like they have been there a while so I would be very surprised if these were somebody's idea of of a fun Pastime to to build these things and then pass them off as as real ones on top of that this is definitely on the sea which is where these should be so these are the famous uh I wanted to say Talking Heads but I don't think they talk but they are in the uh Easter Islands now this is indeed a good question do I know where Easter Islands are I'm not completely sure I think they are somewhere here but where are they actually called Easter Islands or not or are they called Bora Bora that sounds somehow familiar to me Bora Bora or is it just because it's so like uh very Dancy Place Bora Bora Bora Bora um so yeah I don't know I think I do know where Easter Islands are not there but I do not know exactly where Easter Islands are that's the problem so this might actually take a while there are all sorts of little Islands here which one of these is the Easter are you the Easter Island no it doesn't even look like the Easter Bunny you know this is not so easy as I thought it would be Mommy foreign that sounds very much to me like that uh Easter Island [Music] yeah why aren't they my statues or something like that so I think I found the island finally uh it actually says kapanui and didn't I see something like this here I I totally saw that Rapa Nui yes so I think this is the right place this person has clothed from the right place so now the question is if if we are in the right place we are looking uh straight to the South so this would make sense here this we have um Hills behind us and we have a rock coming out from the south west there is a hill here I'm thinking this seems like the right place let's see the roads there are some roads here uh do this make any sense one road is going there one would maybe go somewhere here it could be this one but then we would have a road going down that would be I don't know does this go somewhere tough to say So based on the the depth map here I'm thinking rather that this would be this rock then there is another one coming out like this which I don't quite see but that could be very close we could for instance be rather here where we would have this Punta Baya not really not seeing that either okay after after looking around for a while uh I don't really know I can't really interpret the landscape so well I think this um this here is uh this one here but I can't understand the distance from this picture I don't know what this one is here um but it could simply be something like this land coming coming up there at some point very difficult to say um there is a mountain or a hill uh behind us that makes a lot of sense um to see like if there's a hill here that let's see would that it will turn and disappear somewhere uh there so we wouldn't see anything uh but it's very difficult to say there is a house here in the distance that I cannot see so Southwest there is nothing on the map that points to any house uh but anyway I think we are on the right Island these are real I hope so because I spent some time looking around and I'm going to uh guess this place but before that I'm gonna see what Mr chill wizard has to say about this those are the heads on Easter Island surely surely they are the originals that looks like some sort of Maori thing Kappa Nui or something sun is in the north so that would support the idea that we're at Easter Island so where is Easter Island that's also nice to see that he also doesn't know where Easter Island is so I thought that was the the Geo guesser here that doesn't know but he also doesn't know it's not something that you look up from the map very often this might take me a little while to find I think it would say Easter Island unless it's one of those things where they've changed its name he did say Easter Island just not in English I think it is this and that they've changed the name of it on the map to hang a rower right we just got to look now at the coastline it's it's going to be interesting because my other guess would be this hunger those were the two guesses I had but I decided to go with the other one which I might end up regretting I think he's gonna go with this one there is the museum there that would correspond possibly with the building there but I think the building wasn't quite on the on the coast and here on the map it shows it's really on the coast so I'm thinking it's it's not that place but I I don't know it's very difficult to assess distances on on this picture wherever we are we're in line with flip so if we drew a line from the cliff Edge is quite cool actually to that so that would put us ah that would put us more like there and that could be it now we've got to be here we've got to be here I'm just going to click that's too far away anyway so I think I think we are there let's have a go  Wit oh I was right or 980 I was wrong okay let's let's just check mine uh my guess here um was uh closer it was a little bit more to the west but yeah that area was the correct area indeed it's that uh vocal length or whatever it's it's very it's caused the picture to be very flattened everything looks to be very close in fact the clips back in the distance have to be very far away um because if if the if the airport is a normal size airport with something like two kilometer Runway then this is at least like five or six kilometers away from those Hills I don't think you can really assess the distances from that picture yeah and I mean this is his distance here this was uh already three point that's actually even more I mean this is this is five kilometers here so it's 10 kilometers to the to the cliff okay so we're gonna go for the next round I hope you can see me a little bit better now so next round okay so this is how it's going to work I suppose so we got the uh first the real ones and this is a pretty obvious one that this is not the real one the question is where are these this looks like um Chinese script or it could be Japanese they look Japanese text is Japanese um so we are somewhere in Japan where they are showcasing these uh these statues or uh replicas of them at least that's pretty easy to see that they are replicas but where are we we are in the east coast of Japan um nothing else to be seen here this could be an island oh hi I love this age when kids like they know how to walk but the walking is always somehow awkward that's really funny to to watch them do that and clearly this this kid has just learned to walk because that is walking behind to to to catch the kid Okay so we could be in one of the islands here what if one of these islands has like there is a zoo for instance a village of the sea uh there is some kind of a monument here so this looks like a very good option for being an island where they would have put these things I'm thinking we are in some kind of some kind of Island I'm not gonna spend forever here don't worry I'm just gonna check if I happen to actually come across uh this thing uh there is a toilet I saw a toilet so maybe it's this one I'm obviously joking but it could be that one I'm not gonna go through all the islands and all the possible areas in Japan that would be Insanity I'm going to go with the first one that makes some sense and that would be this Oshima Island that has a zoo park why well we have butterflies here that pizza zoo park doesn't it we got some other stuff here not sure what that is but there is something more than just these things this is not just an ordinary park there is a building there up in the hills so this could totally be a zoo park for instance though it doesn't have that sort of a cliff to the east what about this area here yeah I would really want it to be that zoo park but I don't think it is I don't know what that is but I'm gonna go here and because there is like an area like this straight to the like Southeast so it's gonna be like this maybe I'm just gonna go there and see what happens let's see if Geo wizard knows where this is oh my God so this is the so maybe this map is programmed to give you the original and then somehow they give you the alternative the the copy or the other way around so this is the copy you'd have to be pretty dumb to think that this was the original because I agree you've got Asian writing as well haven't you yeah you've got like Japanese writing there oh look at this little toddler toddling over yeah that's that's the most interesting part about this picture that looks Japanese that I'm not sure Greek almost it's really confusing what is that there is something odd about that script I have to uh admit I wonder if we can be on one of these you know ah is that a map of the island it looks a bit squared isn't it it looks a bit like runescaping I thought that was the map of the the park whatever that is but yeah I guess it could be a map of the island that's not too dissimilar no look at that isn't it the upside down it's like it should be the upside down but I still wonder why would they have a map of the whole island there why wouldn't like if you are in a some sort of a zoo or a museum area or something like a park or whatever you generally have a map of that Park and not the whole uh Island unless it's a very small island almost identical to that but flipped flipped around yeah to Japanese people around you can see the boxy bit there apologies if I'm wrong about this I think I am wrong actually it comes too far down here it's pretty close screw it I'm gonna go back to the upside down math screw it will go here how wrong could this be um what look at that we were actually on Japan yeah so I'm just gonna make my guess as well so clearly the idea that this would be an island was simply wrong and that probably made it pretty much impossible to find it because no sane person is going to go through the east coast of Japan trying to find this place unless they're in insane sane person I was a little bit closer probably but a very mediocre result I think it's much more important to be able to find the actual Easter Island and these Maui statues it's uh San Mesa oh there it is different models of Easter Island statues it is possible to find but nobody would zoom in that close and go through the whole of Eastern Seashore of Japan I think it's impossible to get if you do not know around no no you're not going to fool me this is supposed to be Dash Mahal but this I don't buy the other one I did so shame on me this is very obviously not the real Tash Mahal don't even try where is it is the question um yeah the sun is comfortably in the north so that's very interesting because that would probably mean that we could still be maybe for instance in Sri Lanka or something in a certain time of the year but it looks like we are really in the southern hemisphere this text I cannot read it could be like could it be a rapid it could be Arabic I don't like to do that but I know that Geo wizard will do that that the picture was taken by Abdullah al-mam probably an Arabic person these are very well camouflaged these could be Indians but I don't think they are I'm thinking we are in an Arabic country somewhere in the South that's gonna be my my guess Muslim countries in the South really only leave us with uh Indonesia oh we do have something like Maldives for instance it looks quite dark she not so much hmm many minutes later okay so this is gonna be an insane guess but um at least it's more interesting than a less insane guest I've been thinking about this and looking around so I'm going with my intuition that this is not a Latin script this is also not Hindi or something like this because there's always this line on top so there is no such line here on the top this is probably not Sri Lankan text because that is very round this is not but I cannot read the text and I'm not sure and that might be my downfall I will believe the the sun although I'm inclined not to the sun is in the north so we are in the southern hemisphere Arabic script in southern hemisphere uh there's really only a couple of options that come to mind one is The Melodies I'm not gonna go through all the Melodies I checked like the main island and and stuff like this and I didn't find anything of the sort but there are so many islands so many things to look Maldives would make sense to me Indonesia is Muslim but they would have Latin script so that leaves me with with uh Somalia which is not exactly in the southern hemisphere but it's pretty close so I went to Mogadishu didn't find anything particular but I did find some sort of a Hindi restaurant thing so I decided that this is an omen so I am going to go ahead and click in the center of Mogadishu here's an interesting choice isn't it and it makes some sense so we'll see I'm quite interested to see let's see what uh it's your wizard does I reckon that is the fake Taj Mahal that's I think that's Muslim headgear which would exist in India Abdullah Al mamun also sounds but definitely Muslim the sun is in the north the sun is in the North very confusing isn't it no the compass must be wrong dude the compass might be wrong but I'm not going to play something like this with so little information with the assumption that the compass is wrong because pretty much that's all I got that's gotta be wrong so I'm thinking Pakistan or at least near nearby are mad about Abdullah Ahmed similar names by the palace and dig in Asana Temple it's just gonna be a church isn't it oh screw it I'm not gonna be anywhere near it anyway oh it was Bangladesh oh okay yeah a bit sad because it it tells me that the compass was definitely wrong so my guess was uh absolutely horrible um but at least it was on the right side of the of the earth I guess banglar Tash Mahal Taj Mahal replica it was in the South that's the thing it was as backwards the compass was just completely wrong Geo wizard was right in in doubting that uh I was wrong in trusting Humanity a mistake I will never do again bloody well Bangladesh didn't consider that did I oh we did not get that was just a fluke actually that we got the same thing as a replica who would make a replica of isn't this Taipei uh 101 or what's it called this one is that it is that right I think so um yeah that's the right building so that can't be a replica right cine Plaza yeah this is absolutely the right place and this is a very easy one I guess then so we're probably if this is the parking lot maybe here yeah that's it that's my guess it's got to be Taipei was for a while the tallest building in the world for about five or six years don't quote me but here we go Taipei this would be a quick one are we next to a park nope we are not oh what's up surely not but that's the park right there come on man there's no way in hell that the all of this was recreated so I'm fairly confident that we can go with my guess there it is so that kind of is a park five yards let's see what mine is two meters yes I win two meters is better than five yards if you didn't know now you know but our first perfect score of the day what pleased with that final round okay so this looked like looks like uh what you call it um yeah what you call it but is this the real one is this the real deal the real deal let's see let's see what's it called again um is it is it this one that this one is pointing possibly like we I don't know like if I could trust the compass but this would be pointing to the to the West what do you call this thing I've forgotten um Amphitheater looks like this could be just a Amphitheater this doesn't have those sides so I'm not sure but I'm going to first put here I'm thinking we're thinking of some other Amphitheater that right now I can remember which one you would maybe see some mountains but where is the city you can't see any of the city itself which Amphitheater is this so it's it's not this one I don't think it's this one on the left you would have buildings there's quite a lot of amphitheaters here we also have um Amphitheater so if we were here we were looking West there would be mostly the city but possibly also just not visible and then to the left you would have a hill but to the right well there could be just trees in front okay I'm I'm giving up yeah I can't crack this one I don't think it's the one in Athens but maybe it's this one here there's quite a few places where it could be I looked at all The Usual Suspects and I couldn't find it maybe I'm supposed to think of something specific like yeah but I I nothing comes to mind right now so um let's see how he does this is quite hard because you either know it or you don't and you certainly ain't gonna if you know where the the replica is you're just a nerd really but anyway I'm having fun so this guy is called Mehmet Abbasi so I'm guessing this is the fake Coliseum that's uh interesting idea that this would be a Coliseum fake call assume I mean I guess it could be well I mean it's just a ruin it could somebody's idea of a fake Coliseum but this is this I don't think this is a fake this is a this is an Amphitheater just a normal Amphitheater uh but I guess it could also be like a fake Coliseum sure they call the same or at least a Coliseum so uh he hasn't really said anything I just decided that uh I'm not going to go with the guest that I did because I don't think this is this makes any sense um this is rather maybe somewhere in an island it could be something like Cyprus I'm just gonna go because I I don't think I don't know where am I supposed to like guess but uh this is just somewhere in the boonies I think with some mountains so let's go into Cyprus and hope for the best instead uh I think it's more interesting than going like 100 kilometers off of Athens just because you don't think it's Athens so let's see what happens it could be a number of countries those trees do look Italian to me but could be turkey oh look at this yeah I saw that text but it didn't tell me anything and I'm pretty sure it's just the name of the companies I mean if anything that kind of sounds Serbian noise or something although they would have the Cyrillic ah what about Croatian are there any are there any colosseums in Croatia the Roman Empire in Croatia what stamp what Mark did they make that's what I want to know you know what I'm not doing very well I'm I'm kind of going with my heart today I'm going to keep with that yeah hi um you might have noticed that I got frozen in a very pensive position so you might think that I died or something you might have watched with anxiety oh I ran out of battery on my iPhone that I use for camera I didn't know this so unfortunately the last couple of minutes is gonna be without the camera I don't think you're losing that much you can still watch still wizard he's very handsome it's all good I I like that we both have done pretty poorly in fact so um I think it's nice to just try something different that's part of the reason why I went to Cyprus instead of just a little bit left of of Evans uh if you don't know then make some interesting guess my my guess of Mogadishu was certainly interesting but you could also try not to be really stupid I've never heard of a an episode theater did I say Coliseum earlier yeah sorry I didn't mean Colosseum policy it went all the way around didn't it any of the trees up at the top sorry for frustrating you um with my choices of words as usual I no longer know what this is a copy of but it's a Roman thing I'm gonna go somewhere around split as I say I don't know of any Roman amphitheaters in Croatia but why not It's gotta be one and I'm gonna go Solano I'm so sorry if this is in Italy oh that's interesting um it was in Turkey he did mention that the person who made the the picture was Turkish or I mean his name is Turkish he didn't say he was Turkish but the name was Turkish Cyprus wasn't right but it was uh the right direction in the in the world for sure no it was then uh wronged the other direction yes I persist too much to that the day is an ancient Outdoors theater in FS lots of you are going to have beaten me for sure I mean I'd say most of you is that the original then we'll never know this is the original I was wrong on all counts that wasn't a copy of anything let's view the summary so I think I I have lost this one or did I in fact win oh surprisingly enough I did I guess I got slightly better score than otherwise yeah Color Me surprised I thought I lost it with uh Somalia foreign ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

where are you [Laughter] right next to the place called lucky lucky lucky lucky lucky wow welcome back to geochism it is time to play another capitals of the world map uh I have not played this one before it says it has 195 capitals of the world it says it's very hard we're gonna have a 10 minute round times but no moving and I am going to make this a challenge so you can play along if you want to just click on the link below before you watch this video and then come back here and you can compare the results let me know how you did let's start the game that's wow that's nice this is this is something new this is this is something very interesting that I am not used to um we do have a compass but I'm not sure if that is correct I do not immediately recognize this City from up here there's plenty to unpack here first of all do they fly their flag somewhere here on the coast see anything at least no flag so what do we have otherwise we have some other churches or mosques [Music] don't really know where to start this looks maybe [Music] a middle eastern or maybe southern Europe BM perhaps [Music] I would say this is very historical in any case um this be something like a Tunis let's look at um foreign has two openings of the north east that does not crack what about laughs foreign [Music] we're looking at the capital city on the coast [Music] what about Malta yes that's looking good that is looking good we have a central island like this [Music] then on the right we have this fort yes this is making a lot of sense then we have this yeah that's it yeah that makes a lot of sense that's that's how it kind of looks like it's just a bit difficult I'm not used to seeing this so high up um so we're looking at it from Saints Elmo the Heritage building we are pretty much here I'm not even sure how this works is this the the picture that we are actually looking at here so anyway this is this is my guess I think I cracked it this is Valletta Malta baby 5 000 points um yeah at first I was a bit confused by this but um just calmly thinking about how it looks like from um from the architecture point of view we know it's a capital city so there's actually not so many options at the end and so multimix perfect sense that's easy to recognize let's continue [Laughter] um this is more difficult Maybe because I can't see anything that's not a very good picture unlike the last one yeah this is not a very good picture at all this could be a EU flag but that's not gonna be very helpful either it seems to me that you're driving on the right we have a Christian Church here we have one I don't know one could this be one thousand oh I wish that was not such a blurry picture this is just very annoying and maybe that's not even a EU flag I just can't see anything in this picture um that doesn't honestly make it so much fun um looking for Clues and such the vegetation does track when I think of Europe the signs kind of look like it don't quite see like you played here though but could that mean that we are in um no if that's a if that's a new plate and there should be plates but uh EU flag that's not the new played probably well if it is 1000 let's assume that there's one thousand then it has to be Europe it doesn't have EU plates so it would have to be um for instance Switzerland burn for instance [Music] [Applause] [Applause] if it is not burn what could it be of course it could be something even smaller like bad news I didn't I think of that [Music] Liechtenstein is that's a country too right right um oh real Tony that's me well that's a sign isn't it about a sign of what they don't seem to really have any churches in this place that doesn't really seem like it what about uh Dora [Music] [Applause] no I didn't see it I do see Hills right did I see Hills foreign yeah I guess a good piecing Hills that's San Marino as well [Music] you fit the layout of the city or the cigarette I'm stumped I am quite interested to see what place this is maybe it's just the blurriness of the picture maybe these are you cars no idea I guess we're going for burn they wear you cars that was Ljubljana okay well whatever I did not enjoy that round in the slightest it feels annoying to be surrounded by so much information and not being able to see it uh Slovenia is part of European Union so they should have EU plates and I didn't see that the only thing I could see was that it has the flag and that was the only thing I couldn't trust so nothing much to be done there I was right about it being somewhere in Central Europe so it could have been worse for sure I guess I've already reached the average score in two rounds without moving so I guess I should be happy with myself so let's see if I can get luckier with the next round okay that's a lot more information that's that looks nice that looks much nicer that's a bit too much to ask for I suppose so if we can find where we are we are at 80 Willis Street so this could be um this could be Washington this could be London this could be um what could this be on apart from that doesn't seem to be London because of the plates not being yellow that guy at least thinks he has a lot of style and Swagger I don't slang up bang I just smoke [ __ ] like it ain't no thing [Music] oh it goes to Banana bills hanging from the side I'm not impressed but honestly I don't think I'm the target audience that he's going for there are mountains is that a really a mountain is that that mountain is area in the back City chick kissy chicks kissy chicks and that's just next to QC Cathedral I mean actually surprised that there is no immediate no immediate uh giveaway here um that I can see not that I can see um there are no Shadows so I can't tell where the sun is industry is that supposed to be German there hmm so this play doesn't tell me anything they are driving on the left so I am thinking of New Zealand here or possibly Australia but some mountains in the distance maybe do you have a willy Street in the center they do have a willy Street they do have a willy Street do they actually have numbers on this map wow that's crazy really Street 80. wow yep that's it nailed it right here I'm not your map you're wrong you're wrong about that but whatever five thousand points nice I'm joking on my coffee that's so nice how did he get that well predominantly English language there were some names there that could have been construed as some kind of Aboriginal or local name some Kuka or whatever um driving on the left and mountains in the distance that really doesn't live much live much uh options actually when you think about it was not in Europe it was not in England driving on the left so not in the in the states or or America generally so I guess it could have been some obscure Island somewhere but it wasn't it was just a a very famous island wow five thousand points I think I was closer than Geo guesser I'm pretty sure my my DOT was was better place but I didn't lose any points for that let's continue okay this is interesting yes so we have Arabic Arabic Arabic and Arabic and even more Arabic oh and there's also some Arabic there so I'm guessing we are in some Arabic country these what prayer tell me are these are these these don't look these don't look Arabic at all what are those things looks like a heart that's that's come topsy-turvy so it must be some kind of a local language perhaps this guy looks like he's really touching cars here uh good luck mister really need it this guy is coming coming for you and this guy too everybody's coming for you driving on the right [Music] man [Music] hey could that be eping um yeah we totally could be look look at this these signs here this is the top security heart artist districts in are these numbers are these Arabic numbers are no is that a wrap what is this something to Google again yes I think those are numbers well that doesn't that doesn't tell me that we are in Tehran after all but I thought I saw here chambran and something this could be decent yeah I'm just dreaming foreign [Music] that's really funny with this um with this picture here like this guy [Music] is this just like triplets laughs strange picture card [Music] that reminds me of something is that a city somewhere [Music] I feel like I should should know what that is I mean it's not a capital but it could be a city or in that country I just need to jump in here to say that yeah buzzer got a that's like the ancient capital of the of the Persian Empire under the Cyrus the Great so I know it from playing civilization so that's pretty cool huh bye is there a there's a woman there walking without too much of a headdressing thing the pharmacy there's some English here but not really very much your instructions on how to use uh lights it's clearly this guy hasn't read Because this is clearly red and everybody's going and the police is just looking at the situation not giving a [ __ ] but honestly what do I expect [Music] Tehran is by far my best guess by far there's nothing that tells me that this isn't Tehran so I don't really know why I should move from there yeah that's it that's that's my guess [Applause] that's it that was the correct guess that was really my only idea I don't know if the if the sign said anything like their run I don't know but that at least made me think of that round there are some things like there are Museum of Contemporary Art of University of Tehran that it could have referred to there are districts that are numbered that would explain some of the numbers in designs or possibly diverse simply numbers in the science I don't know but in any case as soon as I thought about it that made a lot of sense it looked like it should it looked at the same time quite um modern like there were guys walking with fairly modern clothes the women the women the women not so many of them but they didn't seem completely oppressed like in Kabul for instance and um not very like touristic like Iran uh it's not one of the like main uh touristic destinations I guess for various reasons I test between me and you um so this is gonna be another um lingo gas and so I'm a little you know slow sometimes they don't speak Arabic in Iran they speak Farsi or Persian Layman like me like an uncivilized person like me doesn't really recognize the difference between the Farsi and the rapid script so sorry for everyone who does and things that that's really an insult to to civilization and to humanity that I'm like yeah that's a rabbit script whatever yeah yeah it happens yeah try to distinguish between Finnish and Estonian but but it's really quite interesting because because the upside down heart was actually the key to all of it like like like a heart is sometimes a key like like or you know sometimes something is a key to someone's heart in this case the heart was the key to to to to some thing um yeah that that there was an analogy there but it kind of kind of ran away from me anyway the upside down heart is indeed a number but not in a rapid script that's why I hadn't seen it before it's a number in Persian script and that's why it is indeed specific to Tehran so the fact that I would find an upside down heart on the picture was actually a dead giveaway that this is the run and I was right of course all of that my friend is pure luck because I didn't know any of it but in any case when in doubt follow your upside down heart that you see on the map yeah got that kids at home if you don't know nothing just look at something that looks weird and similar and just run with it unless it's someone who looks really weird like a guy it looks kind of like your dad in that it is a guy then don't run with that guy foreign yeah so don't do that kids but otherwise I think that's Sound Advice this channel gives you as it is you get the geoghasm you get the lingo gasm you get the data you get the information you get the explanation you get the sweet sweet salivation The salivation Good Vibration and excitation whatever I I've I've lost all my words I would give all my words to you but I have lost them so if you see my words let me know I need to go bye bye yes it's the final round ah we get one of these things is that the Gibraltar by any chance surely not never been there but um so this guy this guy looks like tuko from uh Breaking Bad from from behind I I'm pretty sure it's too cold so let's stay away from that these look like the the things that that are used for for airports some sort of um they help with uh with the navigation or whatever a lot of building going on here quite a lot of building building building um otherwise this looks very like not very big to be honest but I guess the the city has to be somewhere behind that Hills more or less the Sun is in the North very clearly so don't keep router what are you guys building in there Islands hmm this one is very difficult southern hemisphere there is uh some sort of a peninsula going to the west and then possibly as a sea going in I'm thinking of um outskirts somehow of Rio De Janeiro or something like this and the Mongoose remind me of that so let's that's not the capital of course silly me capital of Brazil is not Rio Janeiro so there goes that idea also the sea is very comfortably to the West Northwest Southwest but this guy doesn't look particularly black so I don't think we are in in this area we would rather than be here could be theoretically be Lima [Music] um if we were here there would be some big island there like this and smaller one [Music] to the South you know that's too far Maybe that could theoretically track if this is that area and then another but not really not really this one comes out quite a lot so there's no way if we look well if you look straight to the South from here you could see this island so if we were here but there's like an Beach here on the South Side could this be a beach uh not really it doesn't look like anybody's there but let's keep that in mind [Music] um let's keep Lima in mind three minutes later tuko where are you [Laughter] cool the Sun is indeed in the North [Music] you have to use something Crown Plaza could be one of them Islands somewhere [Music] part Morris B [Music] and that could be to the West this sort of thing with the road going around it South uh East an island [Music] like this straight to the east where's East now is this the is this um thread to the West I mean is another Island could be this one well this is this is a huge Gamble oh yeah I am not screaming because my daughter is asleep Jesus Christ what right next to the place called lucky lucky lucky lucky wow wow Jesus Christ that was probably the most Geographic geographm of all time immediately as I saw this I thought that that fits with this little island here with this island stare but Jesus who who could have fought Bert Morris B had you even heard of Port modus had you even heard of Bart Morris B before this sometimes people say oh it can't be true it must be cheating I thought the same thing sometimes but you know when you play this a lot yeah you know sometimes you just wave them but sometimes you get lucky so let me explain at least a little bit here um so I did get kind of like okay so we are in southern hemisphere so we we have a limit here we're southern hemisphere although I was looking a bit up of that as well because the sun wasn't so so clear we have not like a black person um we had a capital city that all is already there's less than 200 of them facing western and southern sea so it has to look so that the sea is to the west and to the South it turns out there's not so many of them I mean there's plenty but not so many like if we went through here it's like yeah it can't be Chile can't really be Buenos Aires sure it could be among the video but there was also Hills and montevideos not hilly it can't be Brazil Paraguay Bolivia it could have been Lima but we checked that it didn't fit it can't be Ecuador Colombia where it's sorry you know you get the point it can't be any of these it didn't seem to be any of these uh there were some smaller Islands left but yeah and it didn't look like Africa so I ignored all of these yeah and then I just came here and looking at the a Kuala Lumpur is also not on the I mean it's it could be here but the city itself is not on the on the coast so that's my friend oh I eventually towards the end of my time came to the idea of checking this place because look at it it looks right to Southwest and so I took a look and it it matched that's all there is to it and uh yeah lucky lucky oh I found two calls Mark morrispy who would have thought okay let's see the summary oh 23 098 points first try on this map I got them all except the second one which was really just the picture really sucked um so I'm I'm still quite happy with the result here considering the picture but you think that you'd get a better picture from Ljubljana yeah pretty pretty good stuff let me know if you managed to do even better and let me know about your adventures of trying to find uh Portmore speed yes that went down in history I'd say I hope you have enjoyed that has been a geoghasm and you have seen a geographm I hope you have enjoyed if you have please do leave a like consider subscribing pushing any of the buttons that are around and stuff that will appear in here in the screen that really helps me a lot because this is an emerging Channel and this will never be found by anybody so if you think someone else should find this someone else might enjoy this please press a like and it might just happen thanks for coming oh tight tight tight yeah I don't slang up bang I just smoked [ __ ] like it ain't no thing [Music] yeah

today I decided to try something different why don't we try the world map with plenty of time to spare as you can see here this is the classic world map so you can play along you can test the same map with the same settings I'm going to give myself 15 minutes per round to try to get a perfect score that's my aim nothing less my best result is 24 609 round time ah okay 10 minutes fair enough I will make a challenge I will copy the link and start the game all right so let's don't look particularly European we have pizza so I'm assuming we are in uh South America but this looks actually like is that Greek this Creek isn't it no look at that so these are these actually you plates on Mr price so we are in Chris somewhere now we have to find out we're in Greece we are International Foods Greek products I saw a Greek flag so we are totally in Greece [Music] what if we are in fact in Cyprus [Music] what if we are in fact in Cyprus because there was a text that said something about Nicosia [Music] that could explain uh [Music] the International Foods Acropolis essays is there a hotel Acropolis [Music] I do not know but I will keep that in mind I don't know what that flag is [Music] okay so I think I'm wrong because this says let me post Acropolis would of course point to Athens doesn't really look like it three minutes later I just don't think we are in Athens but I can't say Where We Are can't find it [Music] we already are in summer Island learn some Island but which one foreign [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Applause] wow I couldn't quite crack it see I sorry I was so quiet with the rest I look I was looking at this this form of the island on the map and I found it and then I went for the capital of this third big place and I then I saw that there is a port in the right direction and I was looking if I could see a hotel that that I I had seen but I didn't 536 meters that was a tight one last minute save lost two points so no perfect score but we are way on our way very very delightfully put to better score than than ever before really good start okay this is Ireland probably uh based on the color of the of the the signs there's M1 and worksop M1 is somewhere I'm sure pretty sure M1 is somewhere or any of these places Sheffield it doesn't sound uh right [Music] this doesn't Newark isn't that is this Newark isn't that the London Airport the London Airport [Music] am I just am I completely wrong here is this London area [Music] where is M1 there is M1 okay works up I don't know what I'm on about with Newark Workshop is right here a619 towards the east and A6 one six [Music] a618 there's a delightful amount of logic here at least a616 towards Newark a619 [Music] M1 so I'm thinking we are somewhere right around this this looks right doesn't it let's go and find the a street name to get the the corner right three minutes later so I'm right here [Laughter] okay yeah I I clicked outside of the road that was an easy one very easy although I went I I was out of it for a while uh despite the easiness of the information uh I thought we were in Ireland based on the color of the of the signs so stupid me then I thought was the airport um I'm very confused but anyway I got it and five thousand points so still in business let's go okay this is looking considerably more difficult getting immediate Bolivia Vibes here but we're driving on the left apparently so we are in Africa so much further Bolivia wipes something okay driving on the left the Sun uh difficult to say let's see if we can find something else something all right [Music] so English language we deliver anywhere that's a promise um something I don't know this could be like Kenya or something I don't know if they have a place called something who knows it's still mountainous for Kenny right that's it is it two mountainous for Kenya oh thank you very much you can't even see anything from there you have a huge flag right in front of your face yeah this is what I was thinking about it's two mountainous for Kenya that is the flag of South Africa that makes more sense I think um something in South Africa [Music] Middleburg by the way has some llamas if you're interested get bit more information that something looks like a very very small place I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to see it if I discovered the map [Music] so it seems like they are not going to grace me with any other information whatsoever so I'm going to actually have to look for the sun thing I suppose 30 minutes later I unfortunately simply cannot find it and I get no information what is the name of this road what is the number of this road it's just something somewhere in South Africa small place Mountains east Southeast no sign of the sea [Music] all right foreign that's it very sad wow it was it was just the primary school it was impossible to find that was just impossible to find too bad there goes the record there goes the Run foreign very disappointing um no amount of time helped on that one that looks like we are in Florida [Music] Kingswood for older people that makes a lot of sense being in Florida I guess next we're gonna see Osama being eaten by a crocodile car Trump's past Christina probably also for older people only um Riverview Orthopedic Institute Florida is totally living up to its reputation [Music] Riverview so I guess that makes it likely that we are somewhere in Riverview but is that a city or a part of City [Music] that didn't yeah I don't think this is that didn't pick up drop off is Magic stud student [Music] foreign [Music] uh Kingswood not South East [Music] come on Riverview [Music] and we are on wow Riverview [Music] Crossing boyet I don't know why I'm so confused by this which direction are we going South I'll be around boyet I thought we were on this other Road [ __ ] okay that explains why I was so confused so this is that corner and the river uh doesn't go right here uh River Creek probably it used to go here foreign [Music] to get the Perfect Score we are about here got it sorry about that confusion I was under the impression that we were on this road and that's why I was really confused about the directions and it turns out that I had a reason to be confused because we were on this road uh yeah finally found it I got slightly lucky um I just decided to look into the cities a little bit Orlando Tampa and and it's jumped into my into my eye this eye a lot of homes for old people that's Florida for you as far as I've understood but then there is a school next to it as well but uh not for students but only for students so I guess those are people who are learning to be studs what do I know it's Florida it's it's just it's just weird that's what I learned all I know about Florida I learned from John Oliver so thanks John it's very helpful okay final round we know the record is lost but let's let's try to get a good score anyway we are driving on the left we appear to be in Africa quite green um very green indeed could this be Uganda that's very helpful someone is telling us what the letters are uh just in case oh that is the Kenyan flag yes Kenya is obviously the other option um being Neighbors so that's probably a school and that would explain why they have letters uh uh hello um many many greetings to Kenya Mr [Music] Ministry of kisi County sounds like County that's how it looks like there is there it is you see yeah I was thinking it must be somewhere here very close to well not close to Uganda per se but this sort of area uh yeah there it is kissy County well that doesn't mean that we are in QC of course uh we're interesting but Ministry of Health Center Health Center it's a lot of neon here going on that's not very helpful I'm gonna think all of these places are near is here luckily this is not a very big County wonder what this Nia means [Music] it used to be everywhere [Music] are you kidding me I'm kidding me aren't you I can't even quite see what it is it's just some near something and well everything is near something here isn't it uh I can't find it I can't find it ah I need something more this is not a very big Health Center to be honest uh no offense um your health center appears to be very very small um this is such a seems to be such a small place that and with this Nia thing I I don't know um I don't know I wish I wish I knew but I don't know 30 minutes later a Michael Secondary School in kissy come on you see chicks I like that sorry chicks I don't have time for that I don't have time for that oh my God where are you I might go no [Music] that wasn't even that was even barely kissy County you see oh I guess technically this in case we can't be home of Champions orphanage home a Michael there was a mic up here oh that was a tough one but oh wow kissy kissy chicks foreign I mean um yeah this might not be the highest level of humor but at least there's a lot of it but it lacks in quality it gains in quantity PC Galore that was it with the the record try pretty good score without the South Africa 17 kilometers pretty good points though not too bad just when we spent way too much time in in kissy County looking for something Nyan or nia uh in place that has basically only Nia everywhere uh I don't know like that's just that's just insane yeah what does it mean um okay Mia I guess Kenya I'm I'm thinking there is something going on here Kenya Nia let's Google that uh Mia in Tanzania language means to defecate or to urinate how to use defecate in a sentence uh uh the next morning they were able to eat but by evening they were uncomfortable because they could not defecate check defecated in the suit and it came to life as a new entity oh no this this went horribly wrong I'm thinking I I'm doing something wrong here Swahili English dictionary says that Nia means to defecate or to urinate so let's see what does cat mean Que it doesn't mean anything well uh this has been a lingo gasm you never know what you're gonna get on this channel so now now you know if you didn't know how you know hi um just between you and me um yeah the the Nia thing yeah so um I asked uh Kenny and friend of mine uh yeah hi tausi um about this whole near thing and it's complicated so Swahili it turns out is a bit complicated first of all Kissy Kissy Kissy that's a good joke that is a a place where they have the local dialects right so that probably means something in there in their local dialects and um it's probably doesn't mean [ __ ] I mean it means something I don't mean that it doesn't mean [ __ ] in the sense that it doesn't mean anything I mean that it it doesn't literally mean to defecate it means something else and uh Nia it actually also means rain it turns out so it's kind of more like something is you know falling from something you know like from Uranus and thirdly the name Kenya is actually not surprisingly enough Swahili I I have internet here and it says that Kenya is actually named after the mountain of the same name which I thought was the opposite I honestly thought that mount Kenya was named like this because it's a mountain in Kenya but it turns out the country is named after the mountain right and according to to internet no kikuyu people get that straight referred to the mountain as Kiri niaga or quereniaga mountain of whiteness obvious reasons for anybody who has seen a tall mountain and the name Kenya comes from that so it does not mean to defecate okay yeah that's a little bit little bird play there at the end like okay yeah just to keep it fun and cool yeah yeah anyway I just wanted to clarify that uh I got to go bye uh I think it's better that I end this episode before it gets any worse let's look at the summary 22 423 points uh let me know how you did did you uh did you get to South Africa I guess that's the big question so what that means that means that the Quest for uh perfect score in the world map continues so let me know what you thought about this by clicking on the buttons around you that most uh speak to your innermost feelings see you next time you have been watching geochism thanks for coming ", "locations":

everyone I'm up here this time on the top left corner the guy down there is Geo wizard maybe you didn't notice any difference maybe you thought I have changed the way I look maybe this is the first time you're watching my content I am up here I'm the geogamous today we're going to do something very different we are going to react to tear Wizards video of playing the 198 capitals of the world before this you should be watching the previous video in which case I was uh playing along the same map so Geo wizard has copied the link for everybody to enjoy uh I have played the same map as him so I recommend that you go back to the previous video and get the link and play the same map yourself if you're not into that at least watch the video of me playing that map first and then you can come back here so there are gonna be spoilers obviously in this video about what our did in the previous video so let's go this is my first uh uh geogaster reacts video luckily Geo wizard is is a great uh great YouTuber on his own so even if I just get quiet this is going to be quality content hey Timbers shiver my Timber um I'd be happy how we doing everyone I'm a little agitated I'm a little stressed why is that well in three hours time I'm going to London to fly to Boston for how not to travel America I want to make two geoguessive videos because I don't want to leave you guys with nothing I want you to have something to watch while I'm away the issue is um I haven't got long to do it so what it's going to be is to play along videos that I'm Gonna Leave You similar maps to what we're used to um so to play along videos that means we are going to have a second one of this so please do click some buttons and tell me how you like this one if you want to see me do the second one whatever that may be let me know why don't we just do three minutes per round because that way there's a definite ceiling to the time I can spend searching and it's the same for you because you're going to play along right yeah that's a good idea sorry I've got let's do it to his nose here we go I don't know how this is so here uh for all of you who are also equally confused as I was in the beginning um this is not going to be the first round this is not the first round in the link that he he actually gives down below he will soon go back and and change the settings this might be [ __ ] this might be really unenjoyable for you first one oh have I just gotten no moving panning or zooming I have I can't do that I can't do that man copy that boom here we are here's our first capital city and well there we go I was just about to say I wonder if I can get this without moving um without even having it was faster to notice it but I was for sure I think that's almost entirely possible because I look to the left and there I saw Andorra the tiny country that will easily give away this um this answer I mean I think we can get this spot on because small country small capital uh it's Andorra lavella isn't it yeah so we'll be I mean I will move shall I move I'm tempted not to I'm tempted just to be stubborn and not showing off Alba I'll Bear yeah we let's have a look here let's see if he gets a bit luckier with finding that I mean we've still got two minutes I'm trying I'm just gonna try and literally not have to edit this video whatsoever so it might seem a bit weird are we there oh see yeah Hotel best Andorra Center so and you can see the shape of that building there is perfectly yeah Cal cat cell bear we've got it cool cat Sal bear is what I would call it but that's just me um there we go we can guess that with a minute to spare wow Heathrow here I come 5 000 points what a cracking way to start didn't even need the full three minutes didn't you need to move beat me in that one easily God I'm good uh by seven points by full seven points that is an Angola flag oh yes it is the Angola flag is one of my favorite Flags I think um because I used to have a flag book when I was a kid and it would be Antigua and Barbuda it would be one of the first ones Afghanistan would be one of the first but Angola I always thought oh what is that that's an interesting logo still don't know what it means let me know in the comments angolan's um we're in a castle so we're in Luanda this is a big are we there four to laser how did he do that oh my god I've just zoomed in to the kind of place you know near the sea where you'd get four and then I saw that photo laser the sound Miguel I forgot that they speak Portuguese that is the sea isn't it I thought that was some sort of um white roof thing yeah we are here because you can see the shape of the castle coming out so we're definitely there and I've got time to spare again to check if we're recording and we are oh God what am I doing are you recording well that's just amazing what a day um I'm going there guys nine yards wow okay granted two fairly easy rounds there and you're gonna have to watch I agree they're easy rounds but I have to say zooming in like that it's it's uncanny how uh some of these better players can uh can find the right place uh yes you can get the right country you can get the right City but then it's the the grind of of finding the right Road the right hotel or whatever so zooming in into a city of this size right into the Fortress Color Me impressed um yeah two fairly easy rounds it has to be said some of the rounds you've seen me have before have been nigh on impossible to to get in any time however um oh what was I going to say see these are the moments you're gonna have to put up with is this good content is this what is this worse than no content hopefully not it's funny because if if his contact is bad conduct then what is my content uh commenting on his content uh it's derivative second uh degree [ __ ] right here we go third round something Remos Contigo so this could be harder because we've got Spanish writing we've got we're driving on the right um doesn't look poor hang on let me look around so I'm interested to see what what kind of sign will he find to to realize okay this is Chile Argentina there's the sun in the north slightly look if you look there line it up with the compass so Argentina but we're in a capital remember so could it be Uruguay this is capitals of the world in case you didn't know so I'm now looking for a flag or something these I mean that that will be a big giveaway for many of you don't think we can be in hang on a minute but we can't be in Peru yeah that would be the colors surely oh my God is that a mountain I thought so too as well but I realize it's too high oh I'm so confused is that a mountain or is that a cloud I've got a minute left now I cannot see me pulling this one out the back definitely not a perfect score that is out of the question I that is a Peruvian flat uh kit isn't it right okay hang on a minute so we would be in a nice area of Lima then [Music] really where's the nice area of I'm sure there's many but doesn't seem um I personally also thought that uh this could be um Gila first but because of the colors and the in the bus and and and things like that uh I also thought of the Peruvian Flag because I also saw some Peruvian color colors um but both of these I ruled out because of um the mountainous Terrain um uh his guest of Argentina and and Uruguay was was was really impressive just based on uh I guess the latitude and and how it looked like yeah I think it's simply the lack of information and when you play this game that's what you try to do you you you often you get used to it in a way that you will if you look long enough you will find some sort of a detail that will tell you what this place is the problem is this detail might be wrong it might be a flag in a distance that that tells you ah this is the place but it it might even be a flag of it of an empty he's he's letting his um his his search for Clues getting the best of him I don't know yet if he's gonna go with this he might just decide against it and go to Uruguay after all but just kind of to explain from my point of view to give some content of my own here why after mentioning even Argentina Uruguay which should be very close he's now in in Peru him like Peru no we can't be no now I'm going to Buenos Aires good job I'm going to Buenos Aires I just isn't that a River Plate shirt what am I on about good job people did I don't know where I'm going in good job not really near the center oh oh Tom it was Uruguay you were way better than I was uh you're uh intuition was right on the money so good to see you follow that oh my God video I tell you what that's not a bad switch that is not a bad switch why I was thinking Lima I do not know I'm so sorry anyway moving on so far no cuts no edits in the video and we're back in what has to be Europe that is so Europe is that Switzerland let's have a look no that is not Switzerland that is Sweden I reckon Maria praised God scatter can that be sweet sure it can be Sweden just have a look upwards we've got time right I'll tell you how we can rule out Norway oh there's a yellow number plate what is that is that just a Dutch person roaming the land roaming Europe willy-nilly I didn't notice the uh the plate uh I'm actually interested in hearing how he's going to rule out Norway in in my case um it's just the language uh I've actually I'm I'm quite impressed with his pronunciation of Swedish um it's not easy to tell apart Norwegian and and Swedish and to some extent Danish but since I am from Finland and I'm quite uh familiar with these languages I can usually do it not always it depends on on the words so I'm actually interested in hearing how does he uh figure that this is Sweden rather than Norway because I don't honestly have to do that I look at the language and I usually know if not then as you might have seen some of these jokes before I look around and if I don't see a flag then it's Sweden and if I see a flag then well it's Norway they they're always flying their flag somewhere I thought um definitely we're definitely in Scandinavia there aren't we let me just ah look at that that's like that is that a DK starting to think now that we could be in Denmark [Music] oh God all right well again they border each other so if I'm wrong I can't be too wrong but I am gonna go Copenhagen let's have a look in here okay I'm surprised to my mind the the name of the road uh is unequivocally uh Swedish I thought he would know that actually but um I guess not and um I didn't see that there would be a internet address on the car but the internet address of Sweden is SE DK would require two letters that are high and it didn't have high it was two low letters so the reason why I thought it wasn't so useful was because no for Norway and SE for Sweden uh look the same from this blurry distance but I'm very surprised he went for DK around here maybe I might as well change my guess you no bed you absolutely why did I think it was Denmark I thought I saw a BK it is in Denmark uh are slightly different this is all guys you those of you who are good at geoguessr you're going to have to just bear in mind that I literally haven't played in months uh it happens um it's sometimes it's pretty random why why you suddenly start thinking about something and then you get confused it's quite unfortunate of course because he was he was right there he he knew it was Sweden he pulled back from Lima because he realized it can't be Lima but here it's very difficult to say could this be Denmark based on on the buildings and everything so I think he was looking for some Clues and those Clues uh threw him off uh from the immediate right uh uh answer and that's that's a pretty big hit uh for him you can see in his reaction as well it's it's 1800 points lost even though they are neighboring countries the distance is quite big anyway fifth round the score isn't bad I okay this is Bangladesh anyway for the last one so Dakar uh It's gotta be hasn't it Hotel wool sit so he's thinking of Bangladesh immediately I think because um this is very typical for geoguessers um Bangladesh is in the street view Indies and sometimes one forgets what one is playing uh he's not playing the street view version he's playing the capitalist version so he probably has at this point forgotten that India is is here as well so the reason why he sees Indian text and goes Bangladesh immediately that's probably the the reason see let me just confirm I think it's someone called Annette has taken this here's a net confuse that play oh that's helpful how are your nails looking Annette focusing on the uh that you do in India you do get this same language but I don't think that would be in New Delhi so without any further ado as we approach the Midway point I'm gonna try and restore some I'm not going to find it in you uh I don't know why he doesn't think it could be in New Delhi um honestly don't uh so but again I don't know what's going to happen maybe he'll explain this maybe he'll retract this maybe he'll get to New Delhi at in the end he has still one and a half minutes I'm gonna click here just for now it's this is similar thing as last time wall City farm gate We're Not Gonna no 20 seconds left I'm really interested to hear what you're being Dakar but will be the other side of town I just why does he think it's takka I just know it I'm getting my hopes way down here we go this is it I haven't moved my my pin I'm leaving it you know I know the feeling man and I believe that man I don't 1495 points but that's brought my score right down we started so well that literally went that was like an exponential graph wasn't it we started perfect then we were 137 miles away then we were I don't know 700 miles away and then at the end there we were over a thousand miles away it just crumbles so it turns out that um I did in fact uh uh beat uh Geo wizard at the end he's get questionable choices in in rounds four and five uh were enough to offset my one horrible decision to to uh in in South America and it was the first time in fact that I have ever beaten him in any of this this play along videos so um it's quite possible that it is luck but it is also possible that um I have actually gotten a little bit better or maybe he has gotten worse because as he points out he hasn't been playing lately he had that weird Lima moment but he pulled back from that and uh and got uh I guess in some sense lucky but not really um with Buenos Aires um he knew the area he he saw from the way this uh fairly flat that the kind of area that that it was and uh it's a it's a reasonable guess it's a good guess and um yeah okay it was the wrong Capital but what can you do there's no information on that or if you found some information on that please let me know uh even watching his video there's nothing in that video he doesn't point out to anything there's no information that will point to the city and then the last one he was off almost uh one and a half thousand kilometers um that's a very unfortunate could obviously be much much worse you'd be like my guess yourself uh America but so that's the that's the result here so yeah let me know how that went for you did you beat us both uh did you find find this interesting uh did you find our ways of looking at things mine and and and Geo Wizards um different did we focus on different things thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed that uh let me know by clicking some of the buttons somewhere um whichever you find most drawn to and uh I'll see you next time thank you for watching did I say thank you for watching thank you for watching see you next time ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 42.50750563721501, "lng":
