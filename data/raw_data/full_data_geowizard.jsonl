"welcome back everyone right let's kick off this year's geo guessing bonanza from where we left off it's a diverse world 30 seconds per round with some of you will be pleased to hear a couple of minor tweaks the first off being the link to the game so that you can play a long okay and I will discuss that further in a sec just before we start because it's it's complicated it's not the perfect scenario the other one being yes I am allowed to move around and up and down the road which was kindly pointed out in huge numbers by you guys I don't know why I forgot that force of habit I would imagine let's go ahead and get these 30 seconds on the clock the score to beat is 17 7 5 7 now here is the actual URL for this game the one I'm about to play ok the links in the description also so if you want to play along as in before you watch the video of course then go ahead but it might ruin the video a little bit knowing where I'm gonna guess so it's up to you you could play it one round at a time so you don't know who's won until right at the end but you see it's still gonna tarnish the video somewhat so I'll leave it up to you for now and we'll play it by ear let's do this challenge in the mean time okay we've got a blurry forest good it's loaded that will help somewhat so yeah if I want to I can move down this road but I mean do I need to move those sometimes is it better just to study the place especially when it isn't loading for  ok I can't see a house down there now I'm going Finland for this one folks yeah I'm just gonna go here in Finland ok was Finland near to the Bourdon of Sweden though quite far quite considerably further north and where I clicked but 3 9 8 1 you know that that isn't terrible it's pretty good 260 1.9 miles you guys a lot of you will be beating me if you went for the north of Finland or the north of Sweden but it's early days it's a good platform to build on so on we go whoo-hoo this is exciting okay oh god I wish you would load quicker when I have my new internet guys this won't be a problem but my God look at this I don't know what to say about this where's the Sun where is he he's there so kind of in the southern hemisphere okay six seconds left I'm going for Thailand yeah there why have I click there oh wow that's why that's why that is so jammy okay we were actually in Lao and maybe that's why I click there is because I did have a round in Lao not so long ago I got a year an hour or so ago something like that and that swayed me not that it really looked like that but I don't know a stroke of luck seventy seven point four miles four six seven five points so who's beating me who's playing along round by round and who's beating me it's exciting if anyone's beating me then Fairplay but this could crumble at any any round any second I could get a zero score point you never know so we'll carry on then this is exciting I am excited personally for my own school and I'm sure some of you are too to see if you can beat me right now this is looking bit Russian / Ukrainian Sun firmly in the southern hemisphere I think I've just got to study I've got to put less emphasis I'm moving around although we do have a lorry yeah I think I've got to go for let's go for Russia but around here somewhere it was just a very poor road in Latvia as it happens near Bouska and near the border with Lithuania but yeah that did throw me off to be honest the the farmland and the surroundings looked a hell of a lot like Poland Lithuania that sort of thing I probably would have gone Poland if it weren't for the road it just looked like a Russian road the way that the concrete just kind of crumbles but three to nine nine points isn't terrible we weren't that far away I guess so yeah onwards and upwards I'm not gonna talk too much I think mainly cuz I'm just so excited to get from Rance around here we go here's the next one 11 955 is the score we are on we have a sign here who's going to make full advantage of this sign school zone what does that look like oh my god we have this one too I've got to be quick though I've got to be quick if it'll load that would be great I can't read it I've got to get closer this isn't gonna work is it okay I'm going South Korea I don't know one second left okay good oh my god I'm so relieved forty nine point three miles that's really good even by South Korean standards really frustrating how my imagery won't load it's just the internet speed I've got at the moment it will be rectified a promise in a couple of videos time but yeah that is that's a good one I think I just went on the green sign I'm not gonna sit here and lie and say that I understand the difference between the the symbols yet but looking at them the circles which I did see on that sign do seem to be a lot more prevalent in the South Korean thingamajig could have also looked at which road we were which side of the road we were on that would have helped why is the map different in North Korea it's really cool I like the way it looks it's actually harder to use a think but maybe that's just because I'm used to the other math but a last round guys I think yeah last round here we go concentrate concentrate it's Africa look at that afro blown in the wind can't stop to look though I've got to get this right I've got to do well here oh my god I'm thinking Kenya because it reminds me of those when they look at the rubbish in the tips where's the Sun I've got ten seconds son is there yeah I'm going Kenya get in there nice and quick let's go there near Nairobi make guess I can't wait any longer get in oh my word four nine one one points it was Kenya and it was near Nairobi in a place called well yeah it's Naro be and what did it for me was purely adverts where you see young kids in Kenya scouring the rubbish tips I couldn't really get my words out during the game but yes scouring those rubbish tips and quarries and places where rubbish is dumped and the poor kids they're scouring the place for you know any sort of salvageable stuff maybe even eating the food I don't know but um I don't even think we were at a waste tip to be honest but yet that's what did it and lo and behold that's where we were Nairobi I should have just clicked in the middle of Nairobi really I would have got an insane score not that that wasn't one view summary twenty one six five six well that's gonna take some beating isn't it on future games that's for sure but yeah job done and really pleased with my score just looking at some of those very lucky at times to be honest in terms of you guys who have played along let me know how the experience was and how you think we can improve it you know it's only January the fourth we're still in the early stages of this system that we're gonna get right but yeah give us your genius ideas as to how we can enhance this experience for everyone obviously it's never going to be perfect you guys can just play the map after you've watched my video and get a perfect score and you'll be top of the leaderboard so you know it's never going to be a perfect system in that sense unless geoguessr maybe come up with one themselves but it's just about you guys you honest guys out there getting the best that you can out of this experience so yeah give me your feedback hope you enjoyed the vid and there'll be lots more of these to come and as soon as my internet is ready more perfect scores more world city Wednesday's more home town roulette the lot so yeah until Monday folks take it easy and have a good weekend setup ", "locations":

urban world an urban world where a putrid thought much of the globe whether we like it or not though is covered by urban areas towns cities and I'm gonna explore them on this map made by mapper I believe but I think he's changed his name to have a go at this hint a Meister guy I don't know whether he actually does cheat I'm gonna stay out of that one but I'm gonna play this and I'm gonna play it no moving around I think yeah so I can I get confused with these terms I can scroll and zoom but I can't actually move my position why well I think - there might be some funny people lurking about so we can take the piss out of them and I think we'll just be able to use good clues and stuff that are around us it may take a while but you know there is potential to get good scores and when I say good scores I mean 22,000 plus potentially potentially so let's do it there's no time limit on this because we need that time to study our surroundings now just quickly while I do this still no good internet really sorry I'm not going to name and shame the provider yet but yet it means no home time roulette or world city Wednesday's on Wednesday it'll just be more of this so you know that might please some of you and the rest of you just shut up and be patient all right it's coming the Internet people are coming this week to fix the new Internet in the time being let's do this where are we gonna be how urban a world is mappers world in his little French head I ding ding ding and a ping ping ping we've got a pirate show here and that is one language that I could not tell you what that is is it's is that Hebrew yeah I don't know let's have a look around could be some sort of Lebanon script we will see well hopefully we will anyway but yeah this is different there's a lot going on here I've got a picture of a dog pooing here and it looks to be a red poo that has squeezed out of his little tight bum hole not entirely sure what the intended message is there but whatever it is surely it belongs in a veterinary leaflet not on the side of a road so we've had a Jewish pirate a very very ill dog okay are there any flags that's what I'm thinking at the moment and as I'm looking around it does it look he's Rayleigh I guess it could be just looks quite vast yeah definitely could be look at that it reminds me of the text you would get in Israel not that I've been we've got yeah we've got people so we can we can analyse the people here how do ish do they look that's the question how Jewish does this guy look well that's Ross from friends circa 1994 so what about these that could be a fresh Bank check that this older chap is clutching can't see the figure though so it's it's tough what have we got here Bank H a that could be Haifa couldn't it Maccabi Haifa what else have we got Jewish Pete's a guy okay yeah sure they exist eel at that is that is an Israeli thing isn't it definitely okay all right I'm gonna go for this where is a lat hang on a minute let's have a look at that Bank sat an AI F or is it a h AF I think if we're being honest with ourselves it's a HAF or even a H a P so a hi fer probably isn't where we are so look down here there's a lat so could we be here let's see could be couldn't we yeah he lat let's go for real up then yeah I thought it was an a for a minute right let's have a look we might even be able to do a bit better than just randomly guess well if that yeah I think the C is down there somewhere so I think I've got to be over here somewhere I am going to select where am I going to select that's the question I think I'm gonna go on this road here can you imagine here we go wait a minute we can do better we can do better than this so we go back yeah we've got the bank heavenly we can work this out guys we know we're looking eastwood over the sea we know that much could you be here can't see the bank there and there's no road that carries on prison no not quite we need a bank and now we're at the airport no I think we're probably down here but we're definitely not on that one and then if we move down further we're out of town we're out of it hmm could be further up here couldn't we could be further up here there's Bank apollon hey hang on a minute this is where we are isn't it we're here mate I'm going for it let's get as close as we possibly can we've got the edge of the building we have this is ridiculous there we go Wow three metres I do not believe it to be honest well done if you beat that oh wait you can't have done let's move on then Wow I said there was potential for good scores here I didn't think there would be a potential for a perfect score Xerox Rama Rama South that is Portuguese but we're probably not in Portugal because there's a hairy-chested Brazilian drug baron lurking in his doorway which is slightly too high for the path I think it's fair to say maybe he's got a fear of midgets breaking into his house stealing all his cocaine Oh God who else have we got got this wiseguy here with his shades and his shirt could also be a drug lord actually I'm not being very fair to Brazilians am I really okay we'll keep looking what are the cars saying that one isn't saying a lot that's feeling a bit sorry for itself to be honest I've got a Chevrolet I think we know we're in Brazil to be honest L entrada say daddy vehicle asprova door station are how are we going to find out where we are can this offer us anything a Lugo Salas are we in a place called a Lugo well let's look out for that word again so Tommy INGOs okay I presume that that's Sundays and Fridays something like that a Luger see it says there a Luger SAE hmm so are we in a place called Eluga that's what I'm wondering good luck finding it on the map but you know that could be where we are so yeah good luck what's that yeah I think I'm gonna spend a bit of time guys on the map trying to find a Luger just because I got off to such a good start now if that is SAE where was it a Luger se are there any states in Brazil that have se that could stand for se let's have a look si se no no no no no no no no no no Sal Paulo no Santa Catarina no no but we're definitely in Brazil Rio Grande do Sul no there's nothing here that could be SAE I don't think Oh I found one Sergey pay let's have a look in there let's look for a place called a Luger you never know you just never know I'll be very disappointed if I don't find it now but you know we're gonna give it a go and that's all we can do let's check the coastline shall we a Luger let's have a look here give me a minute please I think we're sufficiently zoomed here that we would see a Luger so if we can't find it at this altitude then I don't think it exists so don't forget guys that could mean something completely different that might not be a place so but SAE hmm special edition who knows agua Oh God that had me go in there where is the where is the edge of this state I think I've lost it there it is okay so I can't find it still can't find it in my head this is 80% a wild goose chase but I'm always the optimist so I'm looking anyway am I still in the right think no I think of I think I've moved over into the next one there to be honest I think this river is the border we'll have one more little luck over here SEC even the roads are named se that gives me more hope it really does please God let me find it come on Eluga the elusive Eluga come on Santa Lucia we've looked down here so it's getting desperate now the fact that the roads were called se spurred me on a bit but really really it's not looking too hopeful purely now because I haven't I just haven't found it and I think I would have found it by now you never know it could be a very small place that I would have had to have zoomed in on even more okay what do we do do you make it guess do I go into the main town here this one it might be a little area of this town Eluga come on Eluga okay right we're done I'm just going to click in this town then folks and here goes nothing I'm really really excited to see really curious rather I'm not excited cuz I think I've done [ __ ] I'm really curious to see where we actually were here we go oh man aha Recife so actually that ain't a bad score but um receive a interesting was Eluga the area I don't think he actually was was it that's crazy so what has that got to do with se or did that must have just meant something else they must have done but anyway that's quite lucky if we zoom out not terrible really not terrible so that might have been a huge stroke of luck a huge coincidence but we'll move on anyway okay third round looks like France judging by these little house numbers can we read this rue adore Anne I think it says what is that in there that my that may well be a nude artist classed a nude drawing class can you believe it look it is it is there's no way they would have those pictures up there if it was just a regular old classroom that is crazy who would have thought I would ever come across that I've seen it all now unbelievable and this guy's having it look he's undoing his trousers he actually is to her look he's just about to cross the road get his in fact what he is that I hope that's his thumb I hope to god that's his thumb we'll leave it there yeah we'll face the other way I think right see if there's any flags I'm pretty sure in flat flats France Oh goddamn all frosted okay we've got rue a Duran the infamous route a Duran what else have we got that is definitely French I don't think we're in Belgium I think guys we're just going to have a look have to look at the architecture and try and decipher whether this is just north or south if there were some football paraphernalia flags stickers that would help me what does that say Abe not sure but there's nothing really Esther put it away that reminds me of the side of Metz Cathedral the way that the road comes down because I've been to Metz but actually it kind of looks nothing like it as well but I am gonna go quite north in France so let's shut up and get in there yes that is indeed what she said okay so I'm thinking of going yeah Mel I go Mets or is that that would be bold I've mentioned it so much now I feel like I have to thing is with that though if it's over there I'm gonna get it pretty over there in breasts grow up guys then I'm gonna get a pretty poor score so what shall I do so I go lemons something like that lamal ruin do a play it safe ah yeah I think I'm gonna go Lamar Lamar Lemmons I'm gonna say I would damn well like here we go there's a cathedral here let's just go there even though the names are wrong here we go Leon Wow Leon annoyingly that would have been well it would have been about the same two Mets probably closer it didn't look that far south I have to be honest I spent a week in Leon actually so I'll be interested to know where that was up there was it fair enough I had a torrid time in Leon I ended up sleeping on a station platform I won't go into it but it ended up all right at the end three six seven five points correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that worse than my previous score of the last round surely not I guess that is pretty far isn't it that is pretty far anyway yeah I think most of you will have gone fairly north in France some of you will have just clicked in the middle and some of you have already watched the video and probably clicked in Leon naughty let's carry on well done if you're still up to my level at this point I'm sure a lot of you will be right what have we got here and you are trading what is this language men GL Baron parabot electronic okay what is that is that Malaysian or some sort of Filipino that's what I'm thinking so far Nizam seems to be a prolific figure around here getting his name down wherever he can Nizam I know it's of no consequence but you know what kind of name is that it's a Malaysian name I don't know I don't know why I'm asking myself write something for went for went eh sounds more Spanish could be Filipina ah here we go this could be of use troomph all equipment spare parts Sdn Bhd and there's like oriental looking symbols on there Sdn Bhd troomph I'll what are we thinking here I don't think they have that in the Philippines it's too Spanish influenced so I'm thinking thinking a lot of things and I'm saying I'm thinking a lot is that a flag that looks like it could be the malaysian flag so we'll carry on tom file i'm hoping is the city or place because then i can try and find it now she has got a muslim headscarf on so yeah they made muslim in malaysia nice am i should have known that does sound quite Islamic right let's um let's get over here then let's try and find because my other option is Indonesia now but I'm gonna no no it's not no they wouldn't have the oriental symbols what am I talking about let's have a look on the main bit of Malaysia the more populated bit and try and find this place this elusive tongued file true or is it true true pal whatever there's the border so trooll pal now Oh chump at not a million miles away hopefully trump our trump ah that's Singapore down there we'll leave that alone I wonder if we near Kuala lumper we could be couldn't we we could be in an area of Kuala Lumpur for all we know Trump all but a good luck finding it if it is okay I've had a quick scan over here can't really find anything at the moment I may have gone over it you guys may have seen it mm-hmm yeah that looks more countryside a to be honest what about down here this looks quite built up anybody know dust okay let's move over to this part of Malaysia how about that okay look at the names - they look more or less similar they look different to be honest they look more Indonesian I think they look that yeah more sort of pimping ping pong pong sort of thing I know thank you yeah very accurate I know yeah I'm tempted do we look over here I don't think we do do we no no no no no no I think we are on this somewhere so I think I'm gonna go for it what was that place tongue Pat so anything in that like is that there is that our name for thump I'll probably not okay I'm gonna have to click somewhere aren't I so I'm gonna go over here can we is there any clue as to where the sea is if the sea is nearby I don't think so what's that Malaysia I should have seen that earlier I mean it wouldn't have made a difference but so Kimmy Tyrion Cassie natin Malaysia they may not be places Sdn Bhd again look that's that's on there Sdn Bhd so they're different buildings they're different you know companies shops or establishments but they've still got the Sdn Bhd so what does that tell you what about the regions hmm definitely in Malaysia there aren't we these are the areas look Kelantan Barak about this one kadar Sdn Bhd what's this one doesn't say Oh yo ho yo ho your [ __ ] Sdn Bhd Sabah no I'm not going to go on that island I'm gonna go over here like I said I would I don't think there's anything else that can really sway it so I'm gonna go down here somewhere near Center Wang just for the sake of it here we go ah for pete's sake we were on this one in tau damn it all damn it all okay one 404 points that is shocking how can Malaysia spam that much area I don't know Oh God last round we've got to claw this back somehow to a respectable kind of 18,000 if we can right we've got big mountains in the background rue it Deschamps did tab back but are we in France yes we could be we could be by the Alps it's looking quite Alpine right Jedi Ron koalas okay said I Ron cross could be in Switzerland to be fair not ruling that out Gessler see that sounds quite German which could be Swiss it's bass province centre D something can't read it ha that seems to be a big bridge over there that is definitely a bridge sir we've got a river running through and a train track rod we hmm and there's a motorway there z.i aéroport what could that be said I let's have a look Zurich that be Zurich they are big mountains I have to say Zurich Airport but that would be in the German part so no I don't think so said I what does that mean general direction that could mean that couldn't it aéroport could that be Geneva's or basil's hmm could be Geneva couldn't it where's the airport in Geneva there it is for God this is tough only because I want to maintain I want to end on a high note I want to beat you [ __ ] all right you know I don't want anything average what's this over here it's all French there's no mistake in that I'm stuck I really am stuck here what can give it away what can possibly give this away I would love for there to be a dot France or a dot Switzerland website thingamajig I would love that but I don't think there is ah Airport Geneva hang on a minute if we can find ronk was then that will do it werenít Ron coifs could be over here these are big mountains Hubert Hubert and Ron coifs anywhere to be seen can't see him Airport have a look by um no there's no point looking by Zurich it's too German what do we do could be around here some money good to get an airport down here I'm looking for Ron Cross and Sint Hubert just because it's so mountainous over here there's Beaufort yeah what's the other place that's got an airport that's quite near to the Alps Grenoble that's it so could we be at Grenoble Airport hmm no I don't think so got to make a decision then okay so tempted to look for sin Hubert and ronk was got to go for a pic though I'm gonna go over here somewhere okay we weren't far my god we were in Switzerland over by sea on can't see ronk was or sent whatever it was anyway but I'm pretty damn happy with that because I think I've cracked the 18,000 that I was talking about let's view the summary yes easily and I don't think many people wear we'll have got quite as close as that so yeah I'm pleased overall guys that was pretty fun 1862 six was the score well done if you beat it without cheating of course some tough rounds there the Brazil one was tough that last one was quite tough the Malaysian one as well I think a lot of you will have also gone on this island yeah but well done if you beat me and tell us what you think of this format got a really good Sparkle quiz for you on Wednesday involving UK counties and on Friday it's another 30 seconds diverse wealthy to look forward to so tune in tell your friends share spread the word about this new

you get a quick format something like that fun formats whatever they may be we're going to finish things off with a diverse world 30 seconds per round and as usual I will put the link in the description so you can play along the same as last Friday so yippee right here we go let's start the challenge 30 seconds copy your beautiful little code I think I'll do well to be last week's score guys I think it's safe to say but you never know what we might get here we go upon this click of this button we will be away here we go some of you will have already done this round of course ok what cars have we got well can I have even have I even got time to look at the cars I don't know I can't even see what they are Nissan or [ __ ] Fiat another fear do we go Italy do I'll go Italy I've got 10 seconds yeah I'm gonna have to go Italy just because of all the Fiats Melania it's gonna be a [ __ ] guess oh wow no it's not whoa ok that's insane so we were in Modena 26.3 miles away that's that's crazy that's going insane guesses right yeah I don't know what I'm even looking at here I'm just kind of blown away four eight eight seven points Modena I went for belong yeah mainly because I had about two seconds left maybe even one and I just click click belong you because I've been there and it's a cool City yeah check it out if you're ever doing a tour of Italy but yeah Modena isn't that where they make Ferrari I don't know that might be wrong anyway well done if you be in that pool yeah I think we just gonna have to carry on and see if we can keep that up here we go I've got a climbed up a wall like that once to get to a service station right I can move of course which I forgot to do in the first round what does this say didn't need to move did I naeun okay that looks Japanese I was driving on the left or the right I don't think I'm gonna be able to find out yeah we're driving on the left so it's definitely Japan seven seconds I'm gonna go quite north here mountains okay my little change at the last second was pretty ineffective it wouldn't have mattered yeah that's the thing with Japan you can be so far away but to be honest I'm just grateful that I didn't go for the top island the North Island because I was thinking about it not sure why I think it was just the trees but clearly whatever I think about that is wrong so yeah we were down here in these mountains not too far from places like kobe kyoto nagoya yeah that that looks like a pretty wild joseph land down there with some pretty big old mountains looks beautiful three three four nine points it ain't great a lot of you will have beaten that because you will have gone for japan and you will have been sensible and gone in the middle right next round folks well done if you are beating me on those two rounds here we go here's the third mm-hmm okay we've got a couple of whippersnappers on this bike do I move do I move or do I just come on let's move and then we'll study this bit come on load Philippines okay good Philippines that's very useful to say the least I'm looking quickly for that no I'm going there here goes nothing yeah fairly far away I guess I was drew desperately looking for the place that I could see on the sign the place name I can't for the life of me remember what it was I guess or something have a look nope son Philippe but yeah at least I got the right city at least I thought to move I guess a lot of you will have two three four seven - yeah again it's it's okay it's okay grateful to get the right country yeah right fourth round guys again if you beat your meat well done it's gonna be tight I believe with some of us right LP 207 what is that is where's the Sun [ __ ] I don't know where the hell I am where is the Sun ah [ __ ] right above us LP is that a Spanish thing I don't know I don't think this is Spain is it I'm gonna mess this up I know it I'm going Spain of course of course if I had more time I may have worked that out an LP stands for la palma la palma which is one of the lesser known canary islands the more famous ones being Gran Canaria for to Ventura is that Tenerife Lanza Rossi and where's Tenerife then is that it anyway the other ones Tenerife and that one La Palma you just don't hear about but yeah I should have worked that out with the valve all Kanak kind of ground and sand and dirt but at least I click Spain I honestly think I had naught point two seconds to go there when I click that so and I clicks right in the middle as well nowhere near the sea which kind of proves how desperate I was okay we've got one more round to go daddy's a very poor school by the way I don't know why I'm so chirpy most of you well not most of you but a lot of you will be beating me so I've got to end on a high here I started on a high in Italy in Modena I've got to end in a high here we go oh jesus oh Jesus what are we thinking where's the Sun is that the Sun over there that's in the northern hemisphere I'm thinking Argentina then yes I'm gonna go Argentina how far north or we did you think okay I'm going up here how about that here goes nothing oh it's not bad daddy's ending on a high in my book definitely 155 miles north Ness and South nurse was excellent for three six seven getting you summary 17 8:47 nowhere near as good as the score last week but I think that was a bit of a freak score to be honest I'm very happy with that yeah the Italy one being the pick of the bunch the Argentine one being the second best I think then the Philippines I guess I've got to put that last but you know at least I went with Spain I think a lot of you might not have gone for Spain because you you know if you didn't get the the style of the sign right which is the only thing I went on the style of the sign with the lp then the number then obviously it looks nothing like Spain I think it looks more like Iceland to be honest than Spain and so a lot of you will have gone for some pretty wacky places there I think and that's fine I don't blame you it's only because I've been traveling Spain recently and and I've done a Spain perfect score that I know those signs yeah but I hope you enjoyed that one guys as always keep the feedback and keep your requests up to ya till next week guys see you later thanks for watching setup ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 44.63735486106101, "lng": 10.92864042785618}, {"round": 2, "lat": 34.4019999573212, "lng": 136.21334306453798}, {"round": 3, "lat": 15.06676586126429, "lng": 120.07003953442927}, {"round": 4, "lat": 28.46033698039987, "lng": -17.845315820589576}, {"round": 5, "lat": -34.80174836530148, "lng": -68.96984910268384}], "images_path": "images/LODKAx5BCJH9U14U"}

it going everyone we good happy Friday and uh it's play a long time it's fun time and uh I'm back on an urban world this is the second episode hope you enjoyed the first one it was no moving around which suits this uh map perfectly oh look he's changed his name back mappa so we know it was definitely him score to be 18626 that was achieved last week which was pretty good um in particular a couple of rounds in particular one round in Israel I got a perfect score so there is potential on this because of all the clues around you to get a perfect score um which is makes it really interesting all all be it a little longer um if you want to play around um if you want to play around if you want to play along even if you want to play around you can do that too just not both at the same time I beg you um no if you want to play along uh the link will be in the description best way to play because I haven't mentioned it um personally to you only in the description is to play the first round switch tabs watch me do it and vice versa keep repeat that process that's just the best way to do it cuz it doesn't spoil the video and it doesn't spoil the game that's it let's do this don't need to set a time limit just need to copy that but I must remember to paste that URL after the game that would be catastrophic right here we go again then let's see what Clues we have today is that a flag it is isn't it and it looks like it could be the Thailand one you know that one that represents Thailand um let's have a look at the people they're probably not the best clue to look at but I just like looking at them um okay Vita Rea not very thae things really ly is that Roman numerals or does it just say lindex I don't know is this okay here are some better Clues I think right retn Mia is playing that's funny oh years and years I thought that said tears and fears Gabrielle Nico who's that Mark Bo I don't know they're getting too small and insignificant I can't read the other ones um but Mia I remember one of you commented only about two days ago saying how can you be slating mere Paper Planes you know it is a fairly good tune to be fair I guess I just took a disliking to it when I was younger because it was always playing now what is this Norway Arctic race why was I thinking Thailand why was I I guess it was this thing here this is clearly not Thailand is it and uh if we look at the flag again okay in my defense is pretty furled up so this is can't believe I thought Norway was Thailand can we just can we just smooth over that okay is it going to give away where we are yes it is tromo 12th to 13th of August the month is irrelevant so this is this is definitely tromo okay we can get this we can get this spot on touch wood let's not jinx it let's get in the map though first pretty sure trumpo is very far north there it is look so we are looking across this Bay here um let's find there's the bridge I think that you can see there that's a very tall bridge I'm guessing so that ships can pass underneath it um now we are on a square we could be on this one let's look at the pattern in the middle yes I think you'll find that that is where we are you've even got the little render of that King Haron statue which funnily enough sounds a bit tie right Town Hall yes that's what I was uh hoping for that we were next to the town hall we can be we can afford to be pretty far off on this um you know 100 meters or so but let's not be let's try not to be I think we're about there 4.4 that'll do gives me peace of mind to know that we would have got the full points no matter what the strictness okay we're in Asia for our second round well done if you got full marks on the first round you'll be feeling very pleased for yourself pleased with yourself you'll also be thinking damn I thought geoga wizard might have screwed up there but no it was on a plate for us wasn't it really um okay we have tall buildings here in what could be a number of places of course I famously am completely unable to differentiate Japan with Taiwan Grande Mari see I don't think they would have no this isn't is this Japan look at the writing is that Japanese writing let's have a look let's have a quick look I think that looks more Japanese than any other one that I've seen but let's have a look at um uh South Korea Korea just quickly no it's South Korean isn't it I think Okay so we've got that kind of in our minds um if we could see a flag that would be fabulous are we driving on the left we are driving on the left I think or are we yeah we are now do they drive on the left in career I don't think that I know I think that I have known that but at the moment I don't think I do so I'm kind of back to square one um sugar me sugar me up I'm just no good with with Asian places man I'm hopeless I get all flued right we're going to have to look at this sign here and I'm going to look for some of these signs in Japan I think now that we are probably in Japan because I'm pretty sure I got mixed up with uh South Korea and Japan one time and loads of you commented saying dude they drive on the left in Japan you numbnut and I knew that and that's what was so annoying yeah this is looking Japanese now so um where do I go where do I go that is the question well let's look at the the the sort of F and stuff like that I do I go Tokyo do I play it safe lots of you will go Tokyo I think and play it safe that is playing it safe for a couple of reasons a it's right in the middle of Japan which is a long thin country and there's real potential for crap scores the other reason it's playing it safe is just CU well it's the capital it's the biggest most populated place um I'm always tempted to go for [ __ ] you okay um I am going to go now there's mountains over there I think so that is making me change my mind about going on the North Coast um oh here's an idea is this all built after 1960 I think it is uh after the after the the World War II I am going to go for Hiroshima why not why the freak not let's go for it where am I going I'm going there fingers crossed oh my God no way no way mate no way you are joking Not only was it Hiroshima it was two blocks away I do not believe that I fail to believe it people are going to be thinking I I I speak Japanese you know I don't but 366 yards 4999 points that's probably the most insane guess I've done isn't it it's one of them it's definitely one of them let's carry on I've got a wow oh God I'm GNA yeah right okay next one AO tickets tickets is that Spanish can I even concentrate on this round after that I don't even know I'm glad I didn't go up by that square bit of water um right par toos maras I think this is Spanish and not Brazilian um let's keep looking let's hope that there's a a decent clue I can't believe I've got 9999 points what the hell right Cito okay oh that looks a bit no it doesn't look Brazilian Portuguese no it doesn't as is perfectly common in the Spanish world right I'm just praying for somewhere that can give away where we are that's what I'm praying for that's what you're always praying for on this particular format a clue that's going to give it away although didn't seem to matter in the last round did it okay ano God everyone's going to think I've just somehow cheated there oh God okay come on give me a sign no nothing really that I can see that is giving this away shall I maybe I should just go into my usual mode of just judging it going with my heart um Del [Music] oriente where what kind of place loves motorbikes and that's annoying because I'm pretty sure that has some good info on it um right guys I think I've got to think about wrapping up here sorry if this is my making you giddy all this movement but I've got to just keep I can't leave any stone unturned really right what am I thinking I'm thinking Colombia is what I'm thinking um possibly you know Ecuador something like that is there anything flags have I looked for Flags H hell h could be arent could it be Argentina I guess it could be right I'm going to look up for Flags now just quickly we're spinning round again p pa a z laaz surely that's why you keep scanning around guys CU you might just miss something has that given this away is this laaz I'm just going to look for some potential Bolivian colors somewhere but that is the ticket well these are Bolivian covers colors covers uh yeah yellow red green they are the colors are they not um I'm I think I'm going to go for it I'm going to go for lapaz my God okay let's do this that'll be really misleading if uh if this isn't if that wasn't actually referring to lapaz but hey I've got no better option to go for and this could feasibly be Bolivia so let's do it um right let's get in there oh we've got mountains haven't we to quickly look at where were they mountains over there in the north so if we're in laaz we're on a on an edge of it that has mountains over to the north so what about about here how about here I'm going for it this corner here come on no man a I wanted to go for Colombia damn the bugger that put that up there on that roof why did you do that mate where is that thing it was to the South wasn't it pass there's nothing there's there's yeah not even a a hostile or anything called pass unless I'm looking at the wrong direction for [ __ ] sake 855 a woful score it is fair to say that has really put a uh a spanner in the works really well just a downer on it actually let's carry on though fraking hell at least I got that insane round in Japan um which is going straight on um thingy bob guesses right sorry I'm trying to concentrate partia delices okay well there we go we're in Ria laa not necessarily on that street though unless we can see a shop that says the same thing but it looks like we are in Ria can we get a road name doesn't look like we can at the moment but I'm looking North partika delicatess well Vis visalo visu I think that says can we see if that is this road I don't think it is no I don't think it is I can't really see but I don't think it is um we're going to have to try and go on some other stuff I'm spinning in circles again so it looks like we're on a main road with a tram line on it or at least uh you know a tram route uh there's a park over there which looks quite big if you look at how far the trees go on for um and down here we've got some pretty big buildings now Ria is Big it's not that big though so maybe we can maybe we can do this drogus also we might be able to although we can't read it we might be able to use that okay let's get to R now the coast is kind of to the north but we can't see that of course let's get in there and see if we can find this road it's not really a yeah the coast isn't you know it's not on the coast it's on the river so which side would we be on I think we are literally it is North slightly Northeast doesn't really correlate with much of the roads here so what about in the south over the river how about that could potentially be here no no no no couldn't be couldn't possibly be um I hope we are in reer and that that van hasn't traveled far and wide to get to where we are I doubt it now could we be here I wonder Whoops a Daisy nobody saw that therefore that did not count as moving let's see if we can pair this up that could be that which would put us drogus got it okay good we found it right we've got to get this well reasonably spot on where's this building I can hardly see it I'm going there I can't be yeah okay I've got the points next one last round I've got to end on a high here if I'm going to get a really outstanding score Capital certifiers what does that say doesn't say where it's based we've got English writing there of course render we've even got a website there dot can't read it cannot read it um okay we are driving on don't know yet the left driving on the left interesting so what are we thinking then about that is that does that mean we're in Australia could be couldn't it where's the sun I think the sun is is it over there or am I just wanting that to be the case no I right let's look at these Shadows it's very hard to yeah it's very hard to gauge these Shadows let's look at the tree trunks can we see any tree trunk Shadows I think they're right down the sun is right above us I think oh that's an interesting one are there any other Shadows oh yeah the yeah the sun is right above us to be fair um well to be honest that wouldn't really have much much consequence anyway because Australia and South Africa are both in the Southern Hemisphere and I'm pretty sure that's the only places we can be danger deep excavation can we see does that say Oz a there look I don't know Capital certifi does that mean we're in cber do we go Cur that's an interesting thought how green is CRA I'm going to have to go for this guys because there's no other Clues and the only clue I've got to go on is capital certifiers so I'm going to go for canra um I feel like this is the kind of place that mappa would put in but ultimately I'm at the mercy of the round here um yeah let's uh pick a road that is heading slightly that way is it curving it kind of is so let's go for this one then Captain Cook cresant no that's two it's a dual Carriage Way let's go Walker Cresent then can you imagine can you imagine if I repeat the feat that happened in the first round here we go oh my God I don't believe it 1.4 miles didn't quite top the first round but how could I ever I am amazed at that obviously I mean there's no way that that um Capital contractors wasn't relating to CRA absolutely no way so I you know I owe it all to that clue I wonder how many more of you also did that you know absolutely sure that it was Australia and then used the capital clue I would love to know um wow let's view the summary 2846 I expect that some of you will have beaten me in it's just this round Ain it that's boogered me over 800 points I got I mean yeah I yeah well done to anyone who beat me in the other rounds anyway is what I'm saying um 2846 well we smashed last week's score and set a new record for this particular format um but yeah these two rounds what can I say about this I think that that has to go down as just pure luck to be honest even when I was suggesting that all the buildings might be new post World War II I was quietly thinking to myself yeah what do you on about mate most City Center buildings are going to be new aren't they and then that happened chaos right all that's left to say I think is thanks so much for watching and playing along let me know how you guys did in the comments section I love reading through your comments to see how you did step by step it's really interesting to see how you guys have done and tell your friends let's get more people involved thanks guys till next time t ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 69.65148635974158, "lng": 18.955594467381047}, {"round": 2, "lat":

la tulips plus paperweights equals reasons right how we do in everyone it's another diverse world 30 seconds challenge one of the ones I think you guys love the most there's been some juicy one so far what was the best score it was in number two which was the last one and it was 20 1656 a pretty good score by all accounts and some pretty dramatic rounds let's see if we can emulate that in any way possible preferably beating the score but even more preferably getting some insane guesses rolled in there - what do I have to do what do I have to do okay I have to challenge my brain is like accounts of trespassers in my life oh I've just realized I've got a cough coming on and I may have gone mad okay no time limit no yes I do need a time limit 30 seconds hello there Roadrunner okay I haven't got Tourette's I promise I just like saying stupid stuff next next he next copy this put it in here there it is all ready for you there we go back onto it right guys are you ready to play along well you best do your round before you see me do it otherwise you'll ruin it you'll ruin it you're bloody rude don't go on my special patch you'll ruin it if anyone gets that reference I'm gonna I'm gonna mention you in my next video because that's that's a really obscure reference here we go okay I have a time limit I have to be quickly I can't dawdle so used to dawdling on an urban world what do we got oh okay look Scandinavian Swedish possibly please give me a flag give me a sign Oh big mountains Oh what do I go what do I go [ __ ] I've got eight seconds dude go Norway I'm going Norway can I get there in time I'm going about here boom okay we're Sweden it was Sweden it was in that zone where you know you know it's near the border because well yeah it looks Swedish in the sense that lots of vast forests and lakes and the kind of the road you know the signage etc etc looked Swedish but there was big Hills mountains even I'd go as far as to say there were mountains ah what a bold statement but yeah they were mounting so yeah you don't really get those along this side or anywhere else really I mean I might be wrong I haven't seen them it's mainly on the Norwegian straddling the Norwegian border so yeah three nine four four points well done if you're beating that I'm sure some of you will be it's two seven two point eight miles if any of you went a bit further north you know anything from I'll please give me a give me a break yeah if any of you went any further north than me up to out there you'll be winning but there's four more rounds to play children here we go next one ah whoo-hoo okay this is less recognizable Turkey perhaps is my first instinct we're driving on the right I don't know why I'm just thinking Turkey the car is a bit weird where's the Sun where's the Sun come in don't know can't say I've got to go for my instincts folks which is Taiki this can't be the southern hemisphere oh [ __ ] oh oh oh that was close in terms of time but terrible in terms of score we were in it Kyrgyzstan Kyrgyzstan I've probably had this country three times ever full stop and we were by this Lake I didn't realize we're by a lake if you do that one more time yeah daddy's but you know that looks like a country the more I see it looks like a country I really want to go to look at it it's just a mountainous I have a friend who's cycling he's cycling to Australia I'm gonna give him a mention Nick Raybould absolute beast he's set off from Britain and I think he's in Lao now already left a week ago just kidding he left about a year ago actually but this place the photos he had of this country were unbelievable I think oh no always it it might have been Tajikistan if so that was all completely pointless anyway what are we doing what are we doing seven one seven points crap let's carry on can we redeem is anyone did anyone get that country right son here is firmly in the southern hemisphere so what does that tell us we're in the northern hemisphere this could be Bulgaria Romania Oh God 10 seconds left I can't read that writing I am going [ __ ] I don't know I'm going mad I'm going Bulgaria that was close and that was close Wow time-wise that might have been nought point one seconds until I reached the end and I know that because I actually glanced at the time as I clicked and it was on zero for 72 for sixty five point two miles we were actually in Turkey that one was confusing me because the more I looked at it the more I thought well it looks like Spain or yeah Spain or Portugal possibly Greece but when I looked at the the people I'm pretty sure I did look at a couple of people they had sort of headdresses aren't whoops sorry sorry they had headdresses on and stuff like that and they looked either there wouldn't have been Romani gypsy but that's what I thought there may have been turns out they were Turkish which you don't really get the European side of Turkey do for 72 for well proud of that one dead chuffed with that one and stuff let's carry on to the fourth round ow God what is this this looks like Europe again Oh Martin so is this island I think this might be Island yep pretty sure he featured in father Ted right okay I'm going for Island then I've got it haven't I oh [ __ ] four seconds left oh my god Belgium oh my oh my Christ I thought that didn't look like Ireland again literally leaving it to the last point of a second the name totally threw me off Martin Martin I mean it could be Irish could be British turns out it was Belgian what was I thinking with that that as it turns out is a Belgian surname as well which does make sense doesn't it I'm pretty sure there's a cyclist possibly or maybe I've made him up to 903 points isn't embarrassing but the fact I've confused Belgium with Ireland certainly is last round can we redeem any any credibility here with 25 seconds left already bluebells to the right of us fir trees to the left and I haven't even processed any thoughts yet I think I'm gonna go Estonia I'm going Estonia and I don't give a [ __ ] what you say I'm going there I'm gonna leave it to the last minute again no way man no way oh four nine eight two that's a nice way to cup it off especially as I clicked in another place I clicked up where did I click originally I think it was over here was it and the only reason I clicked again was just for the sake of of the entertainment value of clicking in the very last note point one of a second I wouldn't have bothered I would have just left it if that wasn't the theme of the video a reoccurring theme oh my god that's what is that the most insane guess we've ever done it's one of them it's got Oh mate get out of town Wow well we certainly weren't in a town there on that last round and that's what makes that last guess so impressive 4.2 miles let's view the summary if any of you were like comfortably beating me there and then you started to play the last round and you like brilliant there's no way he can catch me now well think again I ended on 17 to 70 all of those apart from the Kyrgyzstan round were in Europe but all of them were a bit weird they weren't you regular European round so credit to mapper it is mapper isn't it yes he did make this I bloody well know it credit to mapper for putting in some you know not your average rounds I mean I did confuse Ireland for Belgium and thanks everyone for playing along well done if you've beaten me I'm sure some of you have this week again it will be impossible to know because of you cheats but I don't mind thanks for just being involved anyway and bumping those figures up on geoguessr apparently some of you have said that you've never seen so many people play a certain challenge before I think gee I guess I

Friday everyone welcome back to the channel as always an urban world no moving around video for you today which is fast becoming a favorite format for a lot of you and certainly mine at the moment this is it's up there at the moment but first just a massive thanks for all the astronomical support I've received for my upcoming adventure mission across Wales just hundreds of you that commented that I've never even seen you comment before just just telling me how excited you are about the trip it means so much it's made me more excited I'm also [ __ ] my pants a bit but you know it's gonna be amazing and yeah and just everyone who donated thank you so much and again apologies to all of those who couldn't donate a fiver or didn't have a credit debit or credit card I just don't plan things very well I just assumes that you could put anything in didn't check up on that but you know so sorry about that but hey I've reached the target I've shut off the donations because I don't need more it's got to 1,200 that will all be spent on gear okay you know cameras SD cards I've forgot about bloody ell I need at least half a terabyte of storage you know the list goes on so it will all be spent on the trip thanks everyone for your support again right let's try and be 20,000 846 points which is my record for this which i think is very beatable and I think that's a feat in itself that I've even remembered that score if you didn't already know guys you can play along to this game while you're watching the video the link to do so and the instructions will be in the description oh wait 20,000 879 I got it wrong classic okay what what am i doing no time limit I've got to copy that and I've got to paste it because knowing me I'll get the best score ever and then just forget to paste it and then copy something else so there we go it's pasted I'm in the zone let's go let's beat that score and beat you [ __ ] to ah here we are whistle pipes okay Pro mujer pro mujer that means woman in spaniel donde tu palabra Valley where are your words [ __ ] I don't know I I don't know in my defense I'm just guessing right let's have a look oh yes differently South America negro someone's written there in black paint yes well done we're in South America or look at these people they look Peruvian they do look Peruvian are they tourists they could be tourists from within Peru or or this could even be Bolivia to be fair so yeah let's have a look let's have a come on let's ever so look what we got here a lot of it a lot of it is unreadable you can't see it and it's hard to tell which words are kind of important which ones aren't is that a flag could that possibly be the bolivian flag there there's there's green and red I can't see any yellow because those are the colors green red and yellow others got there's got to be enough clues here come on I'm hoping for a website saying dot P P you I don't know PR we'll we'll know when we see it if we see it NASCAR okay what's that questio Quechua Aymara that's the brand that they use in what's the shop called decathlon that's the one yeah Quechua so yeah that might be a sort of a hiking trail in Peru possibly and I don't think this signs got too much going for it hmm let's keep looking that's a big bridge big bridge down there at first I thought it was flags but then I noticed yeah the cable stays the Andes are in the back almost positive it's the undies anything on these cars no it's all blurred out any flags there's a flag it's red yellow I can see red and yellow if it is a flag and possibly even a little hint of green at the bottom there so is there anything else gasps something oh it does look a bit like Allah Pass and I've never been there but I've been there once or twice on geoguessr and I mean once or twice and it does remind me of it so we could potentially be there what's that question thing is that no it wasn't there was it where was that then because I'm just wondering here we go question wish what a Mara I'm gonna get in there and because I think Peruvian people in Bolivian I think there's lots of similarities around here so I'm just going to go near the pass and look for this quest you were malarkey because I'm really not sure at the moment whether we might be in Bolivia or Peru the reason being the flags are quite indecisive they're quite inconclusive rather now this question what is it let's have a look Joshua Aymara I don't know if I can really locate anything like that I can't really see you know forget if I get in on these regions I could be here all day so I think guys I'm gonna have another couple of looks at these flags which were there that's not great to be honest this just you think you would see the yellow but you can't see any yellow anything on here no San Benito it says there San Benito let me look on some of the other car see if I can see San Benito that says Betty warns there is some sort of some sort of race going on isn't it look that's another that surely got to be another bolivian flag there which i missed the first time okay let me have one more look we get in there guys we're getting there we are def o--'s get in there now we are looking we are looking at Northwest up there which to be quite honest doesn't really make sense because you're looking at big mountains over there so at the moment that really doesn't really add up and unless it's these mountains here I'm so I'm thinking to find in a different place to be honest possibly this one Cochabamba possibly we have a quick look for san benito even though that was only on a car and he could have come quite a lot from quite a way away from here yeah we could be looking at a few places here guys to be fair I'm also kind of keeping half an eye out for Akhilesh you are but I think it's futile I think I've got to make a guess now so is not to be here all day but I'm not gonna go for the powers I don't think no way it could be we know wait yeah we're probably looking at these ones here so we probably are in the pass actually okay right now don't suppose we can get the name of this road can way from okay I mean I'm thinking of this road here at the moment no that can't be right it's got to be heading it's got to be heading in this direction so we're talking somewhere over here maybe this one and that is if we are indeed in La Paz oh there's a river yeah there's a river my god how did I forget about that okay looking for a river there now all of a sudden here's one it's not a big one there that's the problem ah shoot I'm starting to question the whole la paz thing now I really am I really really am okay give me two minutes two minutes and have a look at a couple of other options that one it can't be no River it's got to be a big river remember or has it I don't know have a quick look at this one now that looks more like it does doesn't it but the bridge doesn't correlate doesn't correlate at all I'm gonna keep looking Tasi know about this one Terry huh bridge doesn't know it doesn't really correlate or unless we're here yeah we could be there essentially I'm doing it I was potosi why didn't I look why didn't i zoom in what the hell no way there's no bridge around there what the hell is all that about there is no bridge the rivers down please do not do that there is no bridge that's really confusing look where with the bridge be over that's so weird one night that is a very weird one huh okay well the good news is I got one hundred and forty seven point six miles so that ain't too shabby really if you zoom out that's pretty damn good and yeah among the people who actually successfully identified Bolivia with the flags I think I'll be up there really but I don't see how anyone would arrive at that because that bridge just well even on that road I find that really strange that is really strange unless the bridge was like really far away and I just totally misjudged it right round two took a while it did but I think it was worth it for the points right what can we gather here clue wise everything seems to be frustratingly blurred at the moment he kind of okay okay I was kind of say it looks a bit like Finland but yeah we've got Russian right in but as I'm fast learning on these diverse world in urban worlds there's a lot of countries in which this kind of writing you can find I mean from Mongolia to Kyrgyzstan to Macedonia to Bulgaria you know probably with slight differences but really really very commonplace and as for land landmass well you can forget it okay more score side street now why would that be in English you wouldn't find that in Russia I don't think so more sky side street and he's weird let's keep looking there's a Russian flag so yeah we are in Russia it was hiding look in and amongst the untrimmed bush which is a great place to hide I have to say right is that leading down to the sea quite possibly the way that it's so blue down there you know why would that be sky if we're lookin DAP do not I mean that would have to be kind of horizon level therefore it would be water that's what I'm thinking these kind of buildings would back that up because they're more likely to be built kind of near the coast it's kind of to the south let's have a look just come round it's kind of south west really the sea is if it is indeed to see it could be a lake but I'm struggling to think where it could be looks quite European let me have a look because this could be I mean this whole coastline here would correlate with that it could be somewhere like Sochi let's have a look at this because it's quite a nice place Sochi so that is more ski side street wonder if we can actually get in there and try and find more ski because it's it's it's a railway station is it not something like that if I can't find it I think I will just go ahead and make my guess to be honest Sachi mmm more Scoy Oh oh no my ski I just found I'm just having a quick look along here Krasnodar I'm gonna go Sochi I think yeah let's get in there shall we and I'm fairly happy to go over here somewhere how about here probably wrong but hey that's not bad for 996 that's wait wait a minute that's that's incredible 1.1 kilometers we were over here I was just hovering my mouse above there as well which is even more mad I saw the art gallery there and I thought no we can't be by there but having thought about it that is that that is insane I didn't have any clue that we're in Sochi I just had an inkling that we were by the sea and I wasn't even sure about that I could just see a patch of blue that looked too low to be on a horizon level therefore had to be a body of water had a quick look at the compass so it was this kind of direction and just went for Sachi because I think there's a bit of money there I don't know yeah that really is one to remember let's continue we're doing quite well here I must say this looks like the other side of Russia let's have a look yeah well that's if it is Russia look at him I like it's nice here I like it my sister number five prostitute okay yeah that's my obligatory Borat impression we are of course in another country that has a Russian style writing oh that's snow god yeah that is snow with just like months of just car fumes and dirt on it really old Russian car question here is are we in Russia again or are we yeah now we've got we've got to be haven't we god these are so communist these buildings right let's see what we can try and find [ __ ] man we've got to be got to be up north far north well no not necessarily I take that back because I think the further you get over here it just becomes so cold because of the wind's coming down and I think it's more than feasible that this snow could last that long in a place like that [ __ ] man there's no there's no flags tell me it's definitely Russia and nothing to tell me about which city is theirs that up there that looks like English right in that unless it's just backwards it's being read from the other side now yeah I think I think it's probably the latter so it's really cold we know that it's most likely Russia how far north could it be there that's what I'm trying to figure out cellar mmm cellar dark I think that's an are you isn't it I don't know if only I could read any of these things I might stand a chance okay guys let me let me get in there and see if I can have a look where we might possibly be it looks different do you know I mean it looks different it looks like it could be Kazakhstan that's what's getting me if I can look at this cellar dot what almost looks like it says I don't know TR possibly you can't say TR Kahn it hmm have a look I'm just looking at some cities and see if that correlates with it what do I do here man because I could go quite far north in Russia but if I'm wrong it's a risky business points wise I might go here Irkutsk should I go there I want to get this right colors of these buildings are awful they really are oh man or I could go even further east what do the people look like some of them have got red hair more yellows and blues over there which is kind of Ukrainian looking I'm going here [ __ ] it that's what I said I'd do so I'll do it I've got nothing better so yeah oh my god now that really is far north I wouldn't want to walk that in a straight line I tell you Jesus wept for cooter that is I never thought it'd be that far north that is insane I mean that must be freezing absolutely freezing God okay well that has really put a dent in our score but it will soldier on yeah okay Oh God okay we do have signs that's just slightly a too much of an acute angle but I think we'll get this I think we'll get it there's bands what does list bands mean I can't remember those bands do Park okay let's keep looking around there's bands do Park yeah okay right well we may not have quite as much close as we thought hang on that's all the cars have yellow number plates at the front which you'd be forgiven for thinking is a strictly Netherlands thing but it's not Luxembourg also has this yellow number plates on the front as well as the back and they are the only two countries correct me if I'm wrong so this is Luxembourg because it sure as hell not the Netherlands so I think I'm gonna go into Luxembourg City the capital and I'm gonna take a look see if I can find any of these things right Liz bands do Park is apparently South Hospital de la ville okay there's bands to park I can't find any of this stuff at the moment so I look around where we might be rude la belle Voe what was the other one okay we didn't get another one so rue de la belve oh it looks like we might be bit out from the center perhaps over here maybe Bell vote no I think I'm just kind of rushing into it at the moment wait a minute lysee light gee I'm gonna call it Hubert Clements light chi robert schumann so does that mean school or what I thought I had something there but clearly I don't like she did garson's yeah okay so we need Hubert Clement if we're going to actually get this Liz Bands do Park doesn't bands mean something to do with water ah man so what could that possibly be then okay if I can't find anything soon I'm just gonna click in here somewhere and this is another city in Luxembourg it's quite big what could that possibly be this one could be this one couldn't it I don't think so though think we're oh my god like she Hubert Clement I found it oh my word this is insane okay this bands du Parc I don't even care Oh public swimming pool in the park that's what that will be so like she Hubert Clement is down there thataway so is the hospital now the hospital I presume is that one so Rudy belleve oh I found that can we see what the other road is or can we not I can't really there's nothing else I can really get I'm just gonna have to try and find this maybe this Mon so floor us could be down here to be fair although over here we have a bit of greenery don't we there's a church there so there yeah floors there we go we are on this corner my god 2.6 meters I'm well proud of that one that was a bold move to move from Luxembourg City into this place we should have never heard of H so Al's ette but it's paid off my god next one last round and if you're keeping up with me Fair Play well done right last round then guys and God what's he doing either he's homeless or he's got pretty bad fashion sense Edmonton and area child and family services region 6 so we are in Edmonton Canada I thought it looks a bit Canadian and over here what's that a hundred a hundred Avenue in the distance there we've got it looks like some sort of like you know buildings that have been symmetrically designed some sort of monuments well I think judging by the tall buildings around we're quite near the centre if I can just get in there and find a hundred Avenue then I should be good to go but if I can find out which road we're on now did it say I think it might have said on here ah nine nine three nine a hundred and seventh Street well that should bloody well do it shouldn't it one hundred and seven and a hundred F let's get into Edmonton there it is way up north in Canada and I think I've ever explored Edmonton but let's let's get into the center there's a hundred and two F is that it there's a hundred of Northwest so we're looking for 107 there we go 107 and a hundred there's this gap here that's visible to our left and yeah we're kind of by this bus stop actually mate so let's just click there 2.8 meters just shy of the last one by 20 centimeters and a 5,000 points view summary 1992 8 well I haven't beaten my best score but my god if it wasn't for that round we'd have been laughing let's go through those we had Bolivia to begin with which I was fairly pleased with despite taking my sweet time about it Sachi Wow I mean I don't know quite how I got that the Luxembourg one that was kind of a bit of detective work there the Russia one yeah well it's just a shame up it just gets so cold over here I mean I'm pretty sure Lake Baikal it's clusters Siberia and something I don't really understand because when you look north of there it's just so big how can Siberia be by Mongolia it's just and Mongolia as you've seen is so cold as well it's and dry yeah incredible stuff really yeah that was a thoroughly enjoyable game guys if you beat my score well done I presume that I'll be well it would have to be because you've clicked somewhere near here I mean North Russia wouldn't really cut the mustard it would have to be very close to there so well done if you've done that that's a really really good effort right another week done and dusted guys tell me what you want to see next week do you want to see me try and crack this perfect score in the UK and under you know 14 13 minutes do you want to see something different give me your ideas it will be a world city Wednesday on Wednesday so feel free to request cities for that I want big big cities though and yeah same for

everyone welcome back how we doing happy Friday dddd yeah it's an urban world the fourth episode an open world no moving around our favorite formula I'm sure we're all in agreeance about that the school to be is 28 to 6 achieved in Episode two don't before by this score down here 2008 I don't know when I did that I think I did that earlier and forgot to press challenge so I will make sure to do that this time so yeah without any further ado let's challenge and let's copy and by God let's paste okay here we go let's do it let's see what crops up this time and away we go on another urban world adventure I like the look of this building what does it say up here on this banner ah your new house town your new main town something something it's German okay that is definitely German which is good because we know we're in Germany don't we Baldy right okay so we know we're in Germany what do we got here button file a city nacked on 2nd of august 2008 my word that's a long time ago button button file city nacked now what okay is vattenfall is that the city I don't think it is we've got tall buildings there vasin file looks like the yet the company that's put this on so yeah and plus I've never heard of it so okay so there's that these look like you know student what you call it residential accommodation that's the one but I've just seen if there's any clue as to the city so we know we're in Germany just trying to get any clue for the city here have I been to this city at all does it look like somewhere I've been in real life not really so that's not really helping I don't think without far south though I think it's a bit further north maybe trees look a bit modern I know it does look quite quite sort of arid really the grass does anyway but that can just be a seasonal thing anyway so that is the only thing we've got this image of this city City night on the 2nd of August 2008 I just can't believe how old that billboard / imagery is does it say does that say Wuppertal probably not does it say the city here Nuremberg possibly I'll go Nuremberg that's the only thing there that something something new it probably says a completely different word in German but do you know what it's that blurry no one can read it it kind of correlates with the length of Nuremberg and it's not that far north not that far south so between you me it's a good strategic location to go so yeah let's go for Nuremberg and let's go well we're by a park aren't we let's be fair the park is to the south of us are there's no road by it let's go here are no road by that one either this is this is all just this is taking the piss let's go there after all this fuss it's gonna be miles away Berlin Oh Berlin okay never thought of that Berlin that's not an obvious selection some of you will have gone for that jammy bastard oh I'll just go for balloon no to be fair if you've got it right you've got it right you've done it that's it you know there's no one can peg you down three eight two three jammy gets three eight to three points isn't bad let's zoom out and look at the grand scheme of things here in Germany Nuremberg has carry on okay so we have been docked a few points there tab Beck's CAC okey all such Turkish I don't think it is here here work League bar that sounds more Dutch let's scan around buildings look pretty Dutch so it's a European affair so far we've got the yellow registration plates but I ain't gonna confuse the Netherlands with look sunberg again no sir was that in that was in ten country change wasn't it God what a mistake it to make her so whole Estrada yep who else Radha so that's good if we can get the name of the town city yeah we've got a few clues around here yeah I wonder if that's like a Turkish influence thing does remind me of the outskirts of Den Haag to be honest The Hague what does that say Gold Goldberg strata possibly so Goldberg and who else trot probably didn't say Goldberg food house company ok these cool dogs on the side of the road he's having a scratch he's actually measuring he's measuring without looking that's cheating anyone can get results that way so I'm gonna go dinner hog I think I'm just gonna go straight in Portuguese and Brazilian influence there so I think it's safe to say we're in a big city because you know we've got lots of different ethnicity sort of areas really or you know a lot of diversity more chance I think of being in a big city if we are in Rotterdam it's not the end of the world if we're in Amsterdam it's not the end of the world either so I'll go the hague because it did remind me of that so i will go where will i go i'll go there Kemp's draw even though that's the wrong street name what do I do that oh my god it was The Hague no way and also it was only a one kilometer away jesus wept okay Oh FK de Ojo FK de I was right down the road from it but I obviously wasn't gonna have too much of a scan for lack so I was just stubborn in the dark for nine five points that brings the average back up a bit well done if you sort of keeping up here because that's a good points all for two rounds let's carry on okay this is definitely not European justice Akbar pan Asia Bank Wow look at those squiggles they are particularly squiggly what is that we've got two types of squiggles let's call it writing language let's be fair the ladies here they look Indian or Bangladeshi but I don't know they could you know they even look a little bit Aborigine so maybe Papa New Guinea something like that we're gonna have to keep looking guaranteed reward of Rs 10,000 rupees use your nation's Trust Bank American Express card God okay American Express dot i k JK there's a K at the end of it I know that much what is something what I don't see what that would be LK I K I'm gonna have to keep looking around I think I'm missing a trick here I think I'm being quite stupid okay JK Indonesia Jakarta Sri Lanka it could be Sri Lanka couldn't it or could it okay katawa and Peter Lanka Ashok Leyland okay yeah I'm starting to think definitely Sri Lanka got there in the end they weren't Aborigine women that isn't an i k it is you see in sk ad okay that's throwing me off anyway let's get in the map think it Sri Lanka anyway it's going to Colombo and let's look for katawa and Petter even though we might not be in Colombo but there are very tall buildings here that's what's making we making me think that we are so katawa and pet Petter are they anywhere near they could be quite far away for all we know Jaffna there is another big city over this side isn't there I thought there was anyway candy yeah okay cata right I think we're in Colombo let's keep looking around just quickly my god this round has frazzled my brain a little bit so anything that says Colombo for us just this Akbar MW I presume that's kind of street or motorway or R is we five-star corner telecom Sri Lanka if I'd have just zoomed my eyes in a bit more at some of these clues I would have got that but nothing to say Colombo just yeah just one more thing yes so it's got to be hasn't it it's gotta be it's gotta be I'm gone I've got to go for it I can't I can't go anywhere else unless we are up here Jeff now I just know we're in the capital it's a big there's big buildings sorry but this is where we are how close can we get well well if that is the center those tall buildings there if they are the tallest buildings I'd be surprised if they weren't then they are down south south east slightly so oh god that doesn't make sense because the sea to the northwest but I think we can go up here somewhere can't we better market hey there we go katawa and Peter I think we can go up here clock tower is that where we are no I am going to click around here though yeah I'm I'm gonna go there okay a bit further south tall buildings were down here maybe that's where the cluster of the main skyscrapers is or maybe there are taller buildings to the north anyway we're only six points off a perfect score there so cannot complain but I think a lot of you will have you know at least equalled that but we've got two rounds to go here with the chance of a very high score very high score indeed and what is this young lady doing perfectly symmetrical isn't she apart from a slightly tilted head I think she might be measuring too um okay let's have a look here all right where's the Sun where's the Sun I think this might be Brazil where is the Sun well hard to say over there I think which is it's you know it's it's East put it that way I wouldn't like to say whether it is north or south hemisphere it looks slightly south which is confusing but that could be a seasonal thing not necessarily a strictly hemisphere reial thing if that's a word which it isn't so here we're looking at Mexico Colombia Brazil something like that something like that well you know thinking that is making me bolster the idea that we are indeed in the northern hemisphere because of the Sun Mexico perhaps I think I'm gonna go for Mexico can we see a flag you've got to be meticulous can we see any sort of flag you do sit Mexico is a country where you might see a flag and Mexican one as well so it is worth a look how Mexican does she look fairly but she also could be Colombian because she's a bit Dutch she might have a bit of black in her you know jeans which would be more likely to be Colombian it's more mixed-race this guy hard to say bit of a keV really keV I haven't used that word in years chaff would be the norm recent update but even that's about 15 years out of date Colombia or Mexico then what do i do what do I do I'm going Colombia I'm going with my heart it's a big risk because there is a loss at stake I'm gonna go up here card they're gonna gather up their gear now let's go there this is going to be wrong but I've got nothing to go on oh my god so far where you can't get further than that in Mexico Tijuana you cannot Oh in my head Oh at least if it's Mexico I'll still get about 2,000 points 100 50 points I got for that abysmal round we were right by San Diego in fact that's probably where several tunnels are actually built for young ladies like her and young men like him to enter San Diego in fact I think that's where that bloke was off to a freshly dug tunnel he looked like yeah you know he looked like he had a bit of urgency about him ah that's well for my score well  loads of you will have caught up with me there well done if you have to be fair but we've still got one round to go all's not lost still on 13 962 I can still get 18,000 and something it's not really the same though is it Turton erin marshland John Lang para legends Turton commercial real estate so USA yeah the American tradition someone pointed out on a video the other week there's always a damn flag USA flag it's always there in the USA Canada as well but to a lesser extent let devala okay yeah let's have a look can we get the city we need to we need to for dignity sake say we I do don't need your help you're doing fine without me so cars wise we've got a Volvo a Honda a lot of Japanese cars here so we could be over on the west coast Electric tattoos wine [Music] gelato panini the American tradition tattoo and piercing man oh man no definitive clues here mapa give me some definitive clues okay well I haven't gotten it I'm gonna have to look at the trees there's a palm tree there looks Oh blimey toyota prius toyota avensis could we be on the west coast Turton is that a place or is that the company I think that's the company because of the t-shi to me man okay I've got to go on the trees here I think it's West Coast isn't it I think it is okay I'm gonna have a quick look in California I know I don't know either terton is it on the coast somewhere down here this is desperate because it could be company name but it also could be a place name the company name being named after the place name that's what I'm desperately clinging on to Turton Turton mmm Sacramento Turlock Oh God Fresno Oh what do I do here F D F D la tavola okay oh my god thank God I saw that CA so it is California say thank God I saw that was already going for bloody California so it would have been useless G V w12 300 where would that be G V W I mean there is the Spanish influence there with latter volar GVW looking in los angeles again I thought I'd had enough of the place GVW Glendale Clint GVW I don't know what that could stand for could it be around here I just don't know I'm gonna have to go well no I'm not going don't worry I've got to make my guests first GVW I just can't think of what that would be right let's have one more look around I don't think this is Las Vegas I think it's further north so I'm gonna go up here to San Francisco and I am gonna go Torgo Oakland just like Oh Sacramento FD Fire Department potentially I'm going Fresno just because I'm feeling like a I'm going Fresno I was Sacramento which I was going to go for are you for 172 points what was the score okay we crested the 18,000 mark eighteen one three four let's face it the Columbia / Mexico round really really led us down there there's no two ways about it Sacramento that would have been such a good guess at the end there to sort of keep me in it and it has kept me in it in a sense but I think a lot of you will have surpassed my score their show full results there they are three eight two three four nine nine five what was that ah that was the hey guy can be proud of that one I can be proud of that one but it's kind of insignificant in a way because lots of you will have got a decent points Hall there especially if you went for Rotterdam and Amsterdam so that was impressive but kind of pointless I didn't do too well there on the Nuremberg round lots of you will have gone Berlin so yeah please comment with how you did what your thought process was how it compared to mine it gives me hours of pleasure maybe not hours but you know a fair bit of pleasure reading through them and be sure to like each of those comments as well and likewise like the video because it does well for the the stats and the algorithms that work deep inside of YouTube and yet just subscribe if you haven't already tell your friends and have a good weekend thanks for watching tada ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 52.50897301597525, "lng":

it going everyone welcome back to the channel and to world City Wednesdays and for the first time on the back of one of your requests I'm gonna play an Asian city map okay and to break me in if you like I'm gonna go with Hong Kong first as you can see I'm going with Hong Kong because you know there's a lot of English influence obviously we owned it for years and it's a very international City so basically I've got a better chance of understanding things and aside from this being the first Asian city that I've ever done there's also going to be another twist and that twist is going to be I'm gonna do five minutes per round and you guys are going to be able to play along the reason I'll be honest with you part of the reason I'm doing this is because I think it would just be so hard I don't I think for me to get a perfect score on this would probably take a while probably in excess of 40 minutes and I don't want to bore you like that so it's going to be a 25-minute feed and you guys have got the opportunity to beat me which I'm sure most of you will because I've just never played this kind of math so let's start the challenge funk me Newton's there we go and I'll copy the code and hopefully remember to paste it later will he remember ooh I hope so here we go then in Hong Kong or maybe not I think we're in looks like we're in the countryside here so yeah maybe the parameters for this game are a bit further out than I had have imagined put it that way but we're in between two likes and yeah not what I expected this is um yeah quite the opposite really I mean you can tell we're in Asia but apart from that no skyscrapers to be seen we are almost definitely on the verge on the edge here of probably the country that is Hong Kong and this is gonna be pretty hard to get already imagine this is gonna be a shot in the dark perhaps if it comes to it I don't know we'll see how we get on but I think less likely to get the English names out here out here in the sticks what is that I thought it was a sports stadium it's nothing of the sort so I'm kind of heading blindly here I don't know where this is crazy okay so we're going going south now let's get up the hill see if we can maybe get a few of things yes this is good this is good get a view of the see skyscrapers maybe three and a half minutes left ah we've got a road name as well name one road I'm gonna write that down in fact write most things down name one road because I think it's gonna be a lot of NIMS and nuns and pings and pongs and I want to do my best to remember them if I can't so it's not to get more muddled up right there's a bridge that's heading over that stretch of sea in the distance we have buildings look but I don't know the area too well so it might not be you know that might not be the center of Hong Kong it might be another area let's follow this coastal road quietly confident that we can find this just because of the sea and the landscape of things our guess so there's that bridge we have got definitely lots of tall buildings over there in the background again whether that's the center I'm not quite sure but it's definitely a lot of stuff going or not going on over there let's get in the map let's just check out the shape of it all because if we're looking over there we've got a bridge over there what did we write down there nom one name one so is that the bridge we're looking at no it's not because it's a big island in the middle and it's the wrong angle is that the bridge we were looking at possibly listen two minutes left now though that could be it no that's a tunnel that's a tunnel so it can't be that what else have we got could it be that then if it is then we would be over here somewhere that's an airport so I don't think we're over there so we've got to think again with one minute 20 left would we be over here that would mean we're looking over to Shenzhen which is China yes it is NIM one Road so that is still in Hong Kong and we are on a bit of the road that has really struggled the sea possibly this bit and it does bend to the left doesn't it look okay then what does it do then it bends to the right that perfectly correlates so I'm thinking we're on this part of the NIM one road let's go back so I've kind of forgotten how far we went oh yeah we went quite a while 30 seconds left here we had lakes didn't we but we haven't gone that far I've got lakes either side of us I can't see them happy fish farm so I can't see the lakes but I can see fish farm let's see if we can quickly have a road to our left yeah yeah let's go back again I've made my selections - the timer isn't an issue yeah I'm gonna go there who knows here we go oh my god four point two meters so we couldn't see the lakes either side they're not on the map but I've seen happy fish farm and yeah that's that's why I've clicked there I mean it seemed about the right distance Wow I can't believe that I was completely hopeless for that but helped out by the sea and the bridge next round well done if you've got perfect school there I have to say with you from Hong Kong or not something tells me I won't be able to replicate that to be honest but here we go I've got a big road above us can we get a street name sent no can't read that it's something theatre but there's no point trying to look at that let's carry on to the South okay we've got it anyway it's the cochon theatre don't think we're particularly in the center here I'm gonna go back to the street I just came from get a street name and here it is I think San Lao Street so I'm writing this down there we go son Lao Street cochon theatre yeah gotta write things down I think there's just no way I'm remembering it only takes a second to write it down doesn't it and a lifetime to remember these sorts of things for me anyway so we are heading north now and we've already spent a minute and a half or there there abouts so really we need to find out what this road is called this is by the way this is much close to what I imagined for Hong Kong I don't know whether this is very central though because I think skyscrapers are absolutely commonplace I think this this could well be you know a few miles out from what we would consider the financial center so I need to know about this road what the road is called where it's heading to preferably and we have a sign coming up three minutes left here we go then tow quiet one so this is the five and it's Junction three let's have a look for that already because it can't be that many roads come there so where's the five there it is where does it go from and - not that far away it goes right into the center so Junction three of the five it goes all the way around here - it's quite an integral road pops up everywhere so Junction 3 there it is look is that right Junction 3 yeah so we were cochon Road Park two minutes left always looking at the clock so I think we were down here somewhere San Lao Street that rings a bell yes that is the one that we started on Wow okay back we go so yeah we are here I can I can pretty safely go there unless I've gone badly wrong excellent five meters wow this is a great start this is easier than I thought it'd be I thought it would be really tricky right I still a third round then all could go tits up from here believe me and that is a smart comb-over but we haven't got time to it's not a comb-over is it's a parting it's unfair to call it a comb-over that would imply is balding which he is to a degree but not to the extent that warrants the phrase comb-over I should probably concentrate on the round because this is this is why I  up cuz I get complacent okay now what have we just done there then oh yes we're by the sea again yes that always helps do we have this road name we don't but if we can get this one Kwok man road again writing it down Kwok man what's he doing what are they doing picking up paper or scrubbing the floor I don't know right Kwok man Road right I'm truly fascinated by this no person riding a bicycle or tricycle on a road she'll carry another person fine 2,000 pounds so you can't do a Bucky you can't have a backing out here that is for absolute certain and I have spent a lot of time messing around here okay people parasailing we're on a beach now we need to look here ancient rock carving tongue Wan Beach writing that down as well tongue Wan beach and then knock Kwok man Road oh my God look at this map how didn't I see that got a look at this right welcome to Cheung Chau well this is it Cheung Chau I mean I don't even need to write that down I'm gonna get in there on the map I'm gonna use the compass we're on the eastern side of the island where is it Cheung Chau could it be as far south as some of these do you know what I'm gonna look at the shape of it again keep it fresh in my head can't see it yeah can't see it yeah and there are lots of islands davidís can see it a mile off Cheung Chau Tong one beach and we've got to find Tong Wan Road was that it knows it was right here where is it Rockman road I think we further appear possibly this one oh Kwok man rode his god that doesn't really add up I'm gonna get onto this promenade and look down the beach again okay we're kind of in the middle but further up here right I don't think we can be up there bellavista block this is worrying now this could be it but there's no road where I've just come from let's try the next one down windsurfing memorial garden what happened to windsurfing then did it die there's the garden look I presume windsurfing memorial garden yeah I'm guessing that's it so yeah we must be unfortunately up here somewhere oh boy okay I think we can do this if we count the houses anyways again mr. side parting and which way did I go I think I went south but I'm gonna head this way now okay I'm gonna go back the other way we're talking about buildings there's a gap there are the buildings even on that they are aren't they so we could be there let's head to the end Oh God we went right down here I presume and we got to here so yeah it's not on the map but having just gone down this whole road I think we can safely say that we we are there because yeah there's no there's no road in perpendicular to the other road yeah and that is an angle so I'm just gonna let the clock run I'm gonna say we are there here we go 14 meters but we've just got the points I can't see how we would be there I think that's wrong I genuinely do unless I'm totally I've got mixed up but if we were in that gap obviously we were on this side of it but we've got the points amazingly I'm chuffed and quite shocked at the same time okay let's keep this up we're on a perfect score here we've got two rounds to go right still think I'm floating on luck here I really do okay well what am i doing where do I go here this is a mad little bit I can't go that way so I've got to go down this way yeah okay here we go then Karthus this is strange this might be hard to get as well I can't go down there either no I can't I've got to go up here I hope to god this isn't like a closed-off square because if so on I'm absolutely buggered is that the C no it's too high up to be the C isn't it I think now where can I go does feel like I'm very restricted here he's that the C no it's it's no I don't think it was ty on Terrace write that down ty on it's all I need to write down can I get down yes so I can escape down onto this road can i sure a per station street yes I can go down here okay that's good up a station Street however we've got a long way to go here I think kings college old boys association primary school right I don't think I need to write that down King's College upper station Street let's look for more clues keep going south all right presume we're quite near the financial center but I don't know can we read any of this Museum of medical science Tong hua hospital saw they're all good clues okay that's over egged it there a bit what is this Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences Cane Lane tempted to go into the the main map to be honest I might do it mmm-hmm let's have a look might look for Cane Lane oh god this is risky this is very risky I think we'll be down here somewhere I'm kind of looking for a million things at the same time how close to the center could we be ah what's that Hong Kong Museum of History damn Hong Kong Science Museum okay right and we've just gone from this direction one minute 42 left what can I find that school Hong Kong Science Museum I'm looking for station Street now combined with the school finding schools but not that school God almost a minute left now slightly worrying which way is the museum it is kind of to the south actually I should be looking more to the north so up here somewhere god I don't think I'm going to get this one right at all I don't think that's even right you know I think that's a different museum could we possibly be down here this could be a complete waste of time 20 seconds and I could well be on the wrong side here back up we go  okay I will go near to the Science Museum then where was it where was it okay I'll go up here somewhere man aah I'll know it was in the South so Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences is where we were and our run comes to an end where's cane line then it doesn't matter oh dear okay two nine seven Oh points hopefully I'll still be beating many of you but I think some of you Hong Kong heads or just better adept players to the east will be beating me you will have overtaken me last round can we end on a perfect score here well maybe this looks like a decent round hmm tryna make a decision here which way to go the Hong Kong Polytechnic University didn't I just see that didn't I just see that over here just north of that Science Museum Hong Kong Polytechnic University there it is okay aha right so I'm looking north here can I see the shape of that building could be that couldn't it could be could not be I think it is you know looking at it yeah it is I think that correlates perfectly also we're on the main road here but there is a slip road err of sorts that's just the bus station which kind of correlates is this where we started no we're right by this bridge is there a bridge yes but it's more of a footbridge so I think we can go there I think we're there unless again unless I've got this spectacularly wrong I think it's gotta be it's gotta be I'm doing it I've got a broke it nor point eight meters and a good old five thousand points to cap it off view summary so apart from that one round I've done all right to two nine seven oh well yeah par from that one round it was all perfect in actual fact guys well done if you've beat my score and I hope you enjoyed that Hong Kong slightly different version of World City Wednesday's I really do it's been great to add a an Asian City in there please request others although I might not be quite successful if I'm in Tokyo or Busan as one of you suggested last week but yeah I will do more Asian cities basically is what I'm trying to say please keep the request come in for well City Wednesday's although next week it will be hometown roulette just so you know and stay tuned for Friday for another play along game and also look out for the edited video of me crossing certain Park yes that's coming too before I do my trip in March that's all take care

"welcome back everyone hope you're enjoying this lovely Friday looking forward to the weekend but for now it's an urban Bloody ell and you broke my computer desk calm down calm down it's an urban world no moving our favorite episode 5 the score to beat is 20,000 8 to 6 as usual achieved I think on the second episode we've got to beat that now it's getting silly we've got to beat that and it's perfectly doable let's press challenge and let's give this a go here is the URL that you will be using to play along paste and let's do it ok let's get in the zone here we go we've got snow on the ground but it looks it looks Japanese at first glance can't see the sky for all the wires yeah the guitar the guitars the guitars really mate trying to wake up the cars definitely look in Japanese we've got a die at Zoo or is that a Subaru van I've never seen a Subaru van or is it a high end I can't tell I think it's a die at Hsu here we go here's all the script Sarah again healing your life Wow you've sold it you've sold it to me yeah it's looking G well it's looking quite blocky ah we've got circles okay this could be yeah this could be career then I think it almost definitely is making that a high on die possibly yeah okay let's have a look we're in a fairly big city here would have thought definitely Korean definitely Korean as as if to think I would have been confused by that before ye lot pointed out that the circles were only in Korean embarrassing really that he's a church that's a Christian Church right there so maybe that'll be on the map if somehow we figure out what city we're in it's gonna be hard to do that very hard to do that without somehow stomach stumbling across a sign that we think alludes to the city which I doubt I mean this could did this could possibly have it let's get in there and have a quick look the blessing is with South Korea compared to Japan it's all in one place it's one big blocky square shape really see you're never too far away whether you're in Busan or soul or Incheon Daegu whereas Japan is a right bugger with all respect so can I look at any of these places they're quite short name they're all short aren't they and so there should be really the amount of different symbols they have so they bloody should be can we look and on anything any any of these I'm just kind of I'm I'm just delving into silly territory but it's worth a look in fact I think I should go north seeing as we're in the snow and I think of I've also realized that that ain't gonna happen I'm not going to find out which city we are in from looking at signs I don't think maybe it's possible but it could could well take five or ten minutes or more so I'll go for a northern city and I will go where shall I go some of these places big I can't see any mountains can we see any mountains can't see any at all what about that in the distance no that's just a wire going across there should have known really okay I'm gonna go for Incheon I think it's fairly far north I don't I don't know if that's if the North nurse is going to make too much impact on the snow but I think it increases our chances if anything maybe slightly so taller buildings are to the south let's go yeah let's go here okay so we were actually in dayz on which I've said incredibly French which probably isn't the right pronunciation is probably danger on of something like that koreans let me know just how that actually was four five one eight points he's a lovely little score to feast your eyes on eighty eight point three miles i think i'd be hard push to beat that every round but we'll see if i can't achieve that kind of score every round that will be a dream and that will give me a score that will be hard to beat well done if you guessed anywhere nearer than that I think if you went Daegu I think you would have done but I think lots of you will have had the similar idea to me to go north cuz of the snow let's move on okay this looks a bit more American doesn't it look at Hank here just locked his car she's going a Boston sports club he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't work out he just kind of buys a beer and sits on the side and reads the newspaper Boston's oh we're okay we're in Boston okay Boston sports club that's ridiculous she's too busy making a joke didn't realize that I was glaringly obvious clue was right there in front of me and I even said it so Boston sports club yeah okay right there's some tall buildings in Boston they're just to the south do you know what I think we can go in there ah this is going to be heartbreaking if this isn't Boston for some reason okay let's get in there Oh God where is it there it is Boston right downtown is in this general area I think it's safe to say can we find Boston sports club I don't see why we can't but at the moment I can't come and get a street name is that too much to ask or this bank perhaps Webster bank Webster bank can't read that name reserved for Boston police that just backs up that we are indeed in Boston that's kind of relieving so yeah it's just Boston sports club really that we need to look out for and it is definitely to the north of most of the stuff there's some tall buildings there maybe if we go up here Boston Massacre site was that thee was that the Marathon thing I would have thought so Boston sports club then is what we're looking for Hard Rock Cafe the Bostonian Boston so I've just learned that basta Bostonians are called Bostonians probably would have guessed that to be fair Bostonians make sense but can't find the sports club at the moment not at the moment gotta get it there I want to get the you know only get the best score we possibly can downtown Harvard Club of Boston yeah not getting it click Boston sports club got it finally so buff bullfinch fully said buff clinch that would have been a really nice word Bulfinch place okay I think we're there I think we're almost definitely there there's the little alleyway that leads to Hawkins and we are there let's do it oh my god we weren't there forty nine point four meters I've got the points was the next it was the next one that was buff Bulfinch place was that little alleyway got that all wrong and if I'd have actually just studied it I would have seen that that was the police station and that was the Sports Club nevermind I've got the points I would have been fuming if I didn't but I did let's carry on really good score at the moment Great Western Bank can't read that but we'll keep looking round this looks like a Medicare again quite an old church down there but I still think it's America what is this then Mackenzie River Mackenzie River now isn't that in Canada the Mackenzie River I'm not sure Maine Avenue boys law firms some of you will know this I don't think this is a big city 11th Street but some of you will know it and we've got it it's sweet I mean I'm gonna get lambasted whichever way I say this but is it's you or Sioux Falls sweetles Cu Spall's Oh God okay welcome to downtown sweet Falls I'm gonna call it which I know is wrong so shut your traps let's find it which state is that in the Mackenzie River there it is I've got it I thought I'd recognize it it's probably from that the countless times that I've zoomed into Nebraska and Dakota and Iowa if I'm stuck in the middle of a cornfield so we've got we've got Sioux City and Sioux Falls I'd love to know how this is spelt can someone spell it out phonetically please was it Sioux Falls pretty sure it was but just check yeah it was so 11th Street and Main Avenue it's all set up for us on a plate here if you don't get this you you know you're a bit of a thick e really let's be honest so ninth Street a laughs I got it wrong 1413 11th and this surely is Maine it's not Minnesota Avenue so where is Main Avenue then I fail to believe no I fell to believe that that isn't it I think we're here Bank Midwest Mackenzie River is that there I can't see it where's snorts barbecue I can't see that either unless it's down here oh dear okay not to worry we'll get there we'll get there Midwest Bank no it's not Midwest Bank but I'm sure I saw that Great Western Bank right let's keep looking for a Main Street then because unless that's 11th Street and then we've got ya West 11th Street there Main Avenue guard it Mackenzie River Boyce law firm boom go back to the oh no we don't need to go back to the start we haven't moved yeah we're just about on the south side of this Junction they're four point seven meters what no that's fine that's okay yeah we weren't there but yeah okay five thousand points yeah this is going really well I just hope it doesn't fall to pieces Taleb building football Kenya Federation South Coast branch bloody hell the clues in this game that have befell us befallen us are absolutely brilliant the Automobile Association of Kenya lots of things lots of things based in this building the national football team the Automobile Club my pens II Cassie I think we can get the town here can't we Dola is that the town let's have a look at the south coast of Kenya okay Mombasa would be the probable choice wouldn't it but let's keep looking let's look for clues that say Mombasa I think hopefully we'll get one because it's got to be a major city Mombasa sweet Mart there we go now the question is can we get a street name we've got the diamond Trust Bank yomo can get a branch is that an area of Mombasa let's get in there that's all on this island look let's have a look a little but discovered Oh beloved mama ma kakaka let's look for Jomo Kenyatta as a possible area you never know Mombasa oh is that the name of the guy who runs it could well be I think we can do better than that clues wise doesn't say the street name there come on what else have we got else do we have we're on a very Main Street arm way to be fair heading kind of south is it possible to get a street name hmm not by the looks of things let's see if we can get in here find a Main Street could be this one look I reckon it's this one we've got a total petrol station so there's a shell oh I thought that football club no it's just my cooley foggy air club whatever that is won't ask okay and then we're out so remember we could be on another road could be on this one let's see could we be further down yomo Kenyetta wait a minute yomo Kenyetta where did i just see that it's gone now it's bloody gone there it is kcb yo mo Kenyetta Avenue so this is the road this is definitely the road question is can I find he's definitely not down there we're on the straight bit so we're up here somewhere could it be that that shell garage transformed into a total garage quite possibly Boston leisure we're back in Boston now I am confused yeah so we're looking out for a couple of things really put a total garage our Libya could be that look Saba Saba or Libya I don't know haven't seen a total garage that's the main confusing thing okay okay I'm looking on the wrong side of the road that might be why am i no I'm not I'm not okay rentokil right and then we're up to it a roundabout can I see that roundabout at all I can't be honest I think we I think we're further down here right can I see Barclays or dtb which is another Bank apparently so dtb Barclays DTB Barclays if not I'm just going to click on the street somewhere total can yet Avenue got yeah diamond Trust Bank here we go there's Barclays it's in that building yeah Barclays is also in this talib building which we are right next to I'm gonna say we are there seven point six meters that'll do nicely Wow what again this is nineteen five one eight points okay we haven't beat the record in four rounds but we almost have and if we get a strong round here which remains to be seen but it looks like we're in Europe then we will almost definitely be a score let's look for any clues that we possibly can here so cars let's have a look at the cars what are we got here we've got a Volkswagen Polo which could do with a little bit of TLC we've got an Audi the one next to us there looks like it's a boy is it a Citroen Saxo something like that not sure Peugeot 306 something like that French then and then we've got a Mercedes a Citroen brand spanking new Citroen a Fiat no that's an opal or Vauxhall for you English people got a girl over there I didn't notice her she's oh she's being serenaded by this man look this young man please I want your back no get out of my life Lorenzo okay not saying we're in Italy but that possibly looks like a Mazda that is just a shitty Ford the new Focus is it God the designs have gone down the pan and that is a BMW so all in all a bit of a mix I would say we're not in France not only because of the shapes of the buildings kind of but also too many German cars that has writing on it but I can't read it but you don't I think that's more German you know so this could be Belgium it could be could be Luxembourg to be honest knowing mapper he likes to throw a lot of looks and bugs in so yeah we've got to make a decision now we've absorbed all of the information that we can I think yeah I think I think I'm inclined to go for Germany here or Luxembourg I might go for Luxembourg I feel like they're more likely to have German cars in Luxembourg yeah but it could be Germany could well be Germany is there anything that can give this away they look quite I don't know what they look it's gonna say a bit darker in complexion could still be German okay it's at anything else is there a Germany balloon that's got caught in the trees and never mind unlucky so yeah I'm gonna go for Luxembourg and if I'm right hurrah if I'm wrong at least I'm near to Germany and a lot of the places around here wouldn't be too far away from where I've clicked it's it's some of these buildings that don't look very German to be honest like this whole row doesn't look that German the church it looks Belgian or or Luxembourg so that's what I'm gonna go for I'm gonna go for and zoom out a bit I mean Luxembourg City here or we further over to one of these places how about here let's go here here we go oh my god it was France my word so just an abnormal concentration of French cars yeah I knew there was something about the buildings that didn't look German just went with the odds really Lahav which is where you get the ferry to from Southampton 284 miles a bit disappointed with that round but let's view the summer 8 because we've done it 23,000 126 point that's a really nice number and what it is about that number maybe it's just the victory that oozes from it but we got South Korea Kenya didn't get France but we did successfully get Boston and sweet see you Falls I think I was helped out there buy some decent clues and some pretty handy rounds there that kind of handed it to me and I think a lot of you despite me smashing my record will have beaten that I think you will have beaten that score some of you that that perhaps went further into France and I think some of you may have even beat my career score too so well done anyone who's beat me I will wholeheartedly believe you if you comment with your the story of your game I love reading through those but honest people only good nice honest people only respectful people ok yep honestly well done and thanks for watching thanks for playing along as always let me if you want to see more of this series I toyed with the idea of doing an urban world no moving scrolling or zooming okay I think it'd be pretty tough to resist the temptation to scroll around but yeah that might be a fun one to do and it might be a fun thing for you guys to play along with because we've never done that together yeah take it easy guys have a great weekend and I'll see you on Monday tada ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 36.32545035632451, "lng": 127.39912388420476}, {"round": 2, "lat": 42.36121420235874, "lng": -71.06093611902406}, {"round": 3, "lat":

"welcome back everyone how we doing hope you've had a fantastic Monday and you were watching another and I say another it's been so long since I've done this famous places I did episode 1 and 2 all those months probably over a year back to be honest I'm pretty [ __ ] at it but there's a lot of famous places it turns out that I don't really know where they are and that's even if I've heard of them so yeah it does take a different kind of knowledge let me just quickly fill you in on the week ahead if you like or the few days ahead I leave on Thursday terrifyingly enough to mission across Wales I spent yesterday doing a bit of prep work in Wales and let me tell you it's looking a bit daunting there's a few swollen rivers and snowy hillsides and very high hedgerows that I've got to contend with some [ __ ] myself a bit but very excited also I'm not going to have chance to do your usual couple of weeks of geoguessr okay I'm gonna walk out as many videos as I can today but they're gonna be I'm not gonna be able to do your longer videos you-you-you ones that take a lot of effort and guile it's just gonna be more fun things like this so today it's famous places you guys can play along which is great because you've we've never done that before so I'll click challenge no time limit although although I'll try and keep it as snappy as possible the other thing is which is bad news is I haven't had chance and I really haven't had a chance to edit the practice run I did across certain Park I know but I will be able to edit that when I get back if I get back in one piece from my trip so let me copy of a copy dirt I presume so cuz it's highlighted will get on here that's one that I just did and it was [ __ ] so we'll copy that so we remember it afterwards and let's play this what famous places will we get we've got some heads n PS vehicles only what is that lots of USA flags I'm always going on about the fact that you always see a USA flag you're in the USA obviously to be taken with a pinch of salt but this time it definitely does apply there that looks huge I mean it really does we've got a crane there which looks pretty big and this is dwarfing the crane although it might be a bit further away let's let's move around and look at the people we've got various ethnic minorities here survey survey lodge ranger station National Park Service okay that's throwing a spanner in the works because if this is a national park okay we are in a city which is reassuring because I thought that was the is it the Washington this is what I mean I'm really not good at this sort of thing there's a monument in Washington isn't there and it's like a big needle and I'm wondering if that is it can I see and he's announcing in the background the White House is that the White House could that be the White House maybe we can use the compass to have a look let's look at these buses they could be from all over although they are all white yeah I'm gonna go into Washington because I've got nothing better nation apart you know in Britain means a very big wild area but it might not mean that over here so here we go Lincoln Memorial the Lincoln Memorial is the one where Lincoln is is on there Washington Monument that is the one I'm thinking of so let's work this out so I yes serve a large ranger station excellent ah that's brilliant okay so we are literally here and I'm just gonna have a quick look around because we've got buildings here I can't really work that out to be honest we could be partly there's two buildings there I can only see one do we presume that there's another building there what's going on there what's going on yeah I think we're about there actually her let's go there four meters 5000 points excellent I think this is quite harshly marked it's nothing like the world-version quite harshly marked I think if I remember rightly so gotta be careful but yeah great start well done if you have matched that distance and have just you know just got a perfect score right this looks like I was gonna say Rome but we've got a French flag over there so can't be wrong they definitely wouldn't fly the French flag in Italy swordy sake I know we're gonna try and speak French don't need to look at the Sun I'm so used to doing other formats this is a Roman amphitheater isn't it do you know is this the one in Leon which I've actually been to is it the one in Leon it could be you know I mean it looks like it but obviously Roman amphitheaters are going to look quite similar in their nature I think the one in Leon I had more stuff going on at the back but I'm gonna go for it because I'm never gonna live it down if I'm wrong I'm never gonna forgive myself so I'm gonna find that Roman amphitheater in Leon and where was it it was sure it was up here somewhere theatre gallo romaine let's see if it correlates let's have a look here I'm looking north here it does Cora the compass correlates with what I remember because I was very aware that that would that way was north does it correlate it looks like the curvy bit is that side so in that sense no but I'm gonna go for it anyway there's a chance we are in the only other place I know of there being a Roman amphitheater and I'm sure there's lots in France I mean there's some in Britain so there's some in Britain you would have thought that'd be much more in France I know this one in where is it Amiens is it or something like that anyway it doesn't matter I'm gonna go for the lay on one even though I don't think it's quite right ah no wait for it ah less that's the one I was thinking of not Amiens are less and you've got to believe me there I was looking down that neck of the woods you may have noticed oh that's so annoying if I'd have just had a bit more confidence in the fact that it didn't correlate the curvy bit was on the other side maybe I think I would have gone for Arles shoot it mailed sorry mapper if you're watching 865 points is really [ __ ] really so there will be a lot of you who were are pipping me here maybe you've been to Arles it's a very I think it's got a lot of Roman history let's carry on okay wait a minute it's this Legoland is this Legoland well yeah it is it's Legoland but which one we've got to try and judge by the people here whether we are in Windsor hello darling Legoland Windsor yes for those of you who don't know that is the Windsor of the Queen the royal family there is a Legoland there just around the corner and I actually went there when I was about I don't know eight seven so do these people of course the other one would be Denmark I think there's a massive Legoland in Denmark because that's where Lego Lego itself was created so can we look at this family here does this mommy look English does this little girl look English yeah I think I think they look more English than Danish possibly but it's very hard to say very hard to say to be honest what's that is that Newcastle Brown Ale no I think it's converse that would have clinched it do these people to be honest everyone looks quite Danish there's more I can't see any ethnic minorities which would point more towards Denmark let's be honest so I'm thinking Denmark but how annoying again it's gonna be one of those if it is Legoland Windsor I ain't gonna live it down it's it's gonna be like well you stupid boy over there we have churches that look quite well I don't know like they could be they could be anywhere in Europe I guess people shirts and nothing to go by just because they've got English writing on you see that all over Europe and annoyingly we haven't got a name down here in the corner either the person who took it that would also clinch it the thing is in the South of England you do get more people with blonde hair because of the anglo-saxon invaders there's more blonde people down south and yeah so that's gonna skew it the other thing to think about here is I don't even know if I could find Legoland Denmark I cut I wouldn't be able to find it I didn't even think about that I'm not gonna be able to find it just from zooming in am i unless it's near Copenhagen I'm gonna have to go for Legoland Windsor and if it's Denmark I'm just gonna have to suck it up Legoland Windsor there is a little bit like this in Legoland Windsor cuz I remember it in fact it it's very reminiscent of it so fingers crossed that is right there's Windsor can we find Legoland yes we can there it is it's just down the road so is this okay that's driving school whatever that is mini land would that be it yeah that'd be it wouldn't it mini land so can we actually link this up to the paths doesn't really hmm I don't know I'm gonna go there and hope that that is right we've got Discovery Zone up there I guess that could be it fingers crossed are we in Windsor or are we in Denmark somewhere ah man 12 points and it's in Denmark Finland amusement park Legoland and look at that the paths do add up a bit more there I think I would have clicked there as well if I'd have found it and there Miniland is slightly bigger look I don't know I don't know you know I think Windsor might top that terms of the park as a whole who knows 12 points god we're not doing too well okay this is ground zero Wow Freedom Tower just being completed and these are all the names look wow that is Laurence Christopher able Glen Jay Travers quite stark isn't it there it is the foundation of the actual building I wonder if you can go down inside that at all underground cuz I would have thought the foundations go quite far down yeah pretty pretty deep and I don't mean that as a pun but let's not give those terrorists any credit let's not dwell on this too much let's get in there and she think it was an inside job of course you know I respect your opinion not really I think you're an idiot okay world trade centers here we are here they are then we are on the western side yes that is correct well kind of Southwest we're down in this corner we are down in this corner and we're right by it aren't we so yeah we're right by it about there I think yeah it's gotta be about there and if this is wrong I won't be surprised but it will be down to the position of whoever put the marker here we go what I don't say I picked the wrong one I picked the wrong one what a jackass I've dropped four points how have I picked the wrong one that is J sad he's embarrassing I feel like I've disrespected all of the victims by doing that okay and that does look quite far away suspiciously far away there so I think a few of them might drop to point maybe I don't know maybe I'm just being hopeful next one we're on ten eight seven three here so we've got a I've got to end on a high note I don't know what my record for this format is I never cared to look back I'm sure it's higher than what I've got here this looks like an Indian or maybe a Thai temple they could be in an English family there potentially Henry can you pass the jaffa cakes please these are you can't tell but possibly Asian yeah they don't look dark enough to be Indian can we tell where this is from any other thing he looks yeah definitely more Thai maybe Cambodian that's what I'm thinking that is what I'm thinking yeah writing there I said say it was such a confidence oh yeah that's not Indian that's definitely Cambodian no but I've judged it on the people got not a lot else really to go off so I think it's about going into one of these places Thailand or Cambodia you know what I'm gonna go to Cambodia and I'm gonna go for krong there's a few of them that I always mention I recognize them from people's Facebook photos mainly Krong Siem Reap here we go Angkor Wat and call what Pham let's go here shall we I'm not even gonna I'm not even gonna deliberate too much because I don't think I'll be right but I'll go their way look at that it was actually Angkor Wat the one that I said to begin with what blood there it is uncle what four eight seven seven points I hope I didn't get that years ago on my first couple of videos there's a chance I did I guess especially considering I actually got it right maybe there's a subliminal thing going on there I don't care I haven't got time to make another video now for eight seven seven points we've got a decent Hall at the end there to bring us back in it but Denmark I never would have found that at least I know where it is now Billund if I was a bit more knowledgeable of the world I would have known that Legoland Denmark was in Billund never mind maybe I could have looked for the airports the airport would have done it I guess that would have aided me anyway no point crying over spilt Lego we did alright we did okay what was that one oh yeah New York and Washington I thought that was two different ones that had got wrong 1575 Oh points well done guys if you beat that score I'm sure some of you did and some of you won't done so you're just gonna have to live with that deep embedded pain for the rest of your life no thanks for watching as always and however you may have done please let us know how you got on in the comment section and please hit like and subscribe and I will be with you soon with

"hello everyone welcome back to the channel it's Friday so that's that's good I however have embarked on my adventure my expedition across Wales I am a day in as we speak as you watch this hopefully still alive and kicking but I've left you with this a diverse world no moving around game something I haven't done in ages I only ever did two of these and both of them were quite some time ago and I don't think they would play along games I think it was just me playing it so that's good for you you can play along to this something a bit in you save me doing urban world which will return but it's something different so challenge then here we go no time limit oh come on get this code and yeah it's all been a bit rushed this week so I'm leaving you with what I can and yeah whatever happens happens you might you might beat me here because I'm a bit I'm rushed I am rushed there's lots to do I've got a waterproof my coats and bagging I've got to charge all my GoPro batteries I've got lots to do here we go let's do this a diverse world no moving around and we're on a big ol while we are on a big bridge a very tall bridge this is cool wow this is cool I wonder if this is reminds me of the bridge that's near split was it split or was it to put no isn't Dubrovnik wasn't it this is if I'm not mistaken this is that bridge in Dubrovnik I did a hole for those of you don't know I did a whole game in Dubrovnik courtesy of hometown roulette and this bridge featured on most of the rounds in fact I think there was a round where I was down there along the coast and I used the bridge to my advantage yeah and there was this as well it was a big ferry terminal we can't see the old town of Dubrovnik I don't you know I didn't even have it on that game didn't even have it in the end did way probably because there's no Google there's no room for cars to fit through those streets but without any further ado let's get on there those of you who watch that video might be an advantage what was his name Aleister Crowley or whatever his name was why am I in Albania don't want to be an Albanian that's a bit different to Croatia so to prove me here we go I think I really think we're there I'm not going to go there but let's look at the compass and have a look at this to our east is this big inlet of land yeah yeah with lots of villages and towns straddling it yeah the border of Bosnia is over there on that hill we have a mountain range you can just see it there look highlighted to be honest I know it's I know this is it without trying to be cocky I know this is it so I'm gonna make my guess let's just look for that Island out there there it is you can see the island so we know where we are now we've just got a judge along this bridge how far we are mmm it's quite tricky actually because you know you can't see the land below you can only really see the bridge it's hard to tell exactly how but I think we're bang in the middle to be honest in fact just for a laugh I'm gonna keep it there oh okay apparently we're over just to the left in the adriatic sea so my mistake it is very easy to get confused there you know i'm all am i in the sea am i on a bridge it is very hard i'm being for seizures of course 5000 points though that's all that matters well done if you got that let me know if it is because of that video alistair if you're playing i'm sure alistair zeppelin that was it alistair zeppelin if you're watching might tell me did you get that cuz if not you should be ashamed right next okay this is totally different isn't it this is well I would say the plains of the USA the Great Plains or possibly Canada so hard to get these rounds it just you know if you take into account the seasons changing and all the different factors that can be going on you know with the grass changing color and whatnot let's just see where the Sun is I don't think I can see the Sun what is that it that is the Sun isn't it and it's you know it's slightly to the south but that's not if it was in the north I'd be worried I'd say well we're in Argentina but I don't think we're in Argentina it doesn't look like it looks like the USA so I'm gonna go USA but definitely room here to get this drastically wrong definitely room for that because you know it also what doesn't help is that I'm out of practice playing world version of geoguessr if I played that more it might be a bit fresher in my mind I don't know this can't be that far south because of this or you know but it's not it's not fresh in the mind I've just been playing urban world UK and you know bloody god knows what else US sports stadiums and so but all in all it's just a fact that it could be Canada that's what gets to me and then I'm thinking of going like Oklahoma okay I've got to make a decision though I'm gonna go Kansas I don't know I'm going Kansas the road is running kind of that direction isn't it but not that steep but I'm going for it anyway oh it was Canada oh that's so annoying lots of you who have got that as well you'd have just gone in the middle of that plain area there look how far north is it's amazing amazing Canada that is a big wound to 1 9 8 points that's no good is it nearly a thousand miles I thought that would have been more okay let's put that behind us let's have a look at the Sun here because it was glaring us daddy's most definitely in the north and the hemisphere not completely North now look at that that is a big stadium that could almost be like a bull would you call it a rodeo type thing you know could be one of them I don't know what they get up to in these South American countries which is I think where we are yeah it's looking very Andean is that the word and easy and of the Andes if you like Peru is what I would have a stab at Peru yeah where it kind of comes towards the sea or possibly Bolivia or Chile now I can't see any flags the buildings are just far too far away for that so we're gonna have to just judge it on this it's an interest in place because if I add hours to look at the map I reckon I could find that the way that these three roads we're almost above them err really aren't we you know we can see that they also have converged to two nothing really to the mountain and then we've got this unique blue stadium over here and then what appears to be a cemetery so it's an interesting place but yeah I've got to get in there that looks like a sort of estuary maybe the Seas up that way maybe not though because it's up to the north anyway let's get into the map analysis heading to that 104 estuary is heading to that could be couldn't it into Lake Titicaca I don't know Peru I think we're in Peru do you know what though I am gonna go down here and say that the estuary is heading in understates this estuary here it's not is it there's no mountains by it okay forget that forget that okay let's just forget that idea I don't even know if it's an estuary but I think Peru Bolivia about this Lake here let's go right on the border with Peru Chile and Bolivia okay that's got to go down as a good guess what country to actually click in the correct one Bolivia so if this was 10 country challenge I would be ecstatic right now we were in a place called huwa nuni who a new knee and can we see what that stadium was stadion Manuel Flores no it's not telling us what that is in aid of that stadium which is a shame maybe you can let me know in the comments if you're from South America particularly Bolivia you can tell me what that stadium is for but that is an excellent guess for two six three well done if you beat that or got anywhere near to it next one four out of five then and this looks like a pesky round doesn't it looks like a pesky one I think a lot of you will be in ingredients maybe you've switched tabs you don't know your result yet I do maintain that's the funnest way to play along do you think switch tabs before you find out what result you've got watch me play it see watching me you know god he thinks that I should think that no not necessarily and then you see the result anyway anyway where the friggin hell is this right okay the Sun we can see the shadow there so the Sun is directly behind us there it is we're not going mad that is southern hemisphere isn't it if anything no I don't know no it's directly to the west so that's no good could this be Spain looking round could this plane yes it could the road is quite Spanish this could be Spain very easily we've got crops here we've got like a crop field looks a lot like Spain to be honest it could be Mexico I'm sure but I don't think many other many other places really I'm going for Spain because I was there in the summer and it reminds me a lot of the places that I was driving around to be honest so I'm getting get in there got mountains up to our north here's some mountains here let's go just below there because it doesn't look too south and it doesn't look too north you know we've got a crop field but then it doesn't look all that north either so I'm gonna go down here below this mountain range and if I'm right WowWee that will be incredible here we go I was freaking grease oh man look at that latitude that is a beautiful thing look how it just straddles the top of the Turanian see label there it is that's what you want to see Sardinia what can't even read it mate my line is just obscuring it yeah I'm distracting from the fact that I failed quite miserably there I've got a score of 1443 Greece we were in Greece I just Oh God please please don't terrified of closing the wrong tab there as well yeah Greece my god you don't get it that much ah and the fact that I said are you see the Spain or Mexico couldn't be anywhere else I thought of Italy I thought of Turkey didn't think of Greece ok last round 12 904 is the score my god are we gonna end this on a really bad note I've just set myself up for it with that last round and this is an interesting looking one too we've got big tall trees among small ones which is kind of weird the lights obviously getting through to those little ones that they can grow interesting the only reason I'm mentioning that is because I was just in Wales yesterday or the day before rather to do some prep for my mission across Wales and some of the woods that I think I'm going through have disappeared because they're forest management and then other ones have grown and the tall tree woods are no problem but it's the ones where they've planted these smaller Christmas trees and they're all competing for space and they're all squashed together and honestly I don't know how I'm gonna get through those I honestly I was like oh god there's like a mile I'm a constant mile of squash together trees so we'll see how that goes anyway the Sun is directly to the west I just don't know where we are to be honest I really don't so he's directly to the west does that mean we would be a bit further south then you know Sweden Finland he does it does look warmer here I've got to say could we be in like Switzerland or something I I don't think so could we be in Estonia Latvia these hills are quite big aren't they so I'm thinking not because they're quite flat countries that for your Lithuanian are quite flat I don't know I can't see many big mountains going on I've never had a mountainous round in any of these countries so I'm gonna rule those up could be Sweden I'm just not sure about this Sun thing well it don't would it be directly west because surely that would mean you were further south oh I don't know I don't know about that so where could we be down here could we be in Italy up in the Alps towards the Alps could we be in Canada I think we could be you know I think we could be in Canada do I go for Canada or are we in Europe I honestly can't tell it apart at the moment freaking hell I'm going I'm going Canada I think and we're really rolling out Sweden Finland Norway the road doesn't look very Norwegian does it okay I'm going Canada  me okay I'm bound to get a score though that's the thing I see annoying thing about this okay it's not very hilly down there not very hilly there either oh I hate this okay I'm going over here then here we go this could well be in Europe but here we go ah there it is that is Bulgaria one to one that's why it seemed further south Bulgaria really Bulgaria view summary daddy's poor that he's poor there at the end have we done that well we managed to get Dubrovnik spot on which is amazing the lapaz guess was good but the other three I've got to say was oh really so well done if you beat that score maybe you beat me just by getting a more consistently average you know 3,000 points score every time I which I think would be tricky really be unlikely but or maybe you just kind of you did what I did but you didn't mess up on the last round or something let me know but I am a bit flustered at the moment I'm a bit rushed I haven't been I'm not very impractical hope you enjoyed the vid anyway guys and well done if you beat me I promise when I get back from the trip if I make it back in one piece I will up my game on these and I'll make them especially harder for you to be try and get some insane guesses in there so yeah thanks for watching as always everyone and I'll see you very soon take care tada ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 42.66824331225625, "lng":

evening everybody I am back I have returned from my mission across Wales intact with all my limbs fingers toes penis all intact just about I've got very scratched wounded hands from all the thorns but that's all I'm gonna give away guys I'm not gonna tell you anything to do with how it went what happened nothing I'm gonna save it all for the edited series and I'm sure you'll be grateful when that does come out that I didn't give anything away for now the schedule is kind of back on we back on world city when say it is Wednesday isn't it yeah it is okay I wasn't quite sure of what day it was then so Cape Town an African first never been to South Africa in the flesh myself I've been there plenty of times on geoguessr but never to Cape Town to my knowledge I've made my own map because I wasn't what wasn't totally pleased with the ones on offer already not enough locations or if they were that parameters were too far out so I've drawn them in a bit and I'm gonna challenge it I'm gonna do five minutes per axe I think you guys enjoyed that last time being able to play along five minutes per round copy that I'm not gonna pay six I'm feeling I'm feeling hard feeling badass but yeah Cape Town meant to be a wonderful city diverse great nightlife and it's got that mount in what sits on the side table top Sugarloaf oh yeah that one let's play it five minutes per round okay that looks like a school this school is a very good school that's an impression of my headmaster from school Sun Valley what's cool is that I just want to say I know it probably won't matter Oh primary school okay Sun Valley primary school do you know what can I even find out I'm only gonna look for 15 seconds don't worry I know the parameters I've done Sun Valley Sun Valley no can't see it and I that's all I'm doing ten seconds right I don't know which mountain tabletop would be anyway coracle coracles drew does that mean coracle Street we're at the edge of the town here to the north does that mean would that be there there's mountains there would we be over here this is a gamble of course but it does add up Sun Valley is that where we are or could we be just a bit over to here I should be exploring I know I should you don't need to tell me that but uh I just thought I'd gamble are there any mountains to the north anywhere else not really about here Sun Valley got it so I didn't think my parameter was that far down I cut it off somewhere here so this would be towards the limit okay I've used the surroundings to kind of make a decision that I don't really need to look around too much Sun Valley we got there where is it I've lost it i flooded lost it there it is okay Sun Valley primary school there it is that is it isn't it so were we there that's what I want to know let's go back I know there was a bend yet that strip of grass carries on so we are basically there how strict is is going to be well let's not put it to chance where is that building it's not on there the building isn't on there look at the security that they have here much needed I'm sure so yeah we've got no buildings to go on where's Bo yet presence that is there so are we halfway no we are about there I would say plenty of time to guess this yeah I would say we're about there four point one meters stuff could have inched down a bit further to the south so yeah well done if you have matched me there the distance isn't too important important guessing the score is getting the score yeah a full score 5,000 points that's what you're after isn't it okay next one next round in Cape Town so knees out looks really warm and beautiful Pleasant that's got to be Table Mountain hasn't it table top mountain whatever it's called and we're quite far from it we're over to the east here as reeva Steenkamp here he's walking a dog oh she's gone I have just remembered she is actually dead I don't know why I didn't process that that's kind of turned into a pretty sinister looking joke never mind that's what I'm all about right I'm going north and let's get this I tell you what let's go back to the start and let's get the name of this little cul-de-sac because well we need to don't we we need to here it is Mopani kelvar boom it looks like but I don't know the Pawnee Calvert I don't know if that's this one either or the main road let's go north and I think we can get it the quicker we find this road if we can the the quicker we can find the one we started on the little cul-de-sac so hoping to get to a junction at some point here's a junction but it ain't really a huge one is it so let's carry on here we go this is the kind of beefy Junction I was hoping for now I'm not impressed by the signposts to roads here not really that impressed oh wow there on the floor only in how to Avenue I've never seen that before and it's here blink and you'll miss it cool yeah kerboom Crescent okay we've got world estates International Balu scissor yeah I'm just trying to think whether I can kind of work this out from where I am do I need an area like I had in the last one here we go here's a big sign I should probably have written those signs down because they're not very memorable right militant and blue Berg strand it's all very Dutch sounding isn't it right yeah let's get in there there's militant that is to the north blue Berg strand is there I don't think that would have been on the map platter Kloof vague plotter Kloof there look [Music] pyro is down there m14 there look so I think we should be at this Junction pyro is to the south that correlates okay let's see if we can find then surely we're not on this the one are we know cuz that runs underneath that is a bit confusing maybe we're further up then okay I need to go back and find the name of this road and quick because I've forgotten it let's get back to the world estate thing ahlian hoot Avenue so that's what I'm looking for ahlian hoot and it's heading it's kind of heading this way isn't it so I think if I scan up here it can't be the a scene looking for alien hoot with 56 seconds left I'm worried now ah got it thank God it's it was hard to see because it's just a little white road and here's kerboom crescent map Arnie Street and we've got there with 40 seconds to go okay right by the edge I can safely go there 7.7 hmm we were a bit further back apparently fair enough 5000 points though crucially let's move on to round 3 right doesn't say hush hirtius mmm okay Hirsch is that is a company let's get our bearings it right that's north I presume we're heading south here oh you're sorry I'll be auditing I don't find this boring at all I just think I haven't caught up on sleep yet Milnes and Business Park okay we're not far away from where we were in the last round still a lot of work to do though Kohlberg Road Montague Gardens is to the South Milnes and Business Park will surely we can just get in and and find that fine Hersh's as well let's get in there Milutin can we cheekily find the Business Park Montague Park which direction was that then Montague Gardens come to the south okay right I'm looking for Hersh's Hersh's there it is her she's militant that is over there so where would that put us then see if we can get a road name here they look super easy these rounds but you can still get confused well I can anyway we're to the north so I would say we were about there let's go back yeah I mean there is the north yeah we have to be there don't we so the edge of Hirsch is I don't know whether it's counting it up to the roof I would say it probably is I mean from an aerial view that would be what you'd see isn't it so I am gonna go there 9.8 it's have a look what it counts in the roof possibly okay that's well yeah it was but apparently we were directly in line with it controversial there but we were still within the parameter whatever that parameter may be yeah I presume it'll be 10 meters 15 meters not quite sure but anyway we still on for a perfect score well done guys if you are keeping up and even well er done if you did it in a any sort of quicker time than that its carry on right now I've heard about this this sort of militant real need for security in South Africa look yeah everything even though they're quite small properties everything is really fortified with curb security and yeah a lot of crime I would imagine on these outskirts anyway just wasted 30 seconds I think I've subliminally totally forgot that we were in a race against time it's my downfall I get complacent that's why I messed things up right I'm heading north here and it does look like we're further out as I say but I'm heading north for some reason I'm just going with the flow hoping to get a road name and oh bloody hell okay let's get a road name look at that as well I don't know what that is but that is very heavily fortified right do we get a road name here because if not then that is pretty any danger right well that is crap let's go back to the start and go the other way towards this mountain which could be tabletop Mountain it's to the south though oK we've jumped straight onto a main road that's good might not be tabletop Mountain and that is a dead end hopefully we can jump over the barrier there I would have thought yes we can okay so we're not gonna get the name of that which is really annoying but what we can get is this Junction so we shouldn't have too much of a problem finding that right north gate guard these places have really weird n1 Paul pardon Eiland pardon Eiland pardon me land hardened Eiland okay what have we got over here that's got to be tabletop isn't it Muizenberg right I'm gonna go I'm gonna go on this one at the moment so section Street north gate pardon Eiland now if that is Table Mountain that is yes it is I'm pretty sure it is in fact we can see the center over there so we can pretty safely say that we're sort of around here somewhere I reckon here's the one the n1 Northgate is apparently this away pardon Eiland there it is it's two words on the map now section Street there I've just so happened to have seen it there section Street so look at that Junction that is that's crazy can we see that I think that might be it there that might be part of it at least so if that is that then we are looking I've got to be careful here I think we're there Princess Alice Avenue I would have thought is what we were on possibly know possibly not okay let's get back over here which is where we just were still a bit cloudy headed to be honest I'm a bit out of practice now we were here weren't we that does correlate because it goes round doesn't it Princess Alice Avenue 51 seconds left I just don't remember it bending round at all Air Force Museum section Street I think we've got to be there what is that aqua concepts thing wait that changed that definitely changed when we jumped over I've got 20 seconds left I'm very aware of the time that did change right let's go back to the start oh god we're really far down aren't we 14 seconds left I don't even know if this is the right Road I'm going there there I don't know if this is right oh my god it is Wow all of a sudden I didn't have much time left I wasn't entirely sure whether this was the right road not only because I couldn't see any of these correlating aqua concepts but also in my memory when I followed this Princess Alice Avenue I got to the end and it said coldy sack on the right and that clearly isn't oh yeah it is it is a cul-de-sac p8 Gras blur also that kind of does correlate this you know fenced wall that was here so I kind of did think it was Princess Alice Avenue but then all of a sudden I had 7 seconds left saw this lady and walk and quickly had to count the houses and as a result of clicking hastily if somehow got 1 meters my best distance by a country mile right last round we're on for a perfect score so I don't want to balls this up now what's going on there I thought he was like pissing on someone then this guy I don't know what's going on in reality right let's go this way I feel like we might be closer towards the center of Cape Town which is good be nice to see the center main are all have a scene Maynard do I get this road name I think I do can I get the road name it's really bad for road names I won't lie sort it out Cape Town right Clermont is up here on the m4 which is their so em for their google letter google letter is on the m9 to the right there you know i think we found it already KFC Maine Ardmore yeah don't believe it I only plan to do a little preliminary Scout there but we have yeah we've somehow stumbled across Maine Ardmore absolutely amazing right let's go back now we went to the south to the north there is a bend let's have a look here yes it bends does indeed let's have a look at this alley well row let's see if that's the one that's right here not that we get in many street names but I think there might be something here alley well Road yes absolutely it's not disturbed their chat and we've got a big soft building here with the Sun cresting over it let's see if we can find that sure triumph sure triumph can't see that she's gonna have a little gander down here just see how far it actually was that we went yeah it was quite far pretty far down to there so I think we're actually he's that the building he stopped the big building that we were looking at I don't know that it did the dddddd I don't know that it is because that's right by the turnoff however this building isn't on there in that case I can see an outline of a property okay let's have a look at the buildings on the other side I've got that one on this one nothing's really correlating here oK we've got these two that one and that one okay they are that and that so we're more like their I would say but got to be 10 meters 15 meters accurate here so cannot balls this up that would be a travesty I'm going there for now what we seem to have more is just property boundaries you know this line here that doesn't add up cuz look I've got time here to work this out I need to get this right here we've got four buildings one two three four that doesn't correlate with what I'm looking at there Danny camp I just I'm not seeing any of this but we definitely had Ally well Road unless we are here no we can't be Ally well Road my god the alley well Road does run for a while I'm just doubting myself here how far does it go for it stops there right I'm gonna leave the marker there and I'm gonna make sure that this is main road surely it has to be but where are we gonna find this out I don't think we can come way and I've got 25 seconds left that's gotta be the junction yeah I've got to go there guys I've got 10 seconds left I could have checked where Indian Road was ah ok I'm gonna have to go for that 2.7 Wow thank God I really didn't know whether that would happen for me thought that may have been you know for some reason just very wrong you know that does happen to me as you know totally wrong but no 2.7 meters a sterling effort and you know our guys try your best to try and beat that if you will the total distance there is 25 point 3 which I'm quite pleased with nine point eight seven point seven you know okay pretty good and then four point one and then two point seven and then one and it's that was a funny one because the ones that were closest in the end were the ones I was least sure about but anyway absolutely wonderful to explore Cape Town didn't really get the middle did we but you never do you never get the middle which is really annoying it's kind of a lottery in that sense but still we were in Cape Town and those of you who are from Cape Town hopefully we're pleased to see me explore it so yeah keep your requests coming in for world city Wednesday's please have a pop at trying to beat that and in a few weeks time I will I will go back and review how all of you have done on these various Maps whether you've beat me or not who's in the lead and yeah tune in on Friday for a play along see you soon tada ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -34.1222038269043, "lng": 18.39845848083496}, {"round": 2, "lat": -33.87712860107422, "lng":

Google but you know I was ready to go into Metz in fact I was very tempted to go over to Metz on inspection however it is too flat to the north so Nancy but surely there could have been other options in my head that could have been Troy's Orleans Bush tours Dijon but we somehow landed in Nancy that is quite amazing for 993 points what a star the dream of the perfect score has crumbled but I couldn't give a that is quite amazing right next one and we are in Asia oh yes we are okay don't need to look at the oh yeah we might need to look at the cars to see if they're Japanese or Korean what does that look like now there's no circles but I think that could be Korean don't leave me alone I'm still learning we'll see we'll see if there's any more writing lots of wires of course can anyone tell me why they need so quite so many wires I mean obviously they haven't got underground cables but why it's the rock too hard is it something to do with it being metamorphic rocks and then like that let me know Japs of the world right that he's looking Korean isn't it I think that it's a bit blurry but I think those are circles we've got high on dye that is also a high on die lots of high on noise it has to be said and that he's all we've got to go on really I don't know what that is couldn't tell you what that is a lot of these yeah is that a Subaru which I think a Japanese yeah I think I've got to go for career here Korea here let's have a quick look so look at these symbols here and see if you can see that kind of thing yeah you can already hear in Daejeon I can see the upside-down Y and a vertical stick next to it those are the technical terms seeing as I've inadvertently zoomed in on dejan shall I go for that should I go for that the Sun is quite strong should I go for Daejeon I think it would kind of hurt me now if I went somewhere else and it was day Jean so I'm gonna go for it I didn't mean to zoom in on it but I have which vibe am i getting in terms of where the center is I think South so I'm gonna go the north of dejan let's find a road that correlates with this slightly North East how about one of these it's always worth always worth persevering as we discovered in the last round here we go okay well that ain't bad is it look it ain't terrible where were we Daegu Daegu you've got Incheon Daegu and what was that one then day gone Daejeon yeah I'm learning I'm learning I get yeah I get mixed up with those two so four five nine six points just gotta be happy that you know I got the right country seventy three point three miles could have been a lot worse well done those of you who are beating me now I think some of you will will be beating me and it will probably probably blood blubber blubber arms it will probably be down to look let's face it because there weren't any clear-cut clues but nonetheless well done I reward I applaud you for your guesses because you make your own look on this game most the time okay Williams mini we're driving on the left I didn't even clop that to begin with this has got to be Britain hasn't it hmm don't recognize this city city Manchester y'see birkenhead Liverpool a Liverpool Airport rather yeah this this is Liverpool it has to be I think these buildings here are over by the docks the what's it called the Stanley dockyards I can't remem what they called I think that is it I think that is the I can't quite remember the name as I say the Stanley Tobacco dockyards or something and just over yonder will be the River Mersey or rather the Mersey estuary and I think these buildings are sort of you know Riverside apartment doc buildings mixed martial arts academy I think yeah I think we can get in there guys I'm fairly sure I can locate this pretty darn accurately without much jabbering and a flaperon right princes doc let's see what it's actually called royal live--i building no we're over here huh so many docs look at all these docs and these aren't new things these are old Doc's look how long they go on for amazing these are old Victorian at least Doc's okay where's that Stanley tobacco warehouse that's what I was dying to find Prince's doc okay we might not be able to get that then so let's just find Plaza that is over to our well straight in front of us IRA can we looking at this Junction here Williams Liverpool right so yeah yeah North is there I can go here and there's a bus stop apparently there is the bus stop so we can go about there I think I want to get a perfect score here if I can i know it's greedy okay where's the other bus stop in relation yeah I think we've got that about right I think we can probably go there seventeen point seven meters but of course because this is using the world parameters we've got the full score excellent let's move on last but one round and it's looking a lot like the first round except it is Spain I think cara de Calatrava I say gerado de incendios right and we got any sort of crest I do recognize that crest from a football team unless I've just kind of magic that up in my head right Calais Calatrava Carriere Del's cava yes right I'm gonna turn around here are there gonna be any clues as to the city we know it's Spain of sorts any clues here it does look like a touristy kind of place doesn't it like maybe a major historic city of Spain basically is what I'm thinking definitely not in Catalonia or the Basque Country I don't think I retract the the word definitely because that's when it comes back to bite you in the ass Kylie I've given up trying to pronounce these things anything here anything to do with a football team or anything just gibberish isn't it loud yeah louts the lot of you ah now what's this entrada it's almost a classic yeah I feel like it's a poster for a classical concert Dylan no ever something okay that's not the city frustratingly it's been torn and it's quite blurred as well so we can't see that this guy looks quite white I don't know if he's Spanish could be a tourist ah about this Valencia that says Valencia doesn't it it does I'm sure of it and that is really lucky because that is the only clue here I believe right let's get into Valencia try and find this street then let's do it okay now let's not forget it's a big old city where do we think the center is from here that is the question do we think we're to the north the south looks like we're kind of in the thick of it isn't it let's have a look at the direction of the roads so it's running north east isn't it and a lot of them are kind of yeah grid like things and there are I can't see a lot of roads that are running northeast so I'm gonna look around here to begin with I'm not gonna look too long for this street I wonder whether it's better to look for the restaurants and stuff like that might just have a better chance of finding the restaurants than these street names because just because there's so many of them look I do think we're pretty central here let's have a look around here [Music] right I've searched far and wide in the historical city of Valencia I can't find that restaurant how about there okay after all that I don't know why I bother there's the restaurant look borgir there it is we're right in the thick of it there there's no two ways about it we're right in the thick of the center of Valencia it's even you can even see the yellow historic sort of coloring there on the buildings nevermind that's not bad but I think whichever of you saw the two let's sign will have got that and quite possibly closer than I did let's go to the last round this could be make-or-break in terms of whether this is a great score or not let's have a look around then this looks interesting hello the 1980s how may I help you I need a new phone yeah as I thought it is Asia there are the symbols but this time ah wait I don't know we'll see we'll try and find other scripts first yeah we do have the Boxee type things it could be career again folks so we've got a Ford no that is yeah it is a Ford a Toyota which is obviously Japanese let's have a look over here ah now that is different something something Road Shindong Road something like that so that is English writing which for me puts us out of Japan and South Korea instead I mean also we've got a fee up there we've got a master which is Asian I think most likely here we are in somewhere else Hong Kong Singapore let's have a scan for some flags because I'm not entirely sure I'll be able to get it if I don't I think I'll be going on instinct so one thing that I've noticed there's a lot of green there is a lot of green around Macau possibly who knows most of these obscure small Asian places Macau Hong Kong Singapore they all have English writing so don't think it can be Taiwan either I've ruled all of those out Japan Taiwan South Korea look at that I think I'm gonna have a look at Hong Kong and see what the symbols are saying cuz there's a lot of boxes and it's very grid-like isn't it so let's have a look at Hong Kong that looks very Chinese I'm gonna have a look at Macau now how does that look very similar to be fair to Hong Kong and the other option was Singapore and that's just because I'm not entirely sure I'm just looking where the what am I doing there it is okay Singapore yeah I don't think it has this much symbols does it it's it's very much so English writing very much of a Western influence so I'm gonna rule that out at the only reason I thought it might be day is because I have been in Singapore on geoguessr and I have seen symbols and it's throwing me off so anyway I'm thinking now Hong Kong just having a look at Taiwan quickly thinking Hong Kong or Macau because of the English writing that has crept in chené chené dong Road look at that mmm let's see that does look pretty Hong Kong and isn't it do you know I think I'm gonna go for it and this could be the end of the line in terms of this amazing score we are on for a record here by the way if I get this right we're on for a record record is $23,000 failed to mention this at the start so very much in contention to beat that as long as I get this right if I'm in Macau I guess I guess I'll still get a good score so that does make me feel better right I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna go for Hong Kong and yeah I'm gonna go doesn't really matter does it where's the Sun I can't see any mountains anywhere so I think I might go over here somewhere you reckon hmm I remember this side being a lot flatter so I'll go up here here we go Wiltshire Road here goes nothing guys oh my god no it was Taiwan for God's sake I mean the score isn't absolutely dreadful but for God's sake I didn't think they would have the English right in there clearly I've still got some stuff to learn a lot to learn on this sort of thing ah man and lots of you will have got that too 3200 points let's view the summary haven't beaten my record so frustrating but you know what I can't be too disappointed on a side note because overall that is a great school and that map there makes for good viewing well done if you got anywhere near that and even beat it I'm sure many of you did it's a shame that with the current system we'll never know just who because you naughty fibbers out there she let's have a look at this Nancy gues because that was the highlight of the game that might make it into insane guesses depending on how my other videos go yeah a big wager look but also you could argue I made my own look there with the technique of trying to find a city with hilly ground to the north yeah pretty pleased with that overall guys just disappointed with my usual Taiwanese nightmare nothing new thank you so much for watching have a wonderful weekend take it easy tada ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 48.69399585947261, "lng":

"how's it going everyone welcome back to the channel it is Friday again that's come around quick but this week I'm moving away from the urban world no moving series just briefly just just a cool-off period mainly because the score was such a monster it was so big last week I was so proud of that one I think we can have a bit of a cool-off period from that and I'm gonna return to a series I haven't done in ages a diverse world no moving scrolling or zooming do you remember do you remember it I don't think you could play along at the time but um what I used to do was make my guess and then turn around afterwards to see if I was if I'd made some sort of terrible mistake so we're doing that again but you can play along now the record score it wasn't that one it wasn't 25,000 it was 19 6 to 6 so yeah let's try and beat that in terms of an urban world no moving around I am determined to get a perfect score on it but I need more time I it's it's gonna take I need more time in the bank to do that and obviously at the moment have I copied that yes I have at the moment I am swamped with various projects including editing the mission across Wales which is going well it's slow but it's going well for those of you who have asked I'm still editing the first episode you know so it's a it's a big long slow process and I don't have many hours in the week to do it here we go let's see what kind of score we can get on a diverse world no moving scrolling or zooming let's do it this is episode 5 by the way episode 5 Wow look at this we are facing here well looks like we're facing towards land well we definitely are but whether it's the mainland I don't know is this the sea it looks like this kind of manmade segregated sort of strips here niches it looks equally shallow doesn't it so whether these are sort of manmade I don't know salt pools or something who knows but mmm this this isn't gonna be easy is it this is not gonna be easy right the Sun North is that way the Sun is casting shadows kind of slightly north I reckon I don't know very hard to say but mainly East basically is what it's doing so that's kind of inconclusive but obviously in a hot place anyway cars driving on the right God this is a tough way if we're plane world I would say Brazil but we're not we are not where in the world has these salt flats these whatever they are where has lots of them I'll tell you where I think has those Jordan I think the Sun I've seen some here look here's some on the border of Jordan and Israel do I think we're there well who knows maybe but we are heading north the lowest point on earth Museum Wow yeah could we be there probably not doesn't look like it does it but just a thought are we in somewhere like this could we be in Tunisia maybe just pop up a lot doesn't it let's have a look for a few salt flats that's just a lake yes I think I'll probably just try and find somewhere suitable in Tunisia there isn't really a lot else to go off I'm gonna go here even though it's wrong oh my god I don't believe that I do not believe that I am absolutely shocked 3.9 miles I didn't know where I was in the world that's ridiculous it I if if I looked over there I would have clicked there I genuinely would have but I wasn't serious about it I wasn't serious I'd have given up I was ready to go back start again that's ridiculous let's carry on Oh right next one I can't even I can't even think straight now right these signs here are looking like the kind of thing you'd get in Finland but surely this can't be Finland no I don't think so too hot too spicy I could have moved around as well couldn't I after I've made my guess Oh God anyway right I'll do that on this one shadow is being cast huh I'm a little confused actually shadow is being cast yeah that that way isn't it those are the tops of those trees yes that is right that hence the darkness on this Bank and it's kind of the same as last time it's kind of casting it Eastern Lee yeah but but maybe slightly north so my thoughts here are possibly the USA that's what I'm thinking but at the same time I don't really recognize that sign format whereas could this possibly be it's the road that looks American to be honest the lines in the middle and the tarmac the general heat of the whole thing yes so I'm going to guess America and I'm gonna go I still can't believe that guess that is the mostly saying yes I've ever done I'm gonna put it out there if only I'd have seen that that bridge on the left oh my god right Missouri Missouri is what I'm thinking let's do it I'm not even that's the thing I'm not thinking now because I'm just my brain is just it's just been taken over by that last round so maybe this will help me the fact that I'm I'm literally not thinking although it's very flat actually it's not that flat is it if you look around yeah I'll go up here then where it's quite flat God Canada how can that be that is crazy that is so far north and that he's going to bring our points all down one eight nine Oh points there on that round let's see if that evens things out a bit look how far that is over a thousand miles I need to rethink my life there so yeah score at six 873 that's definitely brought it down right l KW stop stop obviously it's the same in lots of languages European cars Volvo Citroen Fiat I don't know what that is I can't see it but Fiat Mercedes Toyota Citroen think that's another Citroen Skoda Renault say at Renault Volkswagen Oh God that really is a mixed map menstrual cycles on a rainy day what I am thinking is lkw I don't think you would have that in France I don't think that's I don't think you would have that in France there's not many K's lkw that is obviously the carpark of some sort of company that that's initials R lkw what kind of country would have these sorts of cars well there's a real mixture as I say there's a Skoda there's Renault is this Mercedes it's a mixture of French German and then Skoda which is Czech Republic and then Volvo which is Swedish of course I would rule out Sweden any of the Scandinavian countries perhaps due to lack of Volvo's but we could be in Poland we could be in Denmark perhaps although unlikely good we can't be in Germany of course we could be in the Netherlands no we can't because the registrations are all white could we be in Belgium possibly yeah we possibly could be in Belgium but I'm leaning more towards Poland or if I'm gonna roll out Czech Republic as well because there's not enough SCOTUS there's only one so I'm gonna say Poland or Denmark here she's a bit risky but yeah I'm gonna go for oh wait would they have stopped but they have stopped in Polish oh that's a toughy I think they would I'm gonna go for it it's a real tough e that is but I'm gonna go for God it's just so many French cars done on leaning towards Belgium now let's go for Belgium let's go on the outskirts of Brussels if this is Poland yes I'll be I'll have a heavy heart but I am I'm making this decision and then I'm going to move around here we go let's go here industrial zone right that is my guess now let's move around something that I've forgot to do in the last two rounds I was just so shell-shocked from that first guess I'm only just coming - right moving around then what cars do we have making an appearance here okay lots more older cars VW Nissan Toyota bit of a mixture okay here we go I've moved yeah well I can't move something Terran Terran okay it's not polish kinda looks Danish or Swedish doesn't it I'm not sure this is Belgium let's make the guess and see what happens it was Germany it was Germany Wow to be honest I wouldn't have ever gone for that because I know a lot of areas do have a street view but a lot don't so wouldn't have gone for Germany also there was a lot of French cars there hell of a lot of French cars especially in a city which I assume makes a lot of cars this whole area is very industrial but that ain't too bad of a score is it I didn't go for France I went for Belgium for three nine five points so yeah that is a decent score and that has brought it back up well done if you're keeping up with me the score now is 11 2 6 8 so we're well on course to beat the record this is Japan surely yeah I mean surely it's Japan look at that for greywater why is the water so gray why is that but this is extremely flat overhead wires of course as those of you who enlightened me is for earth-quaking reasons yeah I'm gonna go in and make my guess in Japan guys while I'm sort of still hot but find somewhere that's really flat wears really flat in Japan probably down by the sea I wonder if we can kind of maybe work out which way the sea is to be honest with you this looks like the kind of area that the sea actually rolled into when they had that tsunami and that was up here somewhere wasn't it where is that I can't see it but this looks pretty flat down here oh no maybe not yeah where is that become with F didn't it where is that nuclear plant I can just see the debris making its way over these fields and cars desperately trying to drive away from it okay I'm just gonna go here no I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not going to settle at that not going to settle at that this is all too mountainous Sindh I sure it was around here somewhere I can't even remember the name of the nuclear power station was it Fukushima something like that okay I could go around here somewhere yeah I'm just gonna go here this looks pretty flat around here here we go no no no no no no you don't know you don't tae-won look at this yeah look at that flat as a pancake course it is ah the Taiwanese Japanese war never ends it never ends in my brain okay next time next time I get something that flat I'm going Taiwan but you just know it'll be Japan right last round need to end on a high here okay right it's sunny it's Mediterranean looking looks like Spain to be honest it looks like Spain yeah what the shadow saying the Sun is over they're casting them off to the west in contrast to the very first round which I still haven't quite got over yeah it's casting them West isn't it hmm looks like Spain could be Greece I guess Italy Croatia and go for Croatia I'm gonna go for Croatia I don't know I've just had a rush of blood to the head I'm gonna go for it or is it too mountainous on the whole in Croatia it is pretty mountainous isn't it I might just go for Spain there yeah I'm gonna go for Spain whereabouts though we're not too far north we're not too far south hmm derocker Portugal okay fair enough Portugal can't be too disappointed there on that last round only one country over Oh God as Chiklis view this summary I mean a mixed bag there a couple of stinkers but I to be honest that whole game I was just thinking about this and there was a niggling voice in my head that was saying no one's going to believe you that you haven't maybe had that round before look at it it's unexplainable I didn't even know what country I was in only vague clues and obviously no moving scrolling or zoomin the hardest format it's got to go down as the most insane guess or the luckiest guess I've ever done it's got to but yeah that was playing on my mind as I was playing and I think I lost some steam during that there's the full results so well done if you beat that overall score please comment if you have time with you know taking me through your thought process and how you did and that is it really there's not much more else to say on that other than wow what a guess see you on Monday guys have a good weekend take it easy tada ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 35.75847749866191, "lng": 10.720915530637399}, {"round": 2, "lat": 52.90809575078949, "lng": -111.23748979572412}, {"round": 3, "lat":

"welcome back everyone hope you've all had a good week it's Friday yes get in there it's Friday and I have another fantastic urban world play long game for you already I'm already back twenty four five five eight is now the score to beat which is a whopper let's face it that was if anyone in case anyone didn't see that that was three perfect score rounds and then two one slightly off and then one a bit more off so surely the quest now is to get a perfect score without moving and as I've said last week surely this is the the format to do it you're not going to be doing that on a diverse world or the the normal version of geoguessr I mean you'd have to be insanely lucky to even think about doing that so yeah the quest continues but you know first and foremost we're going to have fun and we're going to see if we can get some nice juicy detective work in there and the perfect score just a back burning desire if you like so let's create the challenge and go boom boom boom boom boom boom there we go pasted copied at least pasted remains to be seen where are we going to start proceeding proceedings today what is this language God who've we got on these oh we have her don't we she's our L'Oreal woman she's been doing it for years probably time to call it a day to be fair um right what have we got uni coughs what is this language let's look around huh need more clues I need more instant clues yeah it's it's looking Thai yeah Phuket look Phuket grocery Phuket grocery right so I'm guessing we're in Phuket in Thailand I mean we've got to be okay I'm on this up now as a potential perfect score without Rana jinx it so we've got this what is this Phuket grocery that's what it's called isn't it ger yeah that's what they've called it so that's what they call massive shopping centers or you know supermarkets out here fine whatever as long as it gets us there so we'll buy a roundabout as well the grocery store is to the south of us let's get in there because I don't think Phuket well I don't know how big it is let's have a look never traveled Thailand there it is I know where it is there it is and it looks like we're coming out of it over there to the sort of North East so Phuket islands in Ireland yeah it is well yeah cool didn't know that right Phuket Island here we are here's the city is it yes I think so right now can we find Phuket grocery I think it's optimistic to think that I can find it that zoomed in so we'll zoom in a bit more what color is it gonna be it's gonna be like this isn't it blue Phuket grocery hopefully that's the one yes it's by a big roundabout this is awesome okay I'm going there eight point two meters cockily place to here without a care in the world but it's got the results 5000 points the quest for a perfect score in this format is well underway again and if you can a furious typing to my left that is not some twelve-year-old kid that I've hired to help me cheek it is my girlfriend she's working hard and I'm distracting her as we speak so next round Caledonia Italian beach where all sorts of things jumping out me there but Italian Beach where but in English with a sort of Spanish come Italian name it's quite an Italian own to be fair let's look around Zankou oh it's it's polish yeah Poland very confusing so we've got its Hallion beach weights in english italian-themed just gonna absorb that and then we'll move on oh yes I like this Matej key might a key whatever pronouncing these things isn't at the forefront of my agenda at the moment Centrum Alika jana can we find this or does that mean centrum i doubt it does I've just never heard of it but I'll go in there and have a bloody good luck I'm just gonna have a look around though yeah just seeing if there's anything on here that I've may have heard of not really I'm gonna bank on this being a city might a key might a key that's what I'm gonna call it who knows that might even be the correct pronunciation right let's look for this city then which I've never heard of here we go [Music] right I have looked everywhere in Poland I'm definitely going to speed that up but I cannot find this name and the same name because I'm starting to think it's not a place my takee Zankou I'm gonna have to look elsewhere now because dad is just I've looked everywhere I cannot stress that enough so yeah I'm gonna have to start looking at other things while he something something sat Sapolsky I think we're more likely in the biggest city more established city here trust me if this was a city I would have just found it on the map I looked everywhere so and this obviously is a big city that's the thing it's quite a big place so we've got something Samko au-pair all we can see is op8 something na Zam coup Tara's opera any clues to any sick for God's sake how did I not see that it's opera she is in shares I seen so many of you will have seen that I just glazed over it okay so whatever this is whether that means central centrum or maybe Bleeker Gianna maitake be a weird way of doing it having the first two words small and then the last one big it's definitely thrown me off anyway got to work this out now we are on we buy a park there's a park there and I think I've just seen on the map where we might be in actual fact and I think it's here possibly not to be fair okay let's rethink that it's get in the center hmm ah I tell you what would help if I actually use the compass for what it's for right now we're facing north so this park is too he's that's gotta be the Junction's air I think but the only thing is is this the road name that I've been looking at for the past ten minutes he's on the wrong bit but no we have to be about here but I'm just gonna try and cement that by looking down here the thing is that's not even the right that's not even this Road look it's this jacket mouth not gonna bother but that's I don't know that's throwing me off definitely that apparently is a driving school something thirteen let's see if that's visible as a high building yeah it kind of is I'm gonna go here guys here we go six point eight get in that's two rounds with a perfect score three to go can you imagine oh my god what have we got here this is hate to jinx it but this is possible the road names blurred out would you believe it okay we can do this we can do this right right where do I start Brussels bar not necessarily in Brussels but we've got a Brussels bar okay what else have we got Toula bu d f-- antes yeah French would be the language of bristles and again we've got actress act iris Brussels so we are in Brussels without too much doubt now what he's going to be able to give this away for us well we're definitely on a main we're definitely in the middle on the intersection of two main streets annoyingly we can't see the street name although it's a long one we know that it's a long one so that might help us sort of locate it a bit quicker supermarket Delhaize supermarket Delhaize that might be what does it for us cyber net and phone I doubt there'll be a massive force on the Google map movie star you know it could be a culmination of all of these things to be fair but certainly the supermarket might be a good one it looks like we're heading into the old Talon there or some sort of old town and that way not so much the problem we have is that Brussels is marui civ it is a massive city so it's probably best that we get in there and start looking let's get a vibe for this I do feel like we're in the middle oh God right it's going to be a matter of me trying to find Delhaize supermarket I think oh god this might take a while so I'll probably have to speed this up you know on second thoughts I reckon this might be a good shower Archie Pell bar because there's lots of bars on the map there's lots of orange icons so yeah I'm gonna keep my eyes peeled for that wish me luck [Music] got it I don't believe it I've found it that didn't even take that long Archie Pell now I've got to be careful here because that might be a chain but I don't think so we've got a long street name here Rudi March Oh poo let's the march of the chickens so what that means I doubt it but could that be that oh it's so blurred we can't tell but crucially what have we got over here well orange shop do we have an orange shop can't see it I think it's unless that's it no I don't think it is so that's apparently their pin grill chemist yes yes we've got chemist supermarket ad and Spock yes we are there I don't believe it we've got it we've managed to pinpoint this street in Brussels thanks to Archie Pell Thank You Archie Pell right I'm gonna click there guys 6.2 fantastic three perfect score rounds down two to go with the click of this button we will know whether or not that it's possible pretty much we'll definitely know if it's not depending on what round we get or god this is tough this is tough to take here we go Oh God oh my word right okay I'm not quite sure because we have this I'm not hopeful here I'm really not hopeful right yuck sick blah blah that seems turkish god this might be really tough if we can't get a street name okay we've got this stuff there is hope it's probably a long video and Cara serigraphy calm and Cara is a huge city and we might not even be there I've got this and Cara Booya cursor here belly DSE we had that word the other day that might be why I didn't get that one right right sir Kelly oh is that right we've got we've actually got a lot of stuff here you've got a lot of stuff so it might be it might be the case of it might be a case of I might have to speed things up from time to time but you know I've got to do this I've got to try so serigraph and Cara it's just so hard to know what is place-names and what isn't but I'm gonna work my way I'm gonna chip away at this one way or another right there's the Turkish flag just to cement that and they're in the background that's got to be Ankara look at that that is huge what a huge city so that is directly to the north we might be able to work this out we've even possibly got a street name here but if not surely this stuff will do it for us right let's get to work then so Ankara is directly to the north the city center there it is so I would have thought how far away would we be we could be around here we could be down here I thought I would have thought more likely down here no no it's it's more northern isn't it yes so down here somewhere it's what I'm thinking right my god this might be tough but I'm going to get there I swear to God and they look round here guys for a while and probably speed this up I'm looking for any of these clues but it's going to be such a long drawn process that I don't think it's worth watching all of it but anything of note I will include in the video okay here we go I'm off right bit of an update I'm really struggling to find any of these names these words obviously I don't know if they're place-names or or what so at the moment I'm resorting to trying to find this long straight east to west running road which is pretty damn long and obviously with this huge unbuilt on wasteland to the north of it this might take me ages guys but I'm determined to get there ok I'm going back in well I am beat I am absolutely be I have searched this I know Ankara like the back of my bleeding hand but there's just I'm gonna be fascinated to know where we actually are I've been to the north of ously it looks like we're in the south judging by that but I've searched the north the West everything looking at the lay of the land where the hills are everything and I'm sure I've looked at every single road that in my head could have possibly been this one if it turns out that I'm somewhere that I was near to where I was searching I'll be you know just gutted and if it's somewhere if completely different then I'll just be annoyed because it was just a massive waste of time but here we go I've clicked somewhere that I think we might possibly be I'm not even gonna look at it anymore because I know it's wrong but here we go my god you are kidding me okay right yeah I definitely thought we might have been here at one point but nothing here in these shops my god I was so close to go in here at one point I genuinely was as I say I searched everywhere so confusingly we were to the north of the centre apparently and we were looking up at all this which I did consider towards the end but nothing here I mean there was like four or five different sort of shops weren't there nothing added up there also there was a road there if you go back and look that isn't there on the map so just a nightmare round really and it took I was searching for at least half an hour then just in the faint hope that I could actually do this this perfect score with no moving around that was such was my dedication but for 9 69 points you know not too bad I guess lots of you would have actually beat me on that round because look where I went but anyway last round the dream is over okay what will our last round bring then let's try and end on a high the score is 1996 9 so if we can add 5,000 onto that that will be just amazing and it will definitely spur me on to try and get the the perfect score right let's get into this this is weird no name yes Assaf gmail.com annoyingly he hasn't used his country's URL whatever you call it let's have a look around the mmm Oh a flag there's a flag look is that Egypt is it Jordan Oh we'll have to keep looking I think my brain is pretty damn fried from all that searching but surely isn't that isn't that Hebrew not Hebrew that flag would suggest not let's keep looking we've got pots and pans now we've got pots and pans in the background mmm yeah that's that's gotta be Hebrew isn't it so what was that flag doing what was that flag rather more to the point but they you've got like Arabic by the looks of it this is all I needed this is all I needed okay that's gotta be Hebrew gushing water now into the equation right I'm just so confused by this flag I really am it's not Lebanon I'm gonna have to just go into Israel I think guys can't see what else it could be possible see over there to our West so that could be the Mediterranean but yeah I'm fairly sure that that is the is rare that is Hebrew but it's just this flag that's throwing a spanner in the works really what makes it even more confusing is it's really unlikely that any sort of you know Muslim country flag would fly in Israel let's run the Gaza Strip but they just they wouldn't be speaking Hebrew would they sir a real tough one unless the borders there and we're like sort of here but that's no that's Egypt ah so yeah really confusing I mean we can't be the flag looks possibly Egyptian but we can't be in Egypt I wonder put down here there's any sort of crossover I don't think there is I'm gonna go I'll at again and hope that someone's flying the Egypt flag which would be less offensive than any sort of Palestine flag and yeah I'm gonna go here here we go he goes nothing can we end on a high that's annoying that is annoying because I thought the sea was over there I said that didn't I why did I just complete why did that leave my brain god that's annoying I think that fourth-round killed me off a bit if it'll just let me scroll up yep thank you Tel Aviv are the heist bloody annoying what did I say that the Mediterranean Sea was to our West the flag threw me off obviously it was all the flags full blame the flag so then 24:06 nine miserable isn't it because that doesn't even beat the score from last week after all that but nonetheless it's a good score in any man's book I'm sure that would pop out sort of second or third by the way shall I bring back leaderboards for my high scores I did do it for a while but I sort of gave up I couldn't be bothered right let's show the full results here they are look did any of you get a perfect score I mean I won't believe you if you say yes especially with that last round I don't think that was possible unless you were from Tel Aviv but yeah I would I would love to know how you guys did were you level pegging with me did you get the first three rounds perfect score up until things went pear-shaped for me let me know obviously it takes more time if you really trying to do this but it can be done just need to sort of fast-forward it a bit but yeah just wow this video has changed things a bit from now on it definitely it's a thing it's on the cards I might even change the this sort of series name - row - perfect score without moving or something like that or maybe you should keep it the same but just keep trying let me know what you think I should do there and that's it have a great weekend I'm going to bed I think after that and I'll see you on Monday take it easy ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 7.878490979086294, "lng": 98.39792158824037}, {"round": 2, "lat":

Anton where I was a couple of winters ago to see it because apparently that had the biggest Network look at that for a network of ski resorts you can literally do like a three-day trip where you just cross current cross-country ski you could start here look go up here look at all these different lifts that there are down here you can ski down here off piste up there down there up there down there all the way over to vath and you can even probably go up here all the way to Germany incredible anyway that's really off-topic let's go to the next round screw buddy do what he do that was for the ski fans here we are in what looks to be Thailand yeah there's the Thai flag that was quick for the country wonder if we can get the actual place well I'm not so sure could we be in the capital I'm pretty sure we could be in the capital here but how we gonna work that out is there gonna be any sort of blue sign may be a sign that we that has English writing on that looks Airport ish doesn't it that hmm yes okay let's go for Thailand and let's go I'm just gonna go to Bangkok sorry to be boring and I'm gonna go up here pyat I well he three miles I think even in Bangkok Ian's terms daddy's all right and look at this look how it zoomed me back in and back out I do so hope that that doesn't persist okay well that's a good guess and a good score let's carry on we might can we sneak Leiby to school here ah this is britain 100% a this is britain and well we haven't been here hopefully it's not going to zoom me back out of that so something something oh recycle some oh my god there what does that say I'm he's really head forward something Castle at the end I'm sure of it something Castle now there are places in Northern Ireland that have all this might offer us a clue cooks enclose Catherine Cookson she was an author what does that say n e anyone anyone home now I'm sure it doesn't say that can we get a closer look over here not on that one I don't think this one might be our best bet no could that say New Castle that is definitely the crest of the city isn't it well a city I should say not necessarily New Castle okay it's a pretty scrubby estate I think it's fair to say if you live here I'm sorry but you're a scrubber um yeah the joke's on me because I can't really read the bins can I cooks and where's Catherine Cookson from isn't she from New Castle I think she actually might be you know hey that could say recycling New Castle something like that do you know what I'm gonna go for New Castle because I think Catherine Cookson the author is from New Castle I'm pretty damn sure of that she does all these Geordie books and the only reason I know about them is because there's been representations of them on the TV and the only reason I've seen them is because my mom's been watching them a few years back I promise right so I'm going for New Castle so I've worked it out if it's right purely on Catherine Cookson combined with the castle that I think I can see on the end of that word so let's go I would say the south I don't know why but let's go in some sort of estate you can usually tell the estate's there they're like this sort of shape aren't they the ones that were built around the war time I don't think we're in one of them but let's just go there oh yes we were in New Castle I don't believe it we were in one of these it's been a right ass but yeah if i zoom in look I'm not gonna okay we're in Rin their release cooks and clothes I can only presume named after Catherine Cookson and there you can see that's more of the shape you want isn't it that's definitely yak as you can see the tower blocks there Wow four nine eight seven that is a whopper I really don't think those of you who are from the US or other countries will have got that unless you have better eyesight than me and depicted to Castle and went for Newcastle because that's the only Castle that you know even though it's not an actual castle it's a city maybe you knew the football team who knows but well done well done if you did that beat that and well done if you are beating me all in all but whether you are from Britain or not well done if you guess Newcastle okay fourth round then and we're still on a very good school are we what is what was the the record score I didn't even bother to mentally take that because well I should have done either way definitely should have done right this looks like one where we might be able to figure out where we are Mangan le palace luckily Guate san de metrio ill príncipe Savona hotel central europa altri oh here's a better clue less words but much more useful top Sicily I was just about to say that from all of that I don't really know where we are I was thinking we might be in Italy but also Malta because they do have a large Italian influence but Sicily is where we are the home island of my grandmother yes my grandmother was from Sicily and she was hilarious so if that's anything to go by I would love to go to Sicily and meet the people this guy has had one too many gelatos but will let him off because he might be in the Mafia and he might be watching this video and I might be a dead man who knows so it's Sicily then I think is where we are now come from this sign which I think is the best sign can we work out where we might be it's not the hugest place so Central Europa altri could that be the place ultra vitória manga Nellie palace like ology yet I'm just scanning briefly there are a few big places Messina Catania Palermo son de metrio LA college yet if you know with all the time in the world we can easily get this but I'm just seeing if there's anything that can give it away quicker move on here no I don't think so any Palermo colors anything like that there's pink there pink is actually the Palermo colors believe it or not they wear pink I'm currently doing a manager mode on FIFA 12 because I haven't got any more up to date FIFA's if anyone wants to donate me one that would be great the latest FIFA but I'm currently doing a manager mode with Palermo it's pretty funny ah there we go Cory Catania Catania brilliant and that is actually the city where my grandmother was from believe it or not so can we work this out so we know we're in Catania so we can go back to this sign here I think the sea isn't too far down there judging by it judging by the amount of sky we have so mm maybe not judging by the compass it's more likely to be that way in actual fact the sea is but anyway if we go back over to this sign still very much aiming to get a high score here so can we look out for what's the best thing to look out for here the manga Nally manga Nelly palace might be there's a palace oh that might be a hotel yeah that's a hotel okay it's not an actual Palace fair enough however we are getting lots of hotels on the map or at least three of them that seems to be the only ones in the whole of the city what about over here okay well surely if we keep zooming round the other thing we can look for is the college Yetta which I thought was a college but no they're all hotels aren't they not to worry let's keep looking for hotels huh it's weird that didn't seem to be that many okay you need to zoom in a bit further yeah okay give me a minute [Music] okay I cannot find any of those hotels anywhere in Catania starting to think we're not there um but I'm gonna I'm gonna click here because as we saw here Connie Catania I'm pretty sure that means we're there so um yeah I'm just gonna have a quick look for street names weren't there any street names here didn't even think that yeah I'm gonna guess somewhere in Catania right in the middle I guess just to hedge my bets and yeah let's go for it sorry now if this is wrong okay okay we were out here I wonder if I will ah it's not gonna let me it's not gonna let me go over here is it oh let me see I want to see which hotels were over here to be honest I can't oh there we go it stopped I can't see any of those as I say I did look everywhere so you know please let me know if you can see any of those hotels but they ain't here are they none of them are here either they've all changed their name or they don't exist anymore or they're just not on the map but yeah I'm looking at the pink things by the way so yeah there might be in another color but 499 five that is really good really in the grand scheme of things look that's a pretty good Katainen guess less than a mile away so yet last round here and I still don't know whether we are on to beat my score I'm pretty short you know I'm pretty sure we are aren't we because yeah I think the last round in that game where I achieved that score was in Israel and I pretty sure it brought down the score 224 500 around that mark and the other one of course being the turkey one which I think was you know ten points off or something like that I can't quite remember but anyway might not matter because this is looking like a pretty pretty pretty hard round right surrender say which I believe exists in Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese rather we've got flashes of words on this sort of fading pasty sign here I think that's another say that looks like another renter great and then let let let Calais lo Calais probably means local I'm thinking Spanish out of the two so far which is bad really because that doesn't really narrow it down we look like we might have some possible Peruvian colors around lots of palm trees though so I'm thinking we might be a bit further north looks pretty damn tropical doesn't it to be honest I've been having Guatemala a hell of a lot especially on a diverse world I'm not so sure about an urban world you tell me matter if you're watching but you're very Guatemala heavy on you and you know it so yeah potential Peruvian colors there that is the Canadian Maple Leaf which is extremely confusing but I don't think we have any flags in this round let's look around look around yes yes it's tricky there's some decent cars here there's a bit of money little bit of money but this might be our best Oh plus a Senshi ow it's looking like Spanish isn't it god I hope there's nothing on here that I'm missing out it looks like there's a website at the bottom but I don't think I can see any sort of dot BR or dot anything I think if I if I did say I could if I did try and and see something I'd probably just be imagining imagining it really so yeah we've got to make a decision here could it be Peru well where's the Sun it's worth looking at the Sun in this round I think I don't think we're getting much Sun each are we really is it over there setting I can't see any shadows so if there's no shadows there ain't a Sun really is there oh man even that billboards really faded and illegible unreadable okay well we've got to make a guess and I am deliberating over this because I think we can most definitely beat the record here I might go for Guatemala these yellow curbs that I know are crucial they're just going to be crucial on there but I don't know all these cars look like they're driving on the left at least have parked on the left it might be a one-way street to be fair doesn't look like there's any signs though to indicate that this car is completely in the middle as is this one down here well he's kind of know they're on the right aren't they they're on the right but why is everyone parking on the left down here I guess that's the best side to park just thinking out loud guys really and postponing my inevitable guess lots of yellows and blues around man this is tough could be Columbia Ecuador so many places but I am going to go for Guatemala because I have been getting it a few times disproportionate amount of times recently and that might just be luck but the main reason that I'm going for it is because it's a small area of land and if I am there then I might just beat the record somehow without getting one single perfect score that would be quite a feat so I'm going for Guatemala and I'm not going to go in this in the capital instead I'm gonna go here I think I just don't know ah the maps even playing up now on the regular gameplay for some reason oh dear okay it's okay let's go they're really not hopeful about this really expecting this to be in South America in fact looking at that surely the Sun has set over there she's slightly to the north hmm that is making me think twice you know the Sun does look like it's coming from over there doesn't it but it's setting so surely if it was setting it would be directly in the West man oh man I don't know what to do okay I'm going for it come on come on don't do this don't do this to me you can't you can't crash now oh my god could not contact the server to make guess try again jesus wept I mean would you believe it come on I know it's not Guatemala just put me out my misery Jesus Wiz I give up man I give up trying I'm just gonna sit here and chill and let the gods decide oh it's loaded my god we weren't in Guatemala but we're actually in Mexico not that far away in this place I'm not gonna be able to really am I this it's gonna let me zoom in yes it is coat Zak Holocaust okay so I'm still not going to be able to read it I've never heard of it but it's in a pretty mad part of Mexico down there in that bay that has to go down as a good guess all things considered although it was two nine nine miles away view summary two three three oh one that's got to go down as a pretty good game all in all I'm pretty pleased with that one that wasn't too bad lots of you will have worked out that that was indeed Switzerland though the Thailand one was I mean that was lucky I just went for Bangkok because it had that pretty big city vibe about it lots of expensive buildings built by the government the Newcastle one I'm really proud of obscure literacy knowledge they're saving the day even though I'm awful if I was to do a pub quiz books would be last on the list along with art Catania was you know what we all knew it was Catania all of us that saw that clue but still within the realms of that a good guess and then that last one has to go down as possibly the best guess really I mean lots of you I believe would have gone for Columbia Ecuador possibly even Peru because I mean it had that tropical vibe I think Columbia would have been a popular one Costa Rica but well done if he said in Mexico and well done if you got nearer than me and mainly speaking well done if you beat that score because that's a pretty that's that's a whopper so genuinely well done if you've beaten me today I want to hear a full account of how you did it all your methods your ins and outs your ups and downs and yeah I will see you on Monday have a great weekend and I'm gonna leave a little comment on this video detailing plans of some upcoming video ideas that I am gonna carry out in the near future some of which inspired by you guys some of which my own ideas so check out that comment and as usual like the

"greetings everybody welcome back to my channel oh no sorry that was a bit weird wasn't it as a bit creepy I won't be doing that again but welcome back nonetheless and I am going to continue the quest today of trying to get a perfect score without moving I know I know it's mad it does sound mad but on certain formats such as an urban world it is it is possible because I've got three rounds that are perfect before and the other two I think I could have done and I think some of you did so I'm gonna continue that quest and without any further ado we're gonna get straight into it today so what am i doing I need to type in an urban world created by Maha there it is I am twing with the idea of playing an urban world or a diverse world with a three minute time limit just to see what kind of score I would get might be quite interesting and you guys have course could play along but here we go there's the link we need serious luck with these rounds starting with this one well this looks like it might be Asia yet well well let's look around let's look around cuz it could be the USA for all I know just had that vibe know it is Asia but we might get this we might get this because we have English writing I think it's Korea yo Chang Park station I guess electronics market 1-1 hi oh dang ping pong pang so there we go um what city are we in that's going to be key here without that we ain't gonna get it even with that information I would have thought this would be quite hard although we do have big buildings a railway track to our left what looks like quite a big sort of section of railway tracks and here yet all we've got is names all we've got is yeah we don't have a number of a road so this could be difficult and on top of that I don't even think we have we have that that could help leave we don't even have a city so I think what we do here is we go into Seoul because I think this could be Seoul it's pretty damn big and try and find hi Oh Chang Park station I think that's what we do in all reality get into Seoul and try and find that might take me a little while but wish me luck the names kind of do correlate I mean that might be the case for widespread across Korea but there's lots of dongs there's lots of gangs and hyung's just need hi Oh Chang or yo Chang whatever whatever you actually pronounce it but hang on we've got to be right in the middle where is the middle there's Gangnam Gangnam style I don't know whether that's you know the center I'm pretty sure that's the south isn't it so where is it where the Biggie's where the big buildings I think probably around here somewhere by the looks of it but maybe not it's very gappy I mean maybe here then maybe around here okay let's look around here I mean we might not be in Seoul that's the annoying thing hyojong also one higher is another one we're looking for one higher I think around this is also a key area very likely area ah hi Oh chang-dong got it okay right we found the area can we find the exact spot that we are I don't know hi Oh Chang wait hi Chun dong yeah okay hi Chang Park station is what we're looking for can we find that that's a whole different kettle of fish electronics market and wire what one hi oh he's straight on hang on I'm looking at it from the wrong angle here so we're facing north there okay so we're on a big road by a railway track and higher chang-dong he's back behind us to the left so where is it again where have you gone where have you gone lost it no it's here isn't it it's by this park is it gone what was it this Park yes this bar okay so we could be up here if you think about it we have a railway track yes yes we have a railway track straight down was the electronics market apparently but I'm not so sure that would be on the map no perhaps not I'm just kind of looking for one one hi oh but I can't find that never mind I'm thinking we are here alongside this railway track to be honest in the road it does been round doesn't it so I'm thinking we are sort of here can we find this then leave I don't know whether that would be on the map I really don't hi and I blew I mean I can look at shapes of buildings we're right next to the track that's the thing we are right next to the track so we've got to find a road that is literally next to the track and this one is kind of the only one I can think that is really even then that's not no it's not so I want to head down ah this one is this one's right next to it so okay yeah yeah I'm liking that and I blue hands yeah I think we're probably more down here can we get a street name over here I can't really we want tall buildings and then we want that bridge yes okay I forgot about all this geographical features yeah yeah that does that does correlate so that would put us my friends my loyal supporters that would put us there in my eyes so I'm gonna I'm gonna go for that thirty five point nine meters excellent stuff 5,000 points on them around well an Asian round I don't think I've ever got a perfect score without moving on an agent Rand and if I have then I've totally forgot about it but that was quite something I'm pretty proud of that and that is one out of five for a perfect score but at any moment our God were in Asia again any moment likelihood is you're gonna get around that you ain't gonna be able to get right can we get this this is gonna be even harder right kenta-kun net I think we're in oh wow we have a little map there that is handy uh hey uh dot kenta-kun net our man if only it said what city we were in we're in Japan I think pretty sure of that are we gonna get the city Asahi god damn okay this is gonna be virtually impossible to be honest to get so perfect score hopes might be over but um like any of these could be the city any of these little words but it's just let me just real my head forward it's really frustrating because that's one of the best signs you'll ever get in Japan just can't decipher it what about this mmm it's all in Japanese for some reason so it's it's tricky just thinking it's tantalizing isn't it this one but in reality I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it Yoshida that's just a name problem I have is that I don't know which word would be the city and searching the map for a bunch of symbols that my brain just isn't used to is more than likely a complete waste of time especially when you consider that even if I found what I thought was the city the right one the chance of me finding this street I mean what am I going on there's no it's just a grid street I mean if we were in Tokyo absolutely no chance absolutely no chance so yeah I'm just gonna have to I wonder if Ken Taku is is a place you have a quick look for Ken Taku I love a look a minute for a minute for Ken Taku I've never heard of it but it's have a quick look and if I can't find that okay where does it look like the south of Japan or the north well the sun is shining and so chances are further south if I can find Ken Taku I will be absolutely ecstatic because presumably it will be a small place relatively small small enough hopefully for me to be able to find this street I mean sounds pretty mad and I think it is I think the chance of me doing all of that is extremely slim but you never know [Music] okay that's me done I'm just gonna guess down here I think soon as it's quite sunny and I'll go that's quite a hilly town that is I'm gonna change my towns and I'm gonna go to Okayama that'll do I wasn't a queer okay I'm gonna wait for that bug to end after 10 seconds and I'm gonna look in Nagoya see if there was an area called ken Taku if there is that's really annoying because I actually scanned into Nagoya God I don't think I would have ever found that and I don't think there's an area there called Ken Taku so that wasn't a place it was just you know some sort of something else a name a company something like that so never mind 175 miles isn't too bad but the perfect score dream is crushed third round well done if you're keeping up school wise now this looks like Britain yellow number plates driving on the left but it looks like quite a historic place I don't know all of the phone telephone codes there's just too many I had to go up trying to learn them but East Claremont Street this looks like it could be possibly somewhere in Scotland Glasgow or something like that potentially used to Claremont Street Arnold Clark you get those all over the country East Claremont Bellevue Terrace yeah this could be Edinburgh or Scotland that's mainly judging on the buildings these sort of stone sandy grey stone buildings is this going to give so clue jhc I don't think it is yeah I don't think there's any better clues now Evening News over there if we could get the surname there you know if it was like Marie or McGwire well McGuire's more Irish Boyd something like that Patterson Hamilton names like that then we could go our yeah it's got to be Scotland but I'm just a bit worried that this is Bristol or something okay really far away from Scotland but I've got to go with my hunch and I'm gonna say that we're in Glasgow because that was my first hunch wasn't it so let's go I'm not going to spend ages looking for Bellevue Terrace I would if we were still on a perfect school I'd waste another 20 minutes doing that but I'm not gonna do that I'm just gonna go there fingers crossed that this is indeed Glasgow not Edinburgh I was Edinburgh of course it was yeah in my mind I was kind of flipping a coin with us weather is Bovril as to whether I should go for Edinburgh or Glasgow but luckily there are only 40 10.9 miles apart and 234 points so Wow work that out quick I'm usually really shared maths so yeah the score overall is pretty damn good well done if anyone went for Edinburgh there you've outdone me fourth round oh this is gobby Britain again isn't it we've got white number plates on the front but it's just these buildings I mean if this house here doesn't belong to a woman called Pat then I'll eat my hat they're the most British buildings I've ever seen like you just wouldn't get I don't know what it is about them maybe it's the roof maybe it's the the chimneys it could be a mixture of things but they're just not Dutch or anything like that let's move around I say that I might be wrong yeah yellow number place on the white on the front as far as I know the only country to have that combination Portsmouth City Council Mountjoy coat UK Westminster place do you know I was driving through Portsmouth not long ago or was it Southampton notice Portsmouth and there's a massive jumble of these kinds of buildings down towards where you get the ferry you drive past them we got the ferry to the Isle of Wight for work and was it Portsmouth yeah it was and so we got the pho from down here and I think they were either along here or they were further up no they were there would have been down here somewhere let's see if we can try and find them hugest a anyone from Portsmouth will know exactly what I'm talking about I think this is it here can you see these two lines Estella Road I can only imagine it's pretty rough state but I can only see one one building that looked like those so Westminster place let's see if we can find that is it gonna tell us I don't think it is is it either way we're not there because there's only one of them and it's going from North it's it's going in a different kind of direction isn't it so but we might be nearby let's just hope we're nearby to that and let's go hmm let's just go around here somewhere yeah run here he goes nothing that's not a million miles away is it Oh God okay seven hundred and ninety yards two hundred seven hundred and twenty-two meters is it gonna let me zoom in now yes it is so there's the estate that I was talking about it's not too far away it's it's a stone's throw away so I'm pretty happy with that and if you zoom out yeah that's a pretty good guess Wow 4 997 I've got to be happy with that haven't I really right last round will everything crumble here on the last round let's look around quite possibly we haven't got much to go on here we can can we beat the record no we can't we can't beat the record the record is 24,500 so no no way and how can we be that right now it all the cars are parked on the left on both sides so you would think that we've been australia judging by that the other place could be New Zealand but doesn't look like New Zealand it's too tropical but we've got to think of other countries that potentially well that do drive on the left they could potentially look like this you've got some of the Asian countries like Thailand Philippines now I think they drive on the right but Malaysia is one of them but these cars look pretty brand spanking don't they so I'm thinking this has to be Australia I don't think it could be South Africa although we do have driveways that are fenced off so possibly but I don't think South Africa is this palm tree really I'm not getting a South African vibe that says SEMS scepter cm scepter what else have we got on the graffiti just can't read and can you some of the font is so outlandish right black bins with red tops yeah we're not getting a great deal here I think I'm just gonna have to go with my hunch and say that we're in Australia mate and then I'm gonna be really wild today seeing as you know we can't get any sort of record I'm gonna say that we're in Perth I feel like there's palm trees down there no wait wait wait yeah I'm doing it I'm going for Perth at the risk of getting a woeful score you know if it if it is you know Brisbane or something like that we're going to get about 400 points because I've done it before but I'm gonna go for it I'm just gonna go for Perth and I'm gonna go up here I could really regret this good night here we go oh my word well it wasn't 400 points but it was 756 we were actually in Darwin should have really gone for that and I think a lot of you Aziz will have done that and beat my overall score in the process by going for Darwin I think I can I can sort of rest assure that I wouldn't have gone for Darwin because I've never had it before I would have just gone for probably somewhere over here like Rockhampton or Cannes or something which would have been better let's face it but anyway let's view this summary it's a shame that we couldn't get a perfect score but thinking about it we probably well we definitely couldn't have done it really that Darwin won was just impossible those two very much gettable weren't they those two but a Wandsworth uh-huh but it's irrelevant because that Japan round the second round would have taken me roughly four years to complete with a perfect score right guys well done if you beat my school or got anywhere near it please feel free to leave me your little logs of how you did especially if you beat me I don't know how you did it how you achieved that greatness quick update on what's to come monday will be another ferocious attempt at ten country challenge trying to get that ten or beat that ten Wednesday will be hometown roulette and over the coming months you can expect to see some of those big hitting videos that I was talking about in that comment a couple of weeks ago you know worst guesses compilation funny moments compilation insane guesses ten state challenge things like that for you all to enjoy and the editing for the mission across Wales trip still slow but getting there in the meantime everyone hope you have a top weekend don't do anything I wouldn't do ya see in

"hello and welcome back to the channel everyone it is Friday we've all had a bloody we've all worked our asses off this week most of us and now it's time to have fun in the form of a play along game but one that I've never I've never done before and it was inspired by one of you people one of you lovely people was gonna use a different word then but you you're lovely lovely people and that's the end of it and it's a diverse world three minutes per round and I think the reason this is called four is well I don't think I've moved in in I don't think I've moved I mean I've moved off this seat to go to the toilet and whatnot but I'm geoguessr I don't think I've actually moved since up UK perfect school months ago absolutely months ago which is mad so it will feel strange but I just think it will be nice to you know get a score what's the high score I can get in three minutes and you know see if you can beat it basically you know just the normal style of playing how well can I do and can you beat me and if so by how much right three minutes is set next copy start challenge this is going to be strange he's gonna be unfamiliar for me oh right here we go god this fit I feel free feel like I've been unshackled I really do from years of torture hidden entrance whoo that's not going to help us though are we driving on the right or the left where's the Sun I'm still gonna do you standard things Sun is in the south so we are in the northern hemisphere I think this is the USA and I'm gonna go this way so yeah I think this is us a time is a factor here of obviously three minutes around I think it's a nice quick snappy time you know obviously I'm not going to get a perfect score here but what score can I get I mean can I get a perfect score who knows but I'm just waiting for well I'm hoping for a junction a sign perhaps with a state the moment I reckon we're possibly in in somewhere like God why am I going in on the map now I can't even remember the States possibly somewhere like New Mexico maybe Colorado maybe Utah maybe even Arizona somewhere like that but it doesn't really narrow it down they're all big chunks of land but this way nothing as of yet no clues and I'm moving quite quick with my new internet relatively new internet this is quicker than I would have been moving back at mother's house we've got one minute left now and no clue just what we can see around us should I have gone the other way it's always the thought many of you will have gone the other way roughly half of you will it be that half of you that succeed who bear fruit from this or will it be my half nice Big River their land looks quite green I mean that could be to do with the river the fertile land of the the floodplain mmm man thirty seconds left this is not good I'm thinking Utah possibly even Montana or something like that this is not ideal though 20 seconds left my god are we coming to something here come on come on you never know ten seconds this is ridiculous okay I'm going Utah I think five seconds left there we go we were in Colorado latitude as always amazing two hundred and thirty five point eight miles you know that's all right that's pretty good it's pretty pretty good zooming out there one state over nothing to be ashamed of well done if you picked me though well done if you went for Colorado I think you would have less you went right down here which would be pretty stupid because that's in the plains then that you will have beat me so well done next round okay we've got clues here for sure we have definitely got clues we've got a sign here okay s Quint la quinta la 23 kilometers we are probably in South America Guatemala straight on and we're heading kind of south which I'm glad about because that means we are in Mexico and there's the flag to prove it so hmm Pauline Guatemala just nonchalantly on a sign there let's see I mean can we find a place called Pauline I wonder is it too early to be going on them on the map probably grata Garrity's deep a pat pays you pay hey I don't know what that is right okay I think I'm going in I think what am I looking for then do I get that I think I get the road name don't I I think I've got to get the road name quite indecisive here God he looks tiny look at this bloke how does he look so small maybe it's just a bigger road than I thought and I'm wasting so much time here here we go here's a road name isn't it no that's a speed limit oh man look I'm not moving very far on this road which is really annoying so I'm gonna just have to have a look on the map see if I can find that's not go tomorrow anymore that's belly's so down here then he's where I'm looking and I've totally forgot what it was called black we go to the start my god okay back to this sign he was popping or something wasn't it Palin one letter off so I'm looking for Palin will I find it with 47 seconds to go I'm so sure that I will could would be on this road look at that damn he's not going to plan where the hell is Palin how far could it be from Guatemala oh I've got 20 seconds now sheet could be further up where's Palenque 10 seconds I think we're up there okay I'm gonna go down here somewhere I think there oh it's the city isn't it the city of Guatemala how stupid I mean luckily only 143 miles away so it's a bigger point hall than the first round but my word how stupid Guatemala City of course but wait we had a Mexican flag that's what made me think Mexico that wasn't the Guatemalan flag haha man was that a Mexican restaurant that is a joke or was it a local flag the s squint Allah ask to remember that the s quintella flag ah man and there it is look there's the town of a squint ler again feelings could have been better couldn't it but you know still a good points all well done if you are still ahead of me right next round it's looking like South America again the Sun is over there and it's kind of kind of northern obviously mainly Western right let's move around for once we can move around in one of these these rounds these South American rounds so used to being stuck Avenida Sewer meaning South I think Cali pond into something Guatemala right can we figure out our town we're in Guatemala again would you believe it I told you mapa loves Guatemala he loves putting it in there right can we figure out the town I wonder if we were in a Sikh winter or whatever it was called right let's move down we might get it clear if they're a proud town they will be showing off the name of the town I think somewhere Avenida sewer again lovely little square here San Antonio I've seen San Antonio and San Martin so Mariposa Mariposa no I don't know if that's a place is it do we look in the map we haven't got time that's the thing it rings a bell that word rings a bell but it's it's whether that is a place or a word that I've seen before this is a lovely town by the way it has to be said there is the flag of Guatemala is that the flag that I saw in the first round man okay I'm just gonna spend another 45 seconds I think trying to figure out which town we're in we know we're in Guatemala here we go what's this man can we get closer to that yes a bit a bit La Antigua Guatemala yeah Mooney Mooney see pally dad dear La Antigua I think it says it's getting there there it is Antigua Guatemala found it it's really close to where we were in the last round actually and the mountains did look they do look very similar right can we get this spot on where's the town is that the park no because that's not other leader sewer crap I'm going back I'm going back it's a look at the compass we were heading north weren't we where is that Town Square there it is Avenida sewer eight seconds left I'm going there [ __ ] that ah what our God's sake there's hundreds of avenida sewers okay I'm only two points off there but that's kind of annoying because there's two avenida sewer three avenida sewer five avenida saw hundreds might be a slight exaggeration there is the the park for some reason i thought i'd come at it from an easterly direction in actual fact i'd come at it from the south so that's quite probably quite frustrating for you lot to watch unless you are trying to beat me which many of you are but you would have only beaten me by two points even if you were spot-on nonetheless well done if you were four ninety nine eight points i got some of you will have got that i think if you'd have got into that square on time so yeah this is a good score we're racking up here i think a decent one anyway right we're gonna build a barrier again she's quite urban it's more like an urban world round and i think we've got a sign over here let's have a look Cagliari carbonia now Cagliari is that my brains going a bit numb here is that in yes it is in Sardinia there it is and carbonia is there so could we be in a little town in between the two look we've got a police station here policia locale hmm it's not going to tell us where we are a don't think Paulo TM when you see Bali come on no we are not going to get the town there I think that's a bit optimistic so let's I guess Cagliari and carbonia are both that way we might not be in between the two to be fair it could be the place called bass clue it's replaced called bass clue is it wise to try and look for a place called bass Kalu when we've got a minute and a half left quite probably not really although there are places ending in you so it is tempting Oh God scared the [ __ ] out of me right okay certainly haven't got time to be answering calls let's head down here I'm aware that I've got one minute left we have another sign here right colour setter colour setter where is that I can't see that color set aids there hmm surely we're not on that island are we zona Arco Logica color setter is that way surely we were around here Porto baate yeah I don't know and I'm very aware that some of you are gonna you're gonna work this out Basilica Centro Fontaine man just tell us where we are here we go surely this is enough 25 seconds left spiash that's the sea Guardia man no clue no clue as to where we are man okay I'm gonna go here [ __ ] okay right that'll do we were on the island of Cala cetera I'm just going to wait for the bug to to cease a color set or ease up there look that is oh my god come on give me a break right so callous Etta is a town on this island of San Tan toyoko I thought for some reason that that was the island Calais Etta but actually we were in the town of Santa santan T oka just to make it even more confusing but luckily I clicked only 3.4 miles away just across the sea there so yeah I've got to be really pleased with that really 15 points dropped so you know it's it's it ain't many it's insignificant amounts really in the grand scheme of things you know we're not on for a perfect score or anything so last round now can we keep this up we're driving on the right here so it's not mind you it's all one way so we could be in Australia or New Zealand we stuck on the path for the time being Banco Nacional no we're probably not in New Zealand or Australia can we get off this godforsaken path or not are we in Guatemala again surely not surely not it does he does I have that vibe doesn't it man okay I am well and truly stuck on this path for the time being it does remind me of rounds rounds of the past that have been in Costa Rica Guatemala USA that's confusing any flags there's so many clues around here surely dotnet that's not helpful so much to look at here definitely not in the USA on account of the Spanish writing get off the path what is wrong what are you doing mapper please don't give me these rounds well this is really annoying I'm going back to the start and una hora mass right I can go in here apparently that's great yeah really useful I can't believe this just stuck on the path Cleveland I've got one minute left this is a joke entrada haha man ok right just haven't found any clues that are like giving away what country we are in Tapia still nothing so de Tapia contact eros she's a joke man this is a real joke I'm just gonna whiz down here I've got 30 seconds left are there any clip are Costa Rica flag ok so is that an airport over there it looks secure dad Alfa I've got to go into the map I've got 15 seconds left there's a Costa Rica flag I'm going San Jose I'm sure there's an airport up here somewhere I'm going with 5 seconds left there fingers crossed oh it's not bad 2.5 miles Wow so it was just a flag there that did it in terms of actual areas I have we were by an airport no that's where I clicked apparently I had no idea I was doing that but we were right in the middle of Costa Rica the the capital San Jose by a park I don't know what it was that I thought was Airport ish about that but I cannot be I cannot be displeased with that four nine eight nine view summary twenty-three thousand four hundred and sixty nine dropping of points were in the USA and that's it all of the others were we're here weren't they yeah it was just this one that we dropped a few more points on Guatemala Mexico guess it was a very Central American affair wasn't it very much sir with a bit of Sardinia throned in throned in tell me what you thought of that format everyone please that would be much appreciated and also tell me how you did tell me if you beat me tell me if you had any bizarre encounters did I miss anything royally that you that was glaringly obvious that you picked up on did you get any insane guesses let me know yeah I will do that again if you all enjoyed it next not probably not next week though because there is business to attend to in terms of an urban world you know I'm still hell-bent on getting a perfect score without moving so that it's definitely an ongoing thing but Fridays are gonna be split up into various things I might do at no moving scrolling or zooming as well at some point guys thanks so much for dedicating your Friday evening to watching my video and I will see you very soon on Monday where I will get 11 countries in a row I swear by it I can't swear I can't swear by Akana said that last week I'll see you then though take care have a great weekend tada ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 39.53824771521786, "lng": -107.60348693471383}, {"round": 2, "lat": 14.41076377089546, "lng": -90.68668649617047}, {"round": 3,

"hello and welcome back everyone to well something that we haven't done in far too long to be honest an urban world no moving around chances for greatness and it came in the form of this school not too long ago but still chances of a perfect score I don't think I'll get it today because it's been far too long since I've done this bit out of practice but you have the chance to play along with the game follow the instructions in the description and try and beat my score it's one of the funnest things we do on this channel let's make the challenge and let's embark on this urban adventure let's see what crops up today okay hey yes okay here we go Robert Robin Robertson Robinson Street is where we are we're driving on the left I couldn't help but notice Sun directly in the north so we're talking oh look at that as well damn I feel like I should know where that is that in Joburg st. in Johannesburg I know there is a sort of similar structure to that note we're in Sydney there's the proof East Sydney private hospital so it looks like then folks we're gonna get this one spot on I don't see why not some some sort of disaster would would have to happen for us not to get this let's get right in there into Sydney it's not waste any time and East Sydney so by the sea I would have thought or at least towards that sort of way there's North Sydney what's considered East Sydney is it that I wouldn't have thought so all the thought it's sort of this neck of the woods around here looking for a hospital could that be it now that's some Vincent's private hospital East Sydney Wiese have another look at that just a refresh East Sydney private hospital so it is a private hospital could it be that one some Vincent's private hospital I wouldn't have thought so because it's you know just straight up a different name isn't it but so let's just keep looking a little while let's keep scanning for more hospitals they do stick out pretty clearly don't like walpert Jewish Hospital interesting hospital only for Jews seems Oh Prince of Wales Hospital no we'll get there I'm sure we do need to be in the East though East Sydney private hospital could it be over here if not we'll have to start looking at other clues in fact I think I'm gonna start looking at other clues we have a sign over here look at that Sydney and something it's well it's a tour bus isn't it so we can't be too far out by my reckoning Kings Cross vowel Clues William Street can't read that one Kings Cross file Clues let's try and find those areas then soon as we can't find the hospital King's Cross can we find that are we up here let's have a quick look up here just just to you know get it out the way Oh matter hospital Royal North Shore Hospital Greenwich Hospital Wow a plethora of hospitals up there but not the one we're looking for right let's get down here then I'm gonna zoom out a little bit there's King's Cross just south of lulululu which is an incredible name and so surely here with Kings Cross in view there's William Street surely now we're closing in on the hospital it's just as it happens it's just not being advertised at all what street is this yeah okay okay King's Cross William Street we haven't got the the name of this road we have got Robinson Street however so let's look out for that William Street William Street okay we've got to be around here somewhere there's Robinson Street there it is the hospital is just not on there it's not on the map which is crazy we've got that Jenny bromberger that's not no that's not a hospital so if we really carried on looking for that we just wouldn't have found it at all so we're on parma street that's crazy isn't it I have to say private hospital just not on the map whatsoever okay we are here we're on parma street where's the bridge down there is it worth even looking for it yes I guess it is but we're by Robinson Street so that's that let's go there here we go seven point one meters bit careless there a bit sloppy but we know full well that we've got a cushion a safety net of a hundred meters so first round is a perfect score oh how I want that to continue for the next four rounds oh how I want that to happen is it gonna happen chances are very slim but you never know let's continue right well this looks okay I'm not I'm gonna say no more but it looks okay let's have a look it's a look at the languages we can see Disneyland 25 super super Roy super Roy what is that am i seeing that right is that super roll is that French could well be let's look around a bit more blue sides URI and then we've got Jesus there dying on the cross yep that's all there is to it let's have a look over here uni credits now here we go that looks Italian it'll do Oh five times a thousand VAT Dorito Alec koala okay to me that seems pretty Italian and there there it is attenzione a definitely it's a Lia now can we figure out what city we are int there's a metro this could be Milan couldn't if it is we might struggle because it's a huge city here we go look at this now I'm going to reel my head forward a little bit stat dude oh okay these are all car parking spaces so not the best thing but you never know that might be what we have to call upon we have a street name Largo la popa la Gola papa good stuff so we have the necessary clues along with this distinctive looking square to find out where we are in this city we just need to find out which city we're in that's the thing so I'm just looking around here just to see if I can find any clue what I did see over here which might be of some use where is it look at that is that one of the lakes in the northern Lake District you know Lake Como is it is that Manoj EO I've actually been to that place and it reminds me of it a lot I'll show you on the map quickly those of you don't know haven't heard of it there's a series of lakes up here in the foothills of the Alps that's a huge one that's Lake Garda never been to that one and then you've got this one which is Lake Como which I try to I try to kayak up it in an inflatable kayak it didn't really work I'll tell you about that another time but manoj EO is that that could be what we're looking at if so we would be or we would i would strongly thought we'd be in Milan it also looks like Milan to me modern buildings lots of money you know there's clearly money here however I think we're gonna need more than that statute Oh San Marco so I can look for those in Milan might take me a little while piazza castello could that be where we are does that say love brand best outlet does it say Milan doesn't I'm just gonna scan for any more clues that I can hotel and then if I can't find anything I'm gonna get back on the map and start start looking in Milan no what's that what's that we're getting anything there I only scanned it earlier no okay I think it's time for me guys to start looking in Milan which is where I suspect that we are now if I can't find any of these places then we've got something to worry about but let's have a look okay this might take me a little while but we have the Metro we've got to think it can't really be a smaller a small city we're definitely not in the south of Italy for a start I would go as far as say we're definitely not but it's also could have a metro so you know it's only it's only going to be a few cities ok let's start looking then so I'm looking for stat odo San Marco and then that what does that say I Bertie al Oh Bertie yeah ok so I'm looking for car parking spaces this is a bit desperate but let's have a look we're also buy a tube station Duomo Castel oh is that where we are piazza castello if we literally found it it's not a roundabout is it so I would have thought not Stella I've been to Milan and it's bringing back memories right can we get the name of the Metro we can't PST cats Stella Costello mm-hmm why can't we get the name of the Metro I don't know but we can't okay back to the car parking spaces then it might be that I have to speed this up folks okay what I'm gonna do actually is go into all of these metro stations and see if we can find the junction this is a big distinctive looking junction which might be easier to find than the car parking spaces wait aapko are parking which is but which is a better option to do I'm gonna look for the car parking spaces actually because they can't be that many of them so I'm going to do that we will get there ah look at that Auto si lo San Marco there so we're not too far from there that is to the south apparently so could we be there mosque over I would say that we could do we have the street name laughs Appa was it laughs Appa yeah it is it's not it's not the popper it's laughs Appa so we found it we are here amazing I can't believe it that was such a good way to work it out so we are at miskova metro station on this big Junction here incredible wasn't even sure that we're in Milan it was just a hunch let's make our guess nine point four meters away even less than last time but who cares incredible starts of this game with two perfect score rounds let's carry on come on come on come on okay this looks harder but you never know you never know look at that jay-ar Tacna okay L lage Oh what is this J are tacna Wow okay there are clues here there are definitely clues it reminds me of rounds that I've had in Peru I would say that this is almost definitely Peru let's have a look here are there's so much I don't know where to look there's so much going on Oh God okay can we get one of these website one of these addresses I've got that there we just can't read that I can't read it okay never mind let's keep moving on J are tacna v Quadra so that's the road we're on jr. attack know something something la go hmm okay let's keep looking for clues I've got to scan everything here to that millennium why I tablet us hmm yeah it definitely can't read that what about this salon spa Geraldine no I don't think we can read any of this just looking at all these signs this is our best hope come on what's that jr. tacna n something-something it's not good enough is it okay starting to think this is all we're gonna get I think come on let's keep looking desperate this is the problem I'm desperate to keep this run going I've got Hills there to the South look at that that's a really good sign for us to say something meanest away go I don't even know for sure whether away whether we're in Peru or Bolivia okay forgive me while I just scan everything I've got to scan everything [Music] okay right so that's our only clue then along with just great geographical features which tell us sort of how big or small the town is it doesn't look too big but junior tacna is the street name something something L Lego I'm gonna go into the map and search my life away for this place something something L lage oh I wonder if that is the area the the sort of County if you like and is it referring to the Lake Titicaca let's have a look at some of the thing about puno arequipa okay it's there a place called something la go that's all I can look for I don't even know if we're in Bolivia or not that's the problem or if we could be in like puno or something it's quite a big place hmm yeah the chance of us finding this are so small what do i do what do i do what do I do la go arequipa we can't be an area keeper can we surely not who knows I'm just gonna have one more look guys on here for a close this is desperate and if not I'm just got to make a guess what about this guy's newspaper eDoc toe yeah I can relate to that trow May I don't know about that yours I'm gonna search for more clues I've got to do it I can't let this slide [Music] okay guys I'm gonna get in on the map and look in certain cities v Quadra might do it for me so I'm gonna search a couple of cities I won't bore you with it I'll speed it up when I think suitable but I'm basically just gonna search it loads of cities because I want to get this okay here we go [Music] right here's the deal guys I found within the city of what's it called again Julius ax or juliaca a Bloody ell I've lost it where is it there it is a street called tacna okay tacna the junior I presume is just you know short for road or whatever but it's completely the wrong direction it's running from east to west you know albeit slightly northeast this is not though this is just you know basically north to south this road that we're on so it can't be that so you know while my eyes lit up straight away I was soon kind of put back in my place but and by the way the reason I'm checking around here is because I just think L lage oh it's the only I think we're in Peru and I just think the lake the lake that would be the light that they're talking about Titicaca so then I had to look in puno this place here and I've found another tacna here it is look and I think we're here because wait a minute I think we actually are here what was this hospice hospedaje yeah there I've gone and found it so we are there we have to be is there a mounting up there or a hill over in this direction I guess that could be quite far away and yet that could be there and then Hills down the bottom end which we also have yeah I mean they're quite far away too could Lake Titicaca be over there I guess it could I'm going for it oh my god I don't believe I've found that this is incredible this is going so incredibly well three out of five gotten as if I found that one as well bloody hell let's move on fourth round we have a perfect score thus far let's have a look what do we have here Jara Seeger adore okay that sounds Icelandic sounds like an Icelandic name op team ah we have a flag but it's an optimal flag still form okay we're in Iceland definitely Hillier is he sold yeah did it okay oh my God look at this what is that I don't think I can read those maybe I can use those later on down the line but at the moment I can't really read them which is devastating surely though we are in and around Reykjavik we have to be what's that again can't read it we've got to be near Reykjavik in fact I think I could find this road even without being able to read the the road signs because Reykjavik isn't the biggest place let's have a go let's get in there surely we can get this surely oh my god this is exciting it may all hinge on the last round but less get ahead of ourselves okay so we could be on one of these roads here look at this one see how it bends round there we could be here so look at the way the whole road looks go straight down doesn't it okay bear in mind we're looking for okay we can't see what that is still form Isolde we can look for those as soon as we think we found where we are we can keep an eye out for them at least could we be there don't think so let's have a look at other junctions there's an airport could we be here I don't think so because we okay maybe maybe it's just gonna be a case of me searching again at various junctions which one didn't I look at oh my god I'm looking at it the wrong way that's north Jesus I'm getting so ahead of myself here that I've haven't even considered which way is which I'm still confident that we're in and around Reykjavik right do we have C in any direction is that the C I don't think it is okay that's north right so there has to be a built-up area with a hill to the north so it can't be C I've got to think about this it's quite built up up there this is also a big dip isn't there it's like a valley almost so we could be looking at hmm I think I've just got to keep scanning for different areas that correlate yeah let me think let me think the best way to go about this in order to get this quicker rather than not so quicker okay what's this graph are vague or I can sort of read that now when I've actually thought about it so brava vague or Easter a head north okay okay I might have to have a minute of alone time and speed this up guys because the pressure is just too much okay wish me luck okay guys I've had a good hard look and I just it's infuriating to be honest I can't find anywhere that really matches up to this using using all the information that's around me of which there is quite a lot that's the annoying thing I've taken into account the hill over there the built-up Ness of that bit that bit this factory to our right or left whichever way we're facing these buildings over here the big Junction and I just haven't found anything that adds up that much this area here it either says brah fog of fog or or gee graph graph will go for fog or what Jesus Christ either way I found that area it's here look graph are for Gore so I've picked a place that looks vaguely like it I'm going here and that's all I can do I don't think for one minute this is right but here we go here's my guess ah it's right I don't believe it I do not believe that I mean that just didn't add up for a start there was a path down here and there isn't one on the map none of these buildings had anything correlating at all I couldn't see this motorway it must have been going under the road nothing added up there really also we were looking at a fairly big mountain which I wasn't really sure about cuz of all the presence of sea but we must have been looking at this hill here oh my god this is the most crazy game ever let's play the last round my word moment of truth what have we got here can we get a perfect score surely not surely we can't get this Davis that's my name don't wear it out I mean seems like we're driving on the right this guy is having a Kip definitely having a sleep there we're driving on the right we're not going to have to get this our way oh why East 12th Street and what does that say at the top bear with me it says Lord Highland east 12th street east 12th street Wow okay I think we're in the USA here what registration plates have we got can you imagine if I somehow worked out where we are based on the registration plates oh my word wait a minute it would have to be one that I have studied haven't studied them all what is that it's just like a sky-blue one isn't it Davis rx home health care Cedar Manor we ain't going to get we ain't gonna get the town are we here we're just not gonna get it that is crushing but I mean it's only a matter of time wasn't it before I got around that didn't offer all the clues I can't believe I got that last round and the round before to be honest right where does this look like where does it look like East 12th Street I don't how long it would take me to find that just based on that Lord Highland I'm just going to rear my head forward once more yeah we we haven't got anything have we're here East 12th Street come after go in there and just have a good go Davis our ex what's our ex could that give a clue as to the town probably not but it's our last glimmer of hope so I think I've got to try and use it but can't think of a city or town with our X in it to be quite honest with you man RX I think we're fairly far up north can we find a town with our X in it not we know that we're not in New York because of the lack of yellow number plates how far south could we be just looking at these ridges I don't think I can get anything from these ridges a little yellow bit at the bottom what was that from I think that could be a on many plates to be honest that yellow thing at the bottom okay time to give up the ghost then so Lord Highland our x-man I mean the RX might not stand for anything but I'm just gonna have a look around the north for a town that has an Rx in it [Music] I'm just wondering what state we could actually be in based on these registration plates I I think I'm just a bit deflated at the moment so now I'm gonna get it but is there any mileage in trying to rule out certain states what does the say on the side of this car Montana Oh surely not I don't think that's linked to the state that were in this doesn't really look like Montana or any way to be honest does it that's snow up there could we be in Canada quite possibly guys to be honest it's a bit of a mess this okay I'm just gonna pick a random town this is really sad that it's coming to an end like this I'm still desperately searching for town with our X in it it's towns with X's in Lennox Sioux Falls oh okay we're not in New York are we so I'm not gonna go in New York am I going Pennsylvania now I'm gonna go I'm gonna go in Vermont I think it's goin Vermont and I will go okay I'm gonna go all gusta this is totally wrong but screw it here goes nothing oh my god Vancouver what a way to end look at that north of Vancouver there it is East 12th Street what can I say it's a shame it ended like that but my god let's get things into perspective here look at that up until that last round incredible for perfect school rounds in a row Sydney was easy let's face it Milan needed working out and as for the the the next to Iceland and Peru incredible hey I mean yeah um well let me know guys how was that for you did you enjoy it as much as I did in fact I didn't enjoy it at all it was incredibly stressful and you could probably tell so apologies for that but yeah I don't know what to say just an incredible journey really up until that last round but it was bound to happen really the odds of getting five gettable rounds is so slim but I must stress they need getting they do need getting and if you have got any decent amount of clues you can get them if you spend long enough right guys I want to see you comment in force I want to see how you fared on that game that incredible game who got four rounds like I did maybe you just got the first round and the others you struggled did anyone get the last round maybe if you're from Vancouver you got the last round maybe if you're from Vancouver and you're also a whiz kid at geoguessr you got them all please let me know comment in your forces and don't forget to hit the like button too if you did like it of course let me know what you want to see on Monday it's insane guesses four or I don't know ten state challenge I think I know what you're gonna pick see you there on Monday folks Wow I think I need a rest have a great weekend everyone ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -33.87392874121213, "lng": 151.2173057075321}, {"round": 2, "lat": 45.47789176637652, "lng": 9.184466089968623}, {"round": 3, "lat":

"welcome back to the channel everyone and to your weekly dose of geo guesser fun whilst i am hard at work editing the latest mission um yeah it's going well the editing it's going to be a great series i hope it's worth the wait for you so hang in there um yeah we're on schedule for a pre-christmas release date so all is good on that front meanwhile it's going to be another play-along video for you guys to enjoy and this is one that i i did do a while ago and it got a fair amount of views 600 000 views on the channel so i think it's high time i did another one and it's called interesting photo spheres in obscure countries yeah one round in particular springs to mind i was sure we were in a spanish city so i was scouring the coast of spain turns out we were in a huge algerian city that i'd never heard of so let's hope that there's more surprising intriguing and interesting photo spheres like that today let's play it no moving no time limit let's do it where are we going to pop out today okay here we go it okay is that okay it was taken by a dude called jean-pierre garcia and i can't really escape the names in the bottom right i mean my eyes will just be drawn to it i'm wondering if this is palmyra i don't know but palmyra springs to mind i remember it on top gear when jeremy james and hamster drove i can't quite remember that they drove they made their own race track or something or they drove around here but of course since then palmyra was destroyed by those buggers isis so i don't know whether this whether this is palmyra but this photo sphere predates that which is i think unlikely because that probably got destroyed in about 2014 or this isn't palmyra in which case i don't really know where it would be if truth be told but it could easily be a roman structure in anywhere palestine israel turkey but the people we're seeing i think i'm muslim yeah yeah i think so it's hard to say i mean that's a headscarf a muslim attire i think but that doesn't mean we're not in palestine jordan even so let's i'm going to go into palmyra if i can find it which i think is in syria again i i do have to point out that i am well not only did i have a few beers on the weekend so my head's a bit cloudy anyway but i'm not playing a lot of geoguesser i'm only editing so it's a total i'm using it as a get out of jail card if i do anything embarrassing geography wise um anyway so where's palmyra basically i bet i won't find it will i there's damascus i mean where is it i don't know where it is might have to speed this up got it okay it's in the middle of nowhere there it is there is a town around here you know there's there's normal buildings which we do have let's have a look at this then so according to this the town is slightly to the north of the of whatever you would call this and there's mountains in the north as well do we have mountains yes we do uh but of course as we've learned the compass can be wrong compass definitely can be wrong palmyra airport can't see that but basically there's a lot of temples down here i would say it's all of this one thing i will say is how badly did they destroy this i mean how badly can you destroy it i mean i guess you could blow it up with sticks of dynamite and bombs and really destroy it couldn't you i guess but you'd need a lot of heavy i mean is this post ex you know post destruction or pre i don't know maybe they did a bit of a [ __ ] job of it who knows but i am i've got to go for this now i've got to go for it is it anything else here i can use at all it does look like we're in a temple of sorts i'll go i'll go there no i'm going to go back where i was oh my god we're nowhere near we are nowhere near okay so what's probably happened is palmyra did get destroyed and there are probably no photo spheres remaining of it or if there are i'd like to see them no we are in algeria again so we finally get to see what that city was called in my last video iran there it is iran i thought it i was convinced it was in spain but we are in the same country and we are in a place called tim gad tim gad not steve gad no tim gad and there it is it's a roman amphitheater so it's not babylonian i don't know what palmyra actually is but it's a roman one and it kind of did look quite roman but i never would have found that not in a million years well done if you got that who the hell got that let me know honestly in the comments and why the hell you knew that i wanna i wanna be convinced by you that you knew that so that's gonna take some doing if you're lying right next one this looks like it might be portugal no it could no it probably we'll figure it out it's either portugal or brazil but what have we got here sal rai rabil they do sound more portuguese to me and i'd say that the the signs are european as well but i hope i'm right about that god this is interesting maybe okay yeah she's she looks like a tourist possibly a british tourist very pink skinned compared to this woman for example zhao gallego buffarera okay where's the sun because we could be on an island somewhere that's what i'm thinking at the moment sun isn't really making itself known black guy as well and another pretty dark-skinned guy would point more to brazil i i don't know and then the registration plates ah tui tui they are two evans so i would say this is portugal but kind of quite remote because it's a tui kind of safari not safari but you know excursion and there's another one there as well so this i'm thinking this could be a touristy kind of village a bit inland in the algarve right so i'm going to search near the sea in southern portugal then i will go from there okay wish me luck [Music] okay that's interesting i think i think i've ruled out portugal because this is just obviously so hot here yeah that will do me for now so i'm going over to which i'm not completely hopeful about but i'm going over to these um and i'll try this out again i'll speed it up because i'm conscious of the time that this all could take so speeding this up i am in funchal right no funchal is here here we go [Music] hmm yeah it's not looking good not least because it's very flat very very flat the more i look at this the more it looks like brazil but i just don't know at the moment um but yeah that's a very mountainous island is madeira not funchal that's the capital uh so i'm heading over to these now which i think at least in part are also owned by portugal yeah sao miguel right so i'll have a little search here bear with me [Music] okay that is all of the azures done even these ones out here uh so so we've got to be in brazil that's my thought process i don't where am i gonna search here man where am i gonna search god damn okay it still feels like we're on an island somehow okay i'm gonna just skim the coast of brazil quite loosely and see if i find anything that i think i've seen because there's a lot on these signs there's a lot [Music] okay i can go back to that i think there's an island i think there is an island off the coast somewhere please be an island how about this one no can't be here can it cabo verde i guess it could be i'm starting to think it could be [Music] okay we're not on that island there are other ones there's quite a few i'm gonna go on the top one first i've got something gat ass there it's promising but it ain't it's good but it's not quite right at the moment [Music] [Applause] oh oh have we got it i'm sure i saw that sal rai sal rai come on this has to be a rabil come on yes i knew i was onto something here this is why it looked in my defense across between portugal and brazil right but what was really playing on my mind was these vehicles you know the black registrations and the fact that they're there's just a convoy of like four by fours told me that we weren't we're somewhere weird but somewhere that you might go on holiday nonetheless anyway let's try and find it now finally he's too wet we should be able to do this i just need some of my geo guessing ability to come back a bit found this cabeco dos tarafes jiao gallego i found that finally so zhao gallego is that way oh my god man either things aren't very well mapped on here or i've got monumentally confused i think part of the reason i'm getting confused is the compass is probably wrong to be fair thunder i think we might be here you know all in all i just think the i think the compass is wrong but we probably are here i think we're about there yes oh my god that was so confusing so obviously i would have sped that up a bit for you because that took me ages to figure out uh firstly to figure out that we're in cabo verde um but then secondly actually where the hell we were on that particular island in cabo verde because the compass i don't think was right but i can't even be asked to figure out whether it actually wasn't i'm just gonna carry on well done if you also got that oh my god okay what's this guy doing i thought he was trying to shoot us then but i think he's just holding a phone i think he's skyping um face timing whatever people say oh my god i did not expect an islamic hang on a minute we are in pakistan allama iqbal faculty of arts kabul university wait a minute um so we're not in pakistan we're in kabul but i'm still confused as to why it's snowing what do i know um yeah there's an afghanistan flag right let's get to work with this let's try and make this a bit quicker this particular round kabul to be fair is quite yeah i mean you're not a million miles from well the himalayas quite frankly it's probably quite high above sea level and near places like tajikistan which is very mountainous so kabul you hear it a lot in the news and you presume it's hot and maybe it is in the summer but sure as that ain't hot at the moment so let's see if we can find this very distinctive looking building there this is a good one so we're looking for a university and in particular a llama iqbal faculty of arts kabul university okay search for a minute and then i'll speed it up if i haven't found it so i'm looking for yeah some of these official looking places um [Music] universities what do they look like on the map yes we've got a few here kardan university salam university are we recording we are embassy of pakistan let's also look at the layout of the road here it's running north to south there's one running north to south zowell but it ain't that we don't think okay i'm gonna keep searching in this manner and i'll speed it up for you [Music] okay right i found kabul university so i think we're probably around here somewhere um seeing as i've found nothing else anywhere else faculty of arts so we've got science journalism physics so it's only a matter of time i mean that that looks a lot like it look at that faculty of arts but look at the building social science are you sure i think that could be it you know the road it's going directly north but slightly northwest which is also true of that for me that's the building so i'm going for it 18 yards come on get in excellent stuff yep pretty obvious um thought process the whole way through there just a matter of finding it and finding that distinctive building shape i said that at the start um well done if you got that let's move on to the penultimate round right okay now straight away iran wow iran i'm not sure i've ever had iran before this is a complete first afghanistan i don't know if i had that before either if i'm perfectly honest but anyway we're in iran this might be pretty tricky but presumably we are in the capital tiran right maybe not maybe not it's a pretty developed country this could be somewhere else for all i know i can't quite read that street name all i've got is mama mercy as a shop name that is all i've got and that bosh it's a boss shot there's a drill up there okay so bosh mama mercy mercy mama and that which alludes to some scales so it could be a that could be a prison look at the fence or it could be a court of law yeah look so we've got some stuff but yeah i don't know let's go to iran here what what cities do we like we could easily be in shiraz isfahan mashhad but i'm going into tehran i'll go into tehran and because look i'm not going to find this realistically and i haven't got time to search for hours and hours if i search for that hours and hours i could find it but i just haven't got the time unfortunately and i just don't see me finding this unless i just happen to chance upon i mean the roads are adding up but unless i chance upon a law court or a boss shop in the next few seconds really i wonder if that thing there alludes to tehran do you know what i think it does i'm talking about this let's get them lined up not quite but if we go to another city uh isfahan has got the same at the start for some reason i guess it's oh i guess that's the an because it's backwards isn't it i think um i wonder if we can get it from that gorgon look it's making sense are there any other ands that one no it's not making any more sense than the original one tehran so yeah i'm gonna stick to that you never know i'm gonna give myself a couple of minutes here to yeah to just see if i can stumble across this prison [Music] okay i'm gonna go here because there's something there i don't know what it is and i can't find anything better um it's a very big city so yeah i can't find anything better and that's about as much time as i'm willing to spend as i search even more yeah no well done if you got this guys but i couldn't i couldn't go on much longer here we go here's my guess we might not even be in tehran we were in tehran and we were up here oh my god well that's not the direction i thought the road was going at all there's a government office there there's a tool store i'll give you that tool store mercy mama damn so yeah that probably is correct just weren't sure about the the road layout there i don't know anyway that's where we were we only dropped 10 points so that's pretty good uh and i'm glad we were in to ran i hope let me know was i was was that a coincidence that i arrived at that conclusion with that registration plate the license plate or was that kind of correct i mean it was obviously a big city so that helped but anyway um yeah again well done if you got a perfect score there um i think you needed a bit of luck but last round jesus that's mental what is that looks like an old gold mining or some sort of old frontier contraption reminds me of the roller coaster klondike at drayton manor park which no longer exists uh but it was very rickety anyway where are we are we in canada no i was going to say alaska canada because of the frontier but as i've moved around i don't think that is the case at all gee whiz um bryce genovia bryce mate bryce bryce where's the sun sun is just oh look at that bryce genevoir photographer bryce jennifer so as i looked at this as i looked around and absorbed it all i was thinking maybe namibia i don't know why i arrived at namibia but i i don't know i don't know there's no point me rambling on about it but and namibia popped into my mind now is bryce genevoir the kind of name that you would get in namibia or south africa we've got a black dude and two white dudes so yeah i just think it's quite warm here what is that is that almost like a human figure there but i think that's a coincidence so bryce genevoir an old god i guess it could be australia south africa i think this is going to have to be a wild guess though ultimately that looks quite old though that building this looks really old this is an absolute stumper but that this is what this map is is for this is what it's all about i wonder could we be somewhere like this you know i might just go for it desert explorer's adventure center you know um he's the compass right if he's worth his weight insult trusted street view photographer then you would think the compass is correct so let's bear that in mind you know what i'm gonna go with my hunch because i've got [ __ ] all else and i'm gonna go namibia and i'll go there goodness wait a minute okay at least i got the right continent um that would you believe is bloody caboverd the same country we had earlier but looking well not looking very similar at all there it is so it's an ancient hangar this is it old industry old industry but that's amazing we were literally one island up we could have got a we probably could have got a ferry from this island to that island in the time that i made this video no probably not but it did take me a long time um right we've lost a lot of points on that last round as we did on the first round that seems like light years ago but on the other three we didn't do too bad we got a perfect score in kabul and cabo verde round one and we got fairly close into ram uh leaving us with a grand total of 16 138 not the best score but i don't know that might be okay for for a game of that difficulty and that was difficult what i'm going to do is i'm going to see yeah no i know for a fact i need to get a perfect score on this map so that's what i will try and do very soon guys thanks for watching and bearing with me today well done if you beat me as usual i like reading how you correctly identified some of those rounds because i could learn from you so let me know if you got that last round or the first round yeah so yeah perfect score on this map yeah i'm going to give that a good go because i think it's a bit harder than the capital cities one a lot harder anyway until then guys thanks for watching so much again and take care and i'll see you all soon ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 35.4841771, "lng": 6.468907799999999}, {"round": 2, "lat": 16.1392941, "lng": -22.7243641},

how we doing everyone hope we're all doing well i'm very good looking forward to christmas and looking forward to releasing the latest mission across wales last time we did weather spoons so this time we're heading back to the good stuff we're heading back to the juicy stuff interesting photo spheres in obscure countries yet to get a perfect score on this as you can see 19785 is the best i've done so far but i've only played it twice this is good though because it means i've got a real challenge i love a good challenge let's do this if you are new around here um and you want to play along i recommend you do it's really fun follow the instructions in the description uh oh we're going i've clicked start here we go yes first one there's no way i'm going to get a perfect score today this this is a really hard map it's really tough okay here we go i'm gonna need luck i'm gonna need favorable rounds right what have we got here looks like we might be in africa judging by these dudes who look pretty damn african this guy has got i think that's a horrible psg shirt aren't there that almost looks like an african badge there but i think it's just light coming through the van yeah ignore that um yeah just scanning these guys for any clues that they might have this guy's got an interesting hat on a muslim hat i would say right but then over here we have tourists and i think they're chinese tourists not judging by how they look but rather the name down here of the person who took the photo looks pretty chinese to me right oh god and as usual we've got some writing that is just tantalizingly illegible i can't tell what what what language it is all i want to know is what language it is at the very least um right some of the rocks we've got on the floor here look like they might be quite volcanic we've got a [ __ ] the remnants of a fire probably not too sensible got a woman here chinese or japanese taking a selfie i mean yeah it doesn't take a genius to work out that this is a volcano caldera the sun we can't really use and that's it guys that is about it apart from this okay so this let's see where the c is this is semi useful to see i'm still getting used to this compass ah yes lots of you commented didn't you classic compass on resume game yes come on get in right that's north that is north interesting i wouldn't have said north let's get in and and see if we can have a look would it be madagascar perhaps i don't know it could be any of these things couldn't it comoros what we're looking for is a pretty defined a crater a volcanic crater near a coast so yeah i guess we just scan a few coastlines until we find one this is extremely unlikely that i find this guys um wait a minute look at that that can't be it can it just as i said extremely unlikely that i find this and let me just explain why it's extremely unlikely well we could be anywhere in africa however north coast these guys it's it's the muslim looking hat and i think these are these guys also look more eastern african i don't know that's just what i'm vibing but it's this northern shoreline i'll come back to this obviously it can't be that many places you know i guess it could be there for example the north coast of that island but on the whole it can't be any of the northern coast of africa because it's too deserty can't be the south of africa because of the compass same for these bits here that's what i'm trying to say um it could only be these sorts of places around here reunion mauritius anyway i've explained myself uh to the people who will accuse and we're back here and i think this is matching up pretty well i won't lie we've got you can clearly see there's beaches down there uh and you can see the coast goes around there the road does it bend probably and we've got this container there should be a building the other side of the road which i can't see so i'm only i'm only 50 50 or less gonna have a quick look again and speed it up just to see if i find anything better yeah i've checked all the places that i i conceivably think that this could be guys so i am going to go in this place that i found so very early on this would be incredible if this is right it's right 78 yards that's incredible i'm so happy with that one i can't believe i found that so quickly but there it is the comoros who got that let me know uh if you got that i'm guessing it was a similar kind of thought process if you did moving on perfect score is still on um i won't lie i thought it was over in the early stages of that round i thought there's no way i'm going to get this how am i going to get this anyway moving on we are now in somewhere like the pharaoh islands or svalbard yeah faroe islands i'm thinking but it's it's been a while greenland is is another possibility it's been a while ah yeah there we go there's the greenland flag great um uh so we'll get this one this this shouldn't be too hard inu cluby nap i'm guessing nappy fiat is the place just gonna see if the audio levels are correct no just kidding um yeah napafia is gonna be the place i'd love to go to greenland looks so cool let's get in there let's have a look at the compass the sea could be i would have thought it's probably in that direction rather than that one no no it i guess it's more likely to be in that direction okay nappy fiat yeah i am hoping that it i'm right in saying that napi fiat is where we are because if it's not this is going to be a little bit harder and take it a little bit longer time oh dear right okay i'm so sorry if i've uh scrolled over it inus i'm hoping that that's where we are now right i'm gonna have a little search for innus toot wish me luck no dang right we're going to have to scour the map and and find somewhere that that links up with this um so lining this up then i'm looking for a fjord that's that kind of yeah that correlates with this basically with a peninsula in the middle over there right here we go wish me luck this is probably the best thing i've found but it doesn't really make sense i've searched far and wide i've done a lot of searching um yeah i i don't think that's right but i've done enough searching now so uh i am going to make a guess this is wrong yeah right what the hell is going on here then i don't believe it wow that is this coast here is so much further away damn you we were in quaker tatsuwack if that's remotely close see i sir i literally searched this place and decided that it didn't add up that's definitely one area that i'm not great at sometimes is when there's like a bay and i mean it can be confusing the shape of the coastline and the distance and the compass all of those three factors and that's an example where i've i've ruled something out and it's actually correct baffling um anyway we move on it's not going to be a perfect score today but maybe you can beat me today right here we go here's our third round and that is wow that is wow that's really cool i would go out on a limb and say this is like a sort of arabic or muslim country such as i don't know palestine yemen um morocco maybe don't know i've never seen anything like this that's ah there's a there is a flag there is a flag but it's pretty damn hard to make it out i won't lie um blue red and green definitely with possibly i'm really speculating but possibly a white crescent and star but that might just be me cooking that up in my head because i think it's a muslim country right let's see where the sun is let's well let's fully look around first nicholas zelizek is the bloke who took it yeah fertile sort of land down there pretty fertile ah okay i think i might have got it fertile land that looks too north to be yemen for example certainly is that flag azerbaijan i think it might be i know the azerbaijan flag but i was i'd ruled it out i just thought we are too far south for that uh so azerbaijan is over here yeah more arid probably more dry and barren than the mediterranean because it's over towards these deserty reaches anyway got a lot of work to do got to find this place oh christ maybe we're down there maybe we're up here i want to say further down here actually and i've just seen this mountain range it yeah more close to iran would make sense for me so but where the okay right we've got a lake we've got a city is that a city i think so and we've got right okay this is this is adding up now this is starting to starting to get somewhere i think big body of water over there that's north yeah that doesn't make sense unless the compass is wrong which it easily could be so if that was north well where's the sun christ no the sun is in yeah that that looks like it's right that way around with the compass judging by the sun oh this is a roller coaster okay there's that that's a big lake which we have in the distance big reservoir but would we be able to see that i guess so from over here we're obviously looking for some sort of ancient monument as well monument uh yeah whatever you would call it castle couldn't gut could we be there remember we're looking out closer to this ah i was going to say the closer to this the more realistic it is we've also got that remember which could be either of those two things that one or that one oh i just don't know that just isn't particularly adding up to me the lake is too near it seems but again perspectives can be wrong in my case oh man okay uh i'm already off the perfect score remember so it's not quite as desperate if you know i mean i'm just starting to doubt this whole area now to be honest i'm going to go for it i'm just going to click on this i don't think it can be right but uh let's try it where's that what country is that guys first of all let's have a look here that's where we were there's the town to our east there's the rest of it there's the little lake and i believe we were looking at that the aras dam lake and it is azerbaijan i'm a bit confused as to how the borders are working there guys a sealed off enclave or is that because armenia took that over recently i did know i did notice in the news that um armenia were attacking azerbaijan's land i don't know who started it so don't call me out on that so maybe i don't think the maps would have would have recognized that if it was uh untoward but yeah i never would have thought to look in that little enclave in a million years i didn't even know that existed let me know in the comments if that's a new change on the map or not but wow yeah that's a tough one uh also let me know if you got that right because that's very impressive let's do the last but one round now taco parrier main road to mata lot or mate lot mate a lot i mate a lot don't i mate galara road salibia lighthouse kilometers lots of signage over here taco village olympics harvest well it's in english um rankin production took the imagery the sun is right up in the sky well would you look at that uh over here we've got a um it's a beer but can't read it that that just looks like a great sign but we can't read it because the imagery is very grainy here these guys right okay i'm starting to think now these kind of look like islanders by islanders i mean jonah from tonga you know that sort of thing um yeah so maybe yeah maybe something like tonga or samoa and we're driving on the left so i think that would back that up i presume um yeah so and that's about all we've got but we do know that taco is the name of the village that we're in let's just see if there's anything that gives away you know what what country is what island it is um something parts after lane oh i don't think yeah i don't think we're gonna get it and this could be quite tricky it's definitely gonna be quite tricky unless i happen to chance upon it like i did in the first round so we're looking at these sorts of place this is just uh caught my eye takalao oh wow that is literally just nothing isn't it skeleton of an island um right so taco parrier main road these are probably what we need to look at actually salibia lighthouse matalot i think we want to be looking for mata loss i'm going to call it mate lot uh mate a lot so i've just realized mate a lot sounds like shag a lot doesn't it i didn't mean didn't mean that earlier um sadly that's not true i meant i say mate a lot don't i mate mate mate um right yes i'm looking for mate a lot which is now i can't call it anything else what's that damn letters in the wrong order uh yeah okay i'm gonna keep looking american samoa and very soon if i don't have much luck as usual i will speed things up for you but i'm searching [Music] the islands the pacific islands uh yeah i can't find this place for love nor money i really can't i'm convinced it's somewhere near australia i don't know why the people are driving on the left the signs to the names but uh i've honestly i think i've searched everywhere yeah i give up regrettably she's going to try something else before i entirely give up um and search over in the caribbean because there are similarities uh mainly the english you know the the the british influence if you like no the names are too british i think might as well be in britain really with some of these names cooper's town blackwood village marsh harbour um yeah i don't know where to go from here cayman islands last one port of spain trinidad come on taco i don't believe it that's crazy man that is the last place i was going to look in fact i started zooming out and then i thought oh i don't think i've searched there why not that's amazing and it makes sense because i think it's a x british but it's very close to venezuela so it's got that spanish blend and as i zoomed in i thought yeah maybe that there's something there and there it is taco i saw it and mate a lot is down there oh my goodness me wow i was just about to go back to american samoa which would have been the worst score imaginable right where are we are we there let's find out taco [Music] can i get this right i think we could be there yeah i'd like to get a perfect score now if we can taco main road oh 3.5 3.5 right that makes sense yeah that makes sense i'm doing it nine yards come on oh i'm so glad i got that one because it was getting a bit desperate i didn't want to just guess somewhere random but that's what i was looking at until trinidad and tobago came to our rescue thank you trinidad and tobago don't forget tobago last one uh this is to get us over 20 000 and maybe even beat my best score i can't remember if i can do that right i've just looked at the name um i didn't mean to but i did it's done gla glo gloya me jesus what a hard name to say what are you playing at gloria mahigissi okay we've got a shadow and the sun is kind of in the north which puts us maybe in the south southern hemisphere right yeah so god this could this could be an obscure country well it it is going to be um but it could be hard to work it out is what i'm trying to say right what language do we have that doesn't seem like english ojay is not really a combo of letters that's usually seen in the english language this guy i thought he was swearing at someone and his mates trying to discourage him don't swear to him don't don't don't you you'll aggravate him anyway christian country we're in africa aren't we we are in africa archveche archeveche right and that's pretty much it are there any flags i've got to just completely search for flags would the maker of this map include eswatini or lesotho well i doubt it's those anyway because it would yeah there's there's google street view in those countries so i think we're looking at potentially zimbabwe mozambique maybe we're a bit further north than that zambia angola tanzania that would be difficult but we're either high up altitude wise or we're quite far south because the the trees aren't super super tropical but they're getting there um and we also have the colorful it's very it's yeah it's a christian african country uh which doesn't really really help me a lot um archae vacher veche is that a town i don't see how i'm going i don't see where i go with this archer vetcher namibia botswana i just it doesn't look like botswana we know that i'm looking for countries that have places with e on the end this kind of does kalu kwembe namibe okay oh dear mozambique let's have a little look at this ah okay and gotcha and gotcha i like that i like that i like the che at the end that's the best thing we've found yet and it is sure as hell an obscure country i am of course just trying to find archer veche even though it might not be a place because what else can i do as a result of that i think it's kind of that's it for me really um podja pot oja oja but again like that might not be the town probably isn't no i'm gonna go back to mozambique guys and reluctantly put a marker down um somewhere it's fairly a big city where it's fairly mountainous how's tete okay now i feel christmassy um right uh mountainous place liching how about that let's go there this is a wild guess this is definitely not right but can you imagine if i got the right i'll be very very pleased with the right country here we go ah right not a million miles away 865 miles away let's see here okay oh that is the democratic republic of congo didn't mention that at all and we're in a city called bukhavu we're not far from a huge lake like kivu which i didn't see any water at all there um but there it is the arche veche so arche veche probably means church in some language could be french i don't know i can't i haven't got the brain power to come contemplate that at the moment we were a few countries away one two technically speaking um have we crested twenty thousand no sadly not um and that's because that was a really tough game again um i got a couple of perfect scores i think literally two um yeah two that first one was one to really remember uh as was trinidad and tobago let me know if you got that one by the way i forgot to uh mention that but the rest sadly were lacking a bit they were tricky they were confusing some of them didn't have many clues and when they did they took a real lot of effort um to to possibly get them right and i guess maybe if i wasn't so hard at work editing all day maybe if i had more free time i would have really really persevered a bit more today it wasn't meant to be i don't i don't know if i could ever have got a perfect score on that not without spending the whole day on it probably um but nonetheless i really enjoyed that i hope you did too and the next video guys is going to be the first episode in one hell of a straight line mission i'll see you there have a great weekend and i'll see you on the other side thanks again for watching

is how thick i like my plectrums 0.8 millimeters 0.88 millimeters so now you know welcome back to the channel everyone uh first of all apologies that it's been almost two weeks since a video i i did try and get one out last week but things piled up and long story short i couldn't get it out in time um very soon i will be embarking on my crazy challenge uh which will involve me attempting to dribble a football across britain that is next week um and this is why the the videos have been far and few between and and not very high production if you like uh it's another geo guesser video today and we're going to be checking out this map again for the fourth time because um it's been really popular it's been really fun to play interesting photo spheres in obscure countries over a thousand locations uh very popular and just lots of opportunities for some great detective work which is what we love you guys can play along do follow the instructions in the description i'll say no move they're photospheres so it's fine um some of you are probably wondering you know how the preparation is going for this dribbling britain as i seem to have named it uh pretty damn good i'm training a lot i'm going on regular uh long hikes um and that's one of the reasons why um i'm so busy but i won't give any more away for now let's play some geo guesser okay that is interesting villa leli dorp and this language here in heartier lidor in apartheid tests something in heart yeah lidor so that sounds dutch to me but it could be afrikaans but we're not in south africa look it's too tropical down here we have a family couldn't begin to tell you what sort of ethnicity they are so i'm thinking before i turn around anymore that we might be in some sort of you know dutch overseas territory that's what i'm thinking so far uh and the tropicalness would back that up we've got a fire engine down here with some dudes um s r k b s dot s r does that say or s seven it looks like but it can't be that most people seem quite dark skinned but maybe a mixture of of shades uh yellow number plate down there yeah we we're by a fire station that much is clear oh we've got a flag what is that that is a fl that's a really cool looking flag oh is that a star in the middle so is it surinam maybe that has that flag i'm not like a hundred hundred percent on all the flags we've got yellow number plates this is one thing's for sure as i check to see if we are recording and we are um one thing is for sure i've never had this country before these bright yellow number plates the dutch writing different colored roofs um [Music] some of these cars actually have seen better days are they just there as like a kind for a laugh they just were they actually being stored there i don't know or were they burnt out very recently and no one's had a chance to move them i don't know people seem quite happy here this seems quite quite a nice place to live the at least these seem happy maybe they're the criminals maybe they're the ones burning the you cars never judge a book that's the thing and we've got a fire station right here so if you were going to burn a car for a laugh for a bit of a thrill that would be a sensible place to do it just light it by the fire station run off no one's probably going to get hurt they're probably going to extinguish that pretty soon although having said all that i don't even know if they've actually been on fire they haven't been completely burnt out fire service doing a good job tom yeah shut the [ __ ] up okay um let's have a look at suriname because i might be wrong about suriname even being a dutch thing i might be totally oh my god lilly dorp i've seen it straight away so i was right dutch yeah dutch-owned suriname and you can see some of the let the names here deyong south stalkers cyber very interesting right we're in lelidorp and we're hoping that we can find well what we got what we got over here can we can we read any of it can't really read any any actual businesses so i'm going for the fire station would that be it no that's a hospital what would a fire station look like on the map wait where's the com i always there we go i've got the compass going it's when i delete all my search history and then i have to sign back into geography and it forgets that i like it forgets that i'm stuck in my ways and that i like the old compass right so that's changed things around a bit so let's have another look at the map [Music] right i haven't found this fire station so what do we do there's the compass we've got this main road it's kind of coming could be that one or more likely this one i want to get a perfect score see i don't know if i've had a perfect score on this in fact let's before we go any further let's find out the the highest score that i've ever got i'm going to go there um temporarily howdy [ __ ] you 19785 yeah 19785 then is what we're aiming for i am going to write that down that is our target and that's a good target to be we're kind of in the at the mercy of the geo guessing god so of course but you know it it depends what rounds we get we could be screwed over big time um but we'll try our best and this is definitely a round we can get points on so am i gonna try and get and find this fire station i think i'm going to trust the angles a bit that's north so i'm going to trust the angles and i'm going to say that we are there it's probably wrong but we can't be too far away can we that's where we were apparently uh we've lost three points so look um it perfect score ain't really going to happen let's see if i could actually have got that anyway there's no nothing actually really adds up too much there the compass was probably wrong where's the road that was here that just i believe is wrong i'm not saying i was right but i i don't know what happened there maybe one of you can work that out let's move on though let me know if you did get a perfect score and this looks incredible and it it's another one of those ancient roman or yeah i would say i'm no historian but it's gonna be one of those roman or ancient greek uh or an ancient civilization built this i'm gonna i'm gonna stick my neck out and say and this is gonna be nion impossible isn't it we know that um well we don't know a lot here we're obviously going to be in the northern hemisphere there's only a few countries this could be um you know around the realm of the roman empire or the middle east the babylonian kind of regions but even better than that we've got an arabic name that has taken this muad bu mood muadbu mood and it's it's not just arabic it's and again i'm not an expert at this kind of thing but that sounds to me to be kind of iranian iraqi kind of name might be wrong you know and even the fact that it's taken by an arabic named person doesn't categorically mean we're you know we could be in sicily it might be a tourist but it's just odds we're working with odds here that's what you've got to work with so uh i might be i might be wrong about that iraq thing i think i'm going off mahmoud muad bhumud i think i'm going off like president's names here mahmoud abbad what was his name the iranian president i ain't gonna say that anyway this is incredible by the way like can you imagine what this was like as a city i mean absolutely amazing for this still to be here in some way i'm not going to get this there is no there's not much point in researching this could be in turkey it could be in syria it's quite green isn't it and we've got mountains in the distance big mountains over there but it is quite green i don't think and look at the grass as well you know we've got like little weeds and thistles and stuff i don't think we would be last time we were in tunisia weren't we which is always an option oh we've got we've got an o u n which we haven't got in the name but i know you is good so we could we could be in tunisia very easily and this could be like a roman structure so what i'm gonna do guys is i'm gonna have a little bit of a look on the map and this will be hugely sped up um right now i'm searching in tunisia just to see if any roman sites jump out of me on the map then i'll line it up to any surrounding mountains and the shape of the if if we if we zoom in on the correct roman site i'll probably get it that's the good news and that's why i'm searching wish me luck the last one was actually in this country wasn't it algeria which the romans also you know all the coast they had so i will i will look in the northern reaches of algeria actually and just see if i can find any big ones hey i like this guys um in one screenshot there's two bou's bou boumoued so this sounds algerian these names so that makes me feel a bit better about this i'll keep searching just after i've stopped sneezing oh it's huge algeria is so big and you've got to zoom in so far to find these things i'll i'm finding one roman as soon as i find one that says roman i'm done i think i'm done i think i'm done i haven't seen anything better than this seems to be a lot around here lollius urbicus sounds pretty damn roman quintus lollius urbicus um let's just go for it i'm dreading a terrible score here there you go that's not terrible that is not terrible we were directly south of there and we were here oh tim gad roman ruins i wonder if that's where we were before it definitely wasn't the same photo sphere but it could have been a different part of tim gad don't think it was no i think it was you know i think we had a different photo sphere in that same place because i remember saying tim gad as opposed to steve gad wow points wise this is okay we knew you know we know we're not gonna get a perfect score here so it's just about keeping those points up that was a bit lucky in the sense that i'd had an algerian roman round before but so would you well those of you who watch that video next one right now this is a far-flung place from the roman empire we've got asian letters i can't be asked to think of a better phrase than that i don't care anymore sunregis some regis so kind of western words there some regis it's english isn't it could be could be a few languages could be latin again some regis so that's a hotel right so this is the sunregis hotel maybe um can't read where we are it was taken by ben look ben look without the c uh let's hope he brings us some luck here got blue number plates is that is this hong kong we got blue blue and black another place i just can't remember a lot of this stuff got mountains in the background um i'm i think i'm fairly happy with hong kong at the moment can't be taiwan because the number plates can't be china i don't think they'd have sent regis in china i guess in shanghai or something like that they could mountains in the background yeah i think i i can't read anything else so i'm going to make this one a fairly snappy one guys partly because i don't want to have to change my mind halfway through i'm just going to go it can't be japan it can't be south korea because we don't have the it's not the right script so i'm going hong kong it could be macau but if it's macau that's all right it's only over the way so i'll go hong kong and i'm gonna painstakingly look for this hotel no not really i'm not gonna do that saint regis i could have a quick look i mean you know well we're not going to be there i'm not going to be there i'm going to go here without looking anymore [ __ ] it [ __ ] it right off look at that we are in china what wow this is quite fascinating so this lassa is that like the capital of tibet so to speak i think it might be it looks like it's the biggest city potentially in tibet but there we go are we really there really doesn't look like there's some regis hotel there was it even a hotel i don't know wait a minute we're not playing that absolutely awful map are we can't see a regis hotel it's a bit annoying that is a little bit annoying well that was frustrating on both sides of the uh of the reveal and it's a frustrating point so one two four five we've dropped big points there can we beat 19 785 i don't know that we we can but these two need to be so good so this is the goal now these last two rounds need to be almost perfect come on again we're still in the lap of the gods but i'm willing to work i'm willing to work to try and beat the record because that was poor that last round we didn't have much to go on salic photography and we've got a flag but it's one of those flags that could be a few flags i i'm thinking jordan at this point but we'll keep looking is that a flag there that huge that actually looks more like afghanistan if that's a flag let's keep looking round because we've already got two flags we might have more um it does look pretty poor [Music] i don't know and afghanistan as well uh here we go select photography come on give us a domain that is an afghanistan flag black red green where was i seeing white on that one i think that's the sky there that bit there it's the same color as this so we're in afghanistan afghanistan can be deceivingly kind of northern looking and if you look on the map that's because it is it does it is it borders tajikistan and uzbekistan even are we in kabul well we've got mountains over there so i'm going to look on the map select photography we've got mountains to the south as well so we know we're in afghanistan we know we're probably not down here in the deserty bits helmand province in kabul we do have mountains to the east and we do have mines to the south so that could correlate does correlate it there's quite a lot of different ranges in and around kabul are they big mines with snow on in the distance or am i just am i seeing things there i'm not sure they look like big mountains to the north east that could be those couldn't it they look bigger so actually i i would if anything i'd be looking in this area because we've got mountains to the south but not that big and then we've got big ones over there doesn't mean we're necessarily here but the road would correlate it is going at that kind of it is going at that direction that's good i mean imagine if we found imagine if we got this guys imagine sally photography i'm gonna have a little look because you never know you just never know please be on the map you've gone you've really gone to town with the shop front photography questionable but you've gone to town with the sign could do with an update actually but you've made an effort at some point a few years ago so please just put it on the internet put it on google so if if we are here i don't think his shop is on here just to get things into perspective it's so likely not to be it's it's it might not be kabul kabul is it's only 50 50 that it's kabul even we could be there you know i don't know we'll see i think it's fairly likely to be kabul but we'll see how close i get here goes oh [ __ ] me okay oh we've lost i i don't even know if we're still in it here we were 51 miles away good job i went to the eastern ends of kabul that's where we apparently were the road was even more of an extreme angle he's not on google so i was right about that yes get in but it's a hollow victory the mountains to the south were quite far and the mountains to the northeast were very big indeed you can see how tall they look i mean that is proper osama bin laden territory that is yeah so moment of truth here a double whammy what's the next round okay that looks promising but we cut wait can we do it yeah of course we can do it i don't know why i keep thinking we've lost loads of points more points than we have so if we get a perfect score here of course and basically we need four thousand we need four we need four thousand one hundred something like that i won't work it out exactly right this says it qui buca 25 and um of course i'm wondering how many of you are beating me here and will beat me as always let me know in the comments at the end there's the flag so we have a flag i mean this is what we need but whether that's a country or an overseas territory of another country i'm not sure it could be either because as i said earlier i'm not 100 on all those little tiny nations i'm struggling to think what that that is we've got yellow number plates but they're kind of like european shaped but definitely not european we're in a tropical sort of place those cars are is that a toyota corolla and that might even be a toyota mr2 or some or mazda maybe so potentially um asian cars we've got a fairly big city up there that's interesting pretty big city and so this cui buca qui buca it sounds to me like a sort of australasian oceanic name like out here somewhere could would be on vanuatu something like that whatever it is it's gotta be it's gonna have a fairly big capital to it as you can see up there i mean those are some pretty big buildings the main question i've got is is qui buca the name of this city if it is then great we'll find it fairly quickly i would have thought but i don't think it is because i think i would have heard of it if it's this big and built up this is just my first hunch i'm looking at places like this you know um places that i don't know much about qui buca so i can look at languages so this sounds this looks french vanuatu is a rue cornwall rue edinburgh i think there's been some real serious mixing trading of uh land there i just don't think i think these islands that i'm looking at are too small what we've got over there is so built up see that could just be the name of the street it could be a really fancy apartment that you stay in what what does the 25 stand for you know number 25 qabuka quibuca road don't know i don't think we're in samoa i don't think it's this built up so where does that leave me um ah now this this is gonna be tough but i'm so determined to get this so we've got the caribbean but qui buca for a start doesn't really remind me of the caribbean where's the sun it's kind of in the south if anything but it's pretty damn westerly we can't really use that um let me have a look through some of these caribbean places lucia barbados some vincent let me have a little look martinique is just all going to be french there's no point dominica looks pretty english as well guadalupe monsieur is small anguir u.s virgin islands right that is one big place willemstad look at that kabuto boss kabuto boss kaya there's definitely like an old language that's still got an influence here seru it's a lot of apartments here mahay i'm liking the language it does seem to fit this might be totally wrong guys we you know i don't know all right let me search this place because it's big it's built up it takes a few boxes it's built up it's obviously the right um tropicalness it's in the southern hemis it's in the northern hemisphere just the flag i can't remember it's obviously owned by the netherlands so that would make sense that i wouldn't know the flag um and also what i thought was to see out here isn't it's kind of hilly so leave it with me let me let me check i'm just looking for qui buca i'm just looking for that word because it's got to be if this if my trailer thought is right it's got to be either a road or an apartment name look at these names though nikki bocco why nappa harry [ __ ] i'm gonna go for it man i'm gonna just really gamble here because while lots of things add up i really could be on the other side of the earth genuinely i don't know the flag for curacao i don't know the the license plates i don't remember guys i don't remember um there's certain things that add up which i've explained the only other thing is are we could we be somewhere in africa but i just don't think there'd be that much wealth up there look at that no way unfortunately for africa i don't think that's right so i'm just gonna go for it i literally just thought about rwanda you are kidding oh god wait a minute that is a really hard one to take for various reasons not only have i offended the whole continent of africa but as i said that i don't know whether i hovered my mouse on rwanda but i thought to myself rwanda is one of those places that's quite built up now and it's had quite a lot of investment but i thought nah it can't be rwanda don't know why just thought we would buy this near the sea or just dismissed it and the other thing that makes it worse we were by kigali genocide memorial honoring the rwandan genocide which in which millions of people were brutally murdered um like that's where we actually were we weren't a swanky apartment in the caribbean oh my god i'm sorry people of rwanda that must have been really annoying for you and we were looking at yeah like the the business district of kigali up on the hill but the the the flag oh my god see i thought oh yeah i see it now the blue bit is bigger i thought it was just equal like the french flag vertical strips but yeah that is bigger it's just all scrunched up it's caught in the clutches of this tree if i'd have seen the star maybe i'd have got it i don't know man that has ended that on a really bum note and a somber note let's view the summary 15716 how many of you got that last round how many of you got rwanda i'm sure some of you did how many of you got china i'm sure some of you did as well apart from the first round which still wasn't perfect who would have thought that would be the closest one goes to show what a difficult map this is and what a good challenge this is going to be going forward to try and get why not try and get a perfect score uh one day but for the time being try and beat this score uh i'm gonna leave it there guys because um i've rambled on quite sufficiently for you um the next video you see i'm unsure because next week i'll be filming the dribbling across britain series um i might make a video to kind of encourage some donations uh for the charities which i'll be raising money for um but yeah it's still going to be a little bit slow over the next couple of the next week or so but all the same i hope you're enjoying these geogra videos i'm having fun doing them and i'll see you for the next one thanks for watching and take care ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 5.70027896660768, "lng": -55.21847985170768}, {"round": 2, "lat": 35.48501307227422,

juice how's it going everyone welcome back to the channel particularly you Geo guesser heads because you're the ones who have been neglected as a group as a marginalized group uh if if anyone has been it's you the adventure fans you you you're fine you've been treated especially next week you will be treated uh when you finally get to see my attempt at dribbling a football across Britain in under 24 hours oh did you not hear about that oh did you not that's next week check it out I'm thinking Wednesday or Thursday but anyway we're here to play geoguessr I've found this map I don't I have definitely haven't played this one before it's called geodetective World from what I can tell better than geodetective the map that I used to play uh it's hand-picked really good juicy detective rounds perfect score is going to be hard it's just going to be a great play-along game so here's the link let's copy that and well I've just realized I'm not ready and that I haven't played in ages it's gonna it's I really need my where's my thinking cap I don't own one I need to get my metaphorical thinking cap on here and just try and try and be patient and let the information that is in there float to the surface and that's what you guys can do too play along it's great fun and we are off like we have been so many times before uh well I I can't help but be drawn in by the Flag straight away so what's that what is that flag it's not Saint Kitts and Nevis oh man I'm so Rusty with flags right now it's getting embarrassing I'll come back to it no I I do know it I do know it I'm just coming back to it there's some Christopher air and seaports authority authority so we speak in English are we no are we recording that and yes we are and the audio is working I knew that I knew that uh so so we you know we're at a port we're at a c Port I think that is some kits and Nevis ah we'll see we'll see these people I mean not to generalize but she looks quite Jamaican uh Caribbean so that's all I'm saying she looks quite Caribbean what what does that say protection something there seems to be a bad a bad air about the place here something something's delayed some boat is pretty damn delayed here look at the impatience of these people uh is that does that continue all around is everyone miffed no these people seem okay maybe they're the ones who have just got off the others are waiting to get on I don't know there we go Saint Kitts and Nevis cargo passenger Ferry services I hadn't seen that I promise I don't even know if that was in view to begin with but I hadn't seen that I know my flags all right believe me um right so that's a cruise a Caribbean cruise oh how I'd love to go on a Caribbean cruise these people could be Brits such as myself or Americans let's have a vote British or American or other Saint Christopher air and Seaport so let's get right into it folks and can I find it I think I can there it is Saint Kitts and Nevis so Trinidad and Tobago is it's amazingly far south isn't it I get confused with some of these right now is there going to be a no there isn't there it is uh Saint Kitts Kristoff oh no no I think I've jumped the gun Christoph Harbor do they have different different names for these so I was going to say is is there going to be set back a a red herring here um and it looks like there already is some Christopher air and seaports see Saint Christopher might be the name of the Island although you would think that the island would either be Nevis or Saint Kitts yeah it is it is ah oh no right let's look at the compass I'm being I'm being slow here I'm showing my rust aren't I right we're in a big like we've got to be here we've got to be very terminal basseter let's see if we can find anything that says basseter see if we can find that I don't think we need to see Hustler Charlestown well that's that doesn't confuse things I think without I think we can see the shape of the port here and that arm there oh yeah it was definitely it's definitely I'm going for it 16 yards probably a bit Hasty there to to just go for it but I think we've got a hundred a hundred odd yard buffer yeah next one that's one round down four to go so far so good um but who knows what could happen I would like one a bit easier than that at least one I don't I don't want to be really really tested today because I am Rusty but I do want a nice dose of detective work that one was easy most of you will have got that I would have thought and if you didn't you're not really you're not really trying an eye you'll be the first to admit that so yeah that's fine University of what of North University of North Zoological carock q-a-r-o-c-h is what I'm reading it's English so you know we can't be in Senegal or somewhere like that which is you know where my mind would go to with uh you know black Muslim folk on geoguessr because usually Senegal is is uh was probably the only place that that would fit that description um but here clearly we're in a different country does that say Chad Chad something probably not I'm probably reading things that aren't there there Dayo foreign Lola is the iron Lola uh why is that so hard for me to say or you uh is the person who photographed it we're not going to get any more clues it's as simple as that and and are we gonna get this I don't know we're gonna have to find this University of North car Rock um I haven't got a freaking clue I'm dying to go into the map though Sudan Chad what about Chad do they speak oh God do they speak English in Chad [ __ ] knows I have not got a clue that's surely the middle of the Sahara up there oh God okay this isn't really so much of a really clever detective Ram with lots of intricacies but this is more of a a real Searcher I think I think I'm gonna have to really search because we have a wide field of possible places that this could be it's Africa it's English speaking I think do you know what oh we we can find this out so yeah look this is what I did now this I was wrong this is where the detective play comes in Le Grand Marsh um this is French isn't it Boutique doom doom round point dembe so Chad is an owner there we go we've eliminated a country I think Sudan let's have a look at Sudan let's get into Khartoum do they speak English or do they speak French it's looking French cartoon fish market Central Market Afra shopping mall Lounge Majestic Olympic Gym twins Cafe that's enough so Sudan is looking like an option but I'm I'm just gonna just gonna check every tray I'm pretty sure they speak English because we had a teacher no wasn't that Italian Alfa Romeo what well that's pretty big evidence Djibouti Somalia what do they speak in Somalia I don't even know you know I think it's English isn't it anyway there's some options I am thinking Sudan I don't know about South Sudan not sure about that but anyway I'm gonna look parok Zoological carock hang on a minute University of I'm starting to think that doesn't say North because it doesn't make sense Zoological Garden Zoological this is the detective work I love this it's not rocket science Zoological Garden University of that cannot say North it has to say something else i l o r i h but if I thought that said karak God knows what that could say ILO actually X we can see the whole of that o so probably not that probably is an ILO I really don't know if we're gonna get this man am I Wrong by saying they're Muslim I don't think so but let me just see what else is down here this is a hard one ah see I was just thinking this could be Nigeria because there are Muslims in Nigeria further north so N 200 like could that mean Nigerian dollar 200 oh I don't know ewe usually in a more obscure country let me search for a little bit this could be this could be a hard one oh Lauren that is definitely an option Lauren oh that's a big coincidence if that's not right let's get in there University of Laureen I think that's that's swayed it that swayed it for me so where's the Zoological Garden this is really depending on how how good and how [ __ ] is this Zoological Gardens because if it's pretty [ __ ] then it could be wedged wedged in somewhere uh in in an urban area if it's really good and big it's got to be a bit further out but I'm I really can't find it anywhere on the map so I'm gonna have to make a guess here University of Lorraine is here so I'm going to have to just yeah just make a guess unfortunately screw it I'll go I'll go there this won't be right but I can't spend all day oh man there is unilar in zoo but Botanical Garden [ __ ] said the lion oh that's really annoying that is really clearly didn't look very hard because I didn't even see that so I don't deserve it I don't deserve the 12 points that I dropped next round EU Para para 2000 EU does that mean EU I I don't know let's look around let's look around oh it's yeah see that's Brazil That's Portuguese station something docan it looks pretty historic I don't know that these things are used anymore maybe they are maybe they're not going to be able to ring read those but this is this is this the sea or is it a big river the further I pan across I'm thinking that could be a big river a big old steam train there yeah I wonder what city this could be if this is the Amazon wouldn't it be cool if this is the Amazon bear with me I just wanna no I just I just want to have a look just wanna have a look manaus can't be that way on the other side uh Santa REM no doubt but big boats could come down here right it's got to be deep it's got to be really deep hasn't it don't know if we can be there though because of all these islands that we've got there um I'm just having a brief look at the moment I'm going with the Amazon Theory bellem macappa no that is kind of isn't anything else that it could be so loot I'm just scanning the map guys that's what I've got to do we can't be there because we'd be looking out to sea um so that I feel like we we could be narrowing things down we can't be there because that's a lake and the boats wouldn't get anywhere so moving Downstream running out of options is there another Big River hmm it seems that there isn't that's interesting let me get back up here hang on a minute the guy who took this by the way is called Ricardo Castel Blanco could we be in Portugal surely not two three this seems to me like an old Industrial sort of dockyard that's been converted into bars and whatnot it's been uh what's the word that's right gentrified wow okay I can't see anything that lines up in Brazil this is a really this is a really interesting one it's uh it's a challenge this is going to be a challenge for sure um I don't see how it could be any other place though we definitely definitely Portuguese it can't be no it can't be it can't be no no can't be cabovad for me it's got to be Brazil so I think we've got to pull our finger out here [Music] see that that kind of looks like it adds up that the compass would be completely wrong here by the way but say if we were there which it doesn't look like we are but let's say we were you look out you see this Gap here which would be that then you see this here which would be that and then that Island there which would be that I guess and then beyond that you see um doesn't really add up I don't know I don't know what else I've got I really don't [Music] that kind of does add up I've got it get in pistachio Das docas and you know what what is the Comfort saying there is that that could be right you know it could be bloody right you stupid idiot uh and funnily enough we're not looking at this clump of uh you know bits of land but very similar looking ones up here the Gap the land the Gap the land and but that yeah that's it we've got it uh just that took me ages that took me I don't know 15 20 minutes if not more uh need to find the correct spot though definitely so uh this is number three that's number two we've got that tall building behind that's hard to say if that's two I would put us more there then there's no restaurants I can read so I'm gonna go for that you know bed you know bed but I got the points but still a knob bed I don't know whether I'm talking to about me or the or or the game uh both probably right number four so so far I've only dropped 12 points so if you're beating me fair play right okay now this I want this to be an easier one now okay Mogadishu guest house two and rest and restaurant so this will be Somalia I hope Mogadishu guest house 2. completely uninventive title but I don't care Mogadishu capital of Somalia come on let's just get the guest house too come on just just pop up for me that would be so good I might even come and visit if you do that maybe don't pop up too quick then in that case um Mogadishu guest house too that's all there is to it can you tell I'm trying to get this one over and done with quicker um surely because that last one Zapped me man it really did so at the moment I'm just searching Mogadishu guest house too I think for a start this looks bizarre can I just say that I mean what crazy tiles and colors and like what's that it's just quite quite different very different okay but nothing's going to give anything away so it's time to speed things up again I wonder how long this will take to find I found the British Embassy that's useful to know where that is for when I do uh make my trip out of here anyway here we go I've got it that is no that's got to be the quickest that had to be 0.3 seconds I'll measure it but between let's speed this up and I've got it that was incredibly short time um here we go though yeah this is it I'm just I'm just I'll go there last round last round here we go are we in can we can we be in Europe please or something I think we might be I think I think we are yeah it's Poland it's Poland which is uh I'm not fluent in Polish I I won't lie adarasia yeah okay which just trying to figure out which word is the town I think we can do this students Sanctuary student you can rule out words you can rule out words um and then hopefully by doing that you can find the town so contact that's someone's name need zela has got to be opening times or something adoracia doesn't sound like a place name that that kind of does but it's the fact that it's with that word kind of makes me think it's not none of these none of these really are screaming uh places uh that I'm not sure oh this is hard this is I tell you what I'll look around a bit it's trying to I'm just getting a feel for how big this place is I think it's a fairly small town with a fairly big church this is this really is detective work isn't it it really is gonna be about these boards isn't it Poland isn't the biggest place as we know but it is it is quite big that's that's the thing that's the problem we have but this is going to be a case and I am determined to end this video with a perfect score just in case any of you were sneaking up on me points wise this is going to be a case of picking this apart just like the ancient Egypt historians deciphered the hieroglyphics that's what it's going to be I just need the actual town to be on here somewhere otherwise I might track down the maker of this map and kill them just kidding but that'll be really annoying uh anyway I've Got a Feeling none of these words are are the place I'm looking on the west side here because just sounds quite German but could that really be a play couldn't that mean Adoration of God more so it's almost Latin they're using a Latin word they're they're months that oh no it's Alexander again that yeah that is the uh the priest I think of the area God by the time I've done this I'll know every goddamn thing about this the Diocese of this particular town um so we're not going to get it from that poster that is good no it's got a w y at the end let me look let me just look briefly this is this is high plus Nar godney something like that isn't it Nar godney almost sounds Czech Republican and that that does sound like a place name doesn't it Nar godney [Music] okay I'm giving up on our godney what else we got right I've discovered a word here this one Trey I really can't read it Tres zeuski or something it's there and it's here as well ski [Music] I mean I can't even see it let alone say it but I think that's yeah look we've I've already found a trz that's not right but couple more of those and I think we'll have our place so he says um here goes I don't think it's quite right but this area you know on our screen here we've got two TR zedders so maybe this is the area I need to be looking in maybe not we are we we are slowly making incremental progress here so yeah you shouldn't be bored has another one man these that's three now TR Z's just tantalizing me really hoping that I don't miss it and again this might has another one there's another one again like I you're probably thinking why are you so sure this is the town name I'm not I'm really not but it's bloody hell one two three four Zeds in that one but it starts with an s I've got a chance here but chances are shrinking by the second this is big man I've never really done something quite like this before my options are running out don't really want to go back over what I've already looked I think I think I'm done I think I've got to pick one of these towns reluctantly Church there and paraffia it's not right do I need to strive for better oh guys I've searched for some words for some amount of time now words that I cannot read nor say and I've had just about enough so here we go I'm gonna go here in this town screw it oh oh do you know what though Sue welki was that even on there there it is look Conca tedra Alexandra Sue alcac that was that was on there opposite side to Germany I don't think I would have got that I'm just trying to convince myself that that was impossible so that I can't feel bad and I've successfully done it um view summary 24009 do you know what I can't be too disheartened with that we were over the 24 000 Mark if you were too well done if you got that last one please tell me how and I presume if you got that last one you got all of them but maybe not do let me know in the comments because when I get time I like to skip through and see how people did um so yeah but right now I'm I feel like a broken man that that was that was a difficult return to the game that I built this channel on I hope you enjoyed it though thanks for watching and um the next video you see now on this channel will be dribbling Britain I'll see

that could be awkward if i do get shot if i do get shot and you're looking back on this going oh that didn't age well don't worry about it i don't care whatever i had a good life um anyway this is a video that i made on a busy day a few days before i left for the states in a bid to try and give you guys a bit of entertainment while i'm away to try and fill that month that gap up a bit and i've picked a video that won't take me too long to make or edit so sorry if it's a pile of but i actually think this is a good idea six years ago i made this this is the 11th video i ever made 30 seconds per round one okay so it's just me playing the regular old map of geo guest so look how different it actually looks um getting places like italy sweden and finland now when i played this i would have oh there i am confusing canada with new jersey um when i played this i would have been quite poor at geo guesser relatively to what i probably am now although i am rusty but i would have had a few goes i would imagine i would have had a few goes probably would have got some awful guesses and this might have been my seventh or eighth go maybe more maybe less to give you guys a decent video to to make it a full one an entertaining one the score that i got was seventeen thousand three hundred and thirty there it is you can see i actually confused usa for canada twice but i did get argentina i got sweden and i don't know what that one is there i think i got italy wrong i cannot tell you how long it's been since i played this the classic experience oh no that's not right no just this the world map the world map i i it's i i wouldn't like to hazard a guess it might be more than three years i don't know it might be more so today i'm gonna play this once and once only and we're gonna see if i can beat seventeen thousand seven hundred and three i'm not going to be taking multiple goals i'm gonna play it there's gonna be a 30 second time limit and whatever score i get i get so if i get a terrible guess to begin with um i'm gonna have to rectify that and try and crest that mark so you guys will be able to play along uh just for the hell of it just to see how you compare let's copy that i'm going to do that again time limit 30 seconds i can move i can pan and i can zoom and we will make that link again and this is it i i i'm not sure how this is going to go what i'll do on this video i'll have two attempts at this so this video will be called something like can i beat early geo wizard well you will have seen it on the title here we go geo wizard from the grave trying to beat his former self but that's something you didn't think you'd be seeing here we go right 30 seconds what do we got here i can move so right citadella this has got to be dear me1 me1 is that majorca menorca i'm going menorca yeah wow that's going to be a great first round isn't it oh my goodness i'm going to smash my former self i'm going to dick him i'm going to murk him murk him in mercado s mercado four nine eight one could this be no this isn't gonna be a record of any note not least because i'm gonna it up on the next rounds but i don't think this is really a an established record to even make but uh either way what a great start let's let's continue okay does help to move doesn't it so this feels like the states it's lagging a bit could be canada 60 would that be 60 kilometers no that would be 60 miles per hour so i am going to go oh god this could be quite bad to be fair i've gone montana that could be really i've moved it good move good move um i thought it was the reverse then of fates but no that's a good move i inched it further from montana oh no i'm still in montana there to be fair i'm in the flat head reservation um but i've moved it from over here somewhere and it was in the end washington i was right to say that there would be a 60 miles an hour sign rather than a 60 kilometers out because that would just be crazily slow for a road like that if you're not following kilometers per hour would be in canada yeah do you know what that's quite a few points to lose to be fair that's hit home a bit that god yeah all it takes is one guess here guys and and it's out i'm out so i really need to be consistently better than that i can't be any worse than that every round so here we go i could really do with a big points haul here on this next one with leaving two rounds to go oh man so it's dotted lines either side oh god i think i'm gonna i think i'm gonna fail here it is europe isn't it what are these mountains is it alps i'll go alps and i'll say around here in france god i'm rusty i don't know it could be the pyrenees oh that's great that is great i've got to admit i love the feeling of not having played in months i haven't played in months maybe since may or april i'm not sure so almost half a year and just coming back and still having something still having it a bit um four seven five seven that is exactly what i wished for isn't it just a big chunk of points on that third round i'm gonna move on that was the alps and it was france and i was 46 miles away number four are we gonna have to do this twice are we gonna have to attempt this twice or even three times that's britain what city is it don't say i'm gonna get a one in britain swindon north star swindon i'm going to go into swindon and i'm going to go ah where is it there it is north star that'll do we were actually quite far out there we were we're in a business estate rather i thought we might be on in one of those areas kind of just around the city center but a bit further out but that is um wow four nine nine one points 1.7 miles quite lucky to get britain quite lucky to get britain i won't lie but this is my first go this isn't me having a few goals like i sometimes used to final round what's my score already i've already done it i've already done it and it's a classic old site that we used to get so many years ago it's the right hang on i haven't got time to ramble is this mongolia the sun is that way which is um i'll try mongolia but it could be kazakhstan i don't know don't really know where you would get this i'm sure this is the mongolian pack on the back of the car and it is and we're not really that far away what a great way to end it four two seven one points that leaves us on a cracking score i bet that's a score i've never achieved on this um format before two two two two four i don't know if i've ever achieved that score on this format but that's only because i may not have played it too many times twenty two thousand two hundred and twenty four uh well that leaves us with quite a short video doesn't it what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna quickly check what my best score recorded is give me a moment yeah i've done a lot of diverse world 30 second per round i never made it for the for the regular old uh format of geo guess i probably didn't know how to make a playlist at that point but what we'll do is we'll presume that's the highest score i've ever got and we'll see if it was a fluke we'll make sure that it wasn't a fluke here we go again i'm going to do this once more the answer was firmly well the answer so far is firmly yes yes i am better than my former self or at least i was 10 minutes ago this one will cement it this will say unequivocally yes here we go here's our next uh url i will paste them both in the description here we go oh my god what's this this is britain again isn't it wrestling oasis academy we've got a train station do i know this place oh let me read it sheer ness where is she and ness get in there quick tom where you going where are you going to denmark we're there aren't we oh you bugger you've denied me a perfect score four nine nine nine what can i say i i didn't look at the it didn't feel right i didn't feel like we were by uh this stuff here i just didn't look at the compass oh man how lucky is that i saw at the last minute signed to maidstone and that's in kent i thought sheerness might have been in kent but i wanted to make sure wow 499 bit gutted won't lie and we are recording things just get better and better moving on second round let's see if we can beat that last score right the sun is firmly in the sa no it's not in the south ca canada right this i'm going to need to pull something big out the bag here we're in canada oh how blurry is it it's so laggy okay i'm gonna have to go around there somewhere oh it's great it's fantastic i went the other side of toronto um things were getting laggy there i apologize about that i wasn't sure how hilly or flat it is around here so i i deviated i went a bit further afield than toronto i figured it was too flat but that's complete it's not like there were mountains or big hills around so we were on the outskirts of burlington is where we were near hamilton very populated area isn't it excellent looks lovely by the way looked like some real prime real estate eh right round three and it's been very europe and north america so far or is it or is it where is that soul it's in the south so we are i believe in the states but honestly i just don't know miles per hour you've got to get in there tom this is a bit silly oh man i oh no that was bad yeah that's bad that was actually oregon can you believe it and that's another way in which i'm differing from my old self i actually i've i've started to call it oregon now and not a reagan as i called it from ages 5 to 25. um a bit longer than that um yeah that was tough i knew i realized i'd clicked in a completely flat place actually that time uh and just as the time ran out i figured we had to be more west than that because none of these none of this midsection really ticks the box but i'm not sure i would have gone oregon maybe i would have gone idaho or utah if i'd have thought about it which would have been a lot better points wise we've lost a lot of points that there is some reputation on the line here because on my second attempt i'm in serious danger now of getting a lower score than 17 773 was it hopefully we won't have to check right is this australia oh god well if i'm if i'm not getting the right country and it's australia then i really am buggered  baggage mate definitely uh oh my god the time's running out man where's the sun i think i've i think i've screwed this right up it's probably new zealand yeah it is i have totally look at that 880 points i've totally screwed this up what's our score we can do it i keep can we this is the last round right we need to get this we need to get this where is this what's this grange road i believe oh my god oh no i'm not better i'm not better than my old self i thought there was a grange road in sydney what was our summary oh see grange road sydney look how far out it is i can't i cannot profess to have uh to to have seen that in the center of sydney i'm just gonna have to accept guys that we need a third one don't we it need no it needs to be it needs to be best of three it does it needs to be best of three i've i've lost one quite badly i've won one quite well it has to be this is the decider this decides it um i should have just left it at one well there you go you've seen why i no longer i'm interested in entering tournaments because i'm bloody useless these days right here we go this is the last one this is the decider this is well i'm excited i'm nervous and excited you'll have three urls to play here we go this is plenty for you to be getting on with while i'm out in america eating corn dogs here we go last game if i do this i'm better than my old self if i'm not i still am but i'm not for the purposes of this here goes oh brazil i think but see one thing i did wrong was i was talking when the time was running out i can't be doing that somewhere in brazil i mean i'm right it was brazil i knew it even before we saw the signs but famously one of the hardest countries to accumulate points and it's just a measly 2 301 the next rounds need to be better we all know that first game was was favorable right this kind of seems familiar in a way it's got to be one of the canaries or something it's gotta be hasn't it ah or do i go portugal i've got to get in there oh i'm going to go canaries but this could be so this could be so wrong points wise oh thank god come on it was la palma la palma there we were on the edge of a volcano basically um they're quite distinctive but i wasn't sure oh look at those rivers how they all link up that's weird how does that work then let's not get distracted round three and we are in europe and it feels historical it feels kind of french it feels like we might not lose too many points famous last words if i can just move around a bit comedy in oh man well do you know i don't actually know i'm gonna go to luxembourg city it's probably france it's probably paris yeah why didn't i go paris i don't know i don't know the less the less said about that the better really um four one two six points i knew that there was that safety cushion i'll never know why i didn't go paris i think if i had a few more seconds to think about it perhaps i would have done perhaps not we are on the fourth round we're looking good but we really need some luck on these last two rounds we need not bad luck put it that way oh is this canada i think i think canada let's go there no it's the us always quite hard to i'm sure there were clues there in those signs or maybe even the road something on the road markings that did differentiate but landscape-wise very similar um not too far away mercifully if if you rewind the video there all i could see was that so i clicked there if i could see more of it on the map i may have may have clicked up here and knocked myself out the game pretty much so we'll be we'll be about two and a half thousand maybe three thousand points shy so we need we need to do something here it's more like three thousand oh dear oh no i'm bricking it i'm absolutely bricking it now maybe don't brick it i'm thinking thailand but honestly and i'm not moving down the road at all i'm gonna go on the border of thailand and cambodia i'll go sort of there this could be totally wrong oh yes come on it's thailand it's more near the border of lao but i cannot tell you how delighted i am if i got that one wrong if that was like colombia or something or even philippines my reputation would have just been laying in shattered pieces on the ground pretty much uh it's it's somewhere in limbo but i rescued it from from disaster 18246 that's nice that's consistent they're all clustered nicely together could have done with the paris points looking back um but it didn't matter in the end um the jury is out the verdict is in i am comfortably better than i was in 2016 um when i made my 11th video uh but yeah hope you enjoyed that that was an interesting thing um an interesting experiment for me one that didn't take too much time to do and hopefully to edit which is perfect because i'm just playing such catch-up trying to get everything prepared for how not to travel america whilst releasing dribbling britain episode two and getting all the bonus footage out uh so thank you for your patience during this lonely september i hope it's uh turning out to be a good month for you thank you all for watching this um sorry it's not more and i will see you hopefully upon my return take care ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 39.94126510620117, "lng": 4.113644599914551}, {"round": 2, "lat": 47.1252326965332, "lng": -123.10041046142578}, {"round":

"evening everyone who is up for some classic play along Geo guesser I know I am um I'm gonna take a punt on this map that I've just discovered it's like the geodetective map but apparently it's perfect um it's created by guiros he reckons 25k score is always possible but some rounds are harder than others meta knowledge is not required well that suits me and the compass is never wrong right we're going to play it with panning and zooming of course but no moving because that's how these maps are intended to play just before we start though folks I now have Instagram I didn't really want to get Instagram for quite some time but the reason I've ended up getting it is um purely to make links to find fellow adventurers content creators uh you know filmmakers musicians and sponsorship people uh businesses just so that I can Elevate the channel to the next level in terms of my Adventures so there'll be lots of snaps of classic moments from my Adventures on there it's mainly revolves around my real life stuff there's not going to be much Geo guesser stuff but I thought I'd let you guys know anyway just in case you wanted to follow me so the link will be in the description along with the instructions to play along with this video Let's see what this map is all about and let's see if I can get a perfect score that is what I'm aiming for here very much so now already here without even panning are we seeing a sort of pink Hue to these registration plates putting us in Belgium I don't know we've got a Tesla a Fiat a Mercedes a Volkswagen and a Volkswagen a Volkswagen Volkswagen Citron and a mini so I'd say pretty Belgian let's have a look over here liftgasoned something West Stark at Stell West yeah that sounds pretty oh there we go there's the be welcome loot sounds pretty Belgian so this could be like usted or I'll have to look on the map actually I can't remember Haven Master usted yeah usten so it's zebruga is the one I was trying to think of zebruga and usted the ports that lead into Belgium with these massive wide canals um so this one isn't too hard I mean I'm wondering whether this map is easier than the usual one but we can definitely get this used end yeah in the New Port because I I know these places because when I did cycle down the up the coast uh I should say I went through a lot of these places Japan  Dune was it and I remember getting to some big rivers that I couldn't cross but usten is much further up here it is so we should be around here no we thought we're up by the beach so we're further up so we should be there I would have thought what's this baldy doing see the Lifeguard oh no he's the toilet uh attendant very different jobs okay let's go in uh yeah I'm happy with that cool five yards amazing so ah straight away I think I know where that building is I think it's in Malmo the Turning torso it's called oh there you go look so it's definitely the right building that I was thinking of the Turning torso I mean it's a pretty cool design but it it's one of those buildings it seems that they clad it in white and it kind of gets a bit grubby after a while there's a couple in Birmingham that aren't that old they're only like 10 15 years old and they already look quite tired looking but maybe it's kind of the the maybe it just needs a bit of a clean or maybe it's the imagery anyway so we're in Malmo I presume so this is another one that won't be hard for me I'm just trying to figure out if there's any other giveaway clues that say Malmo because that really would no I don't think there is that's good that means it's not like a totally easy map um and this shouldn't be too hard for me to find within Malmo because we should be able to see like the the shadow of it I think it's near the sea but it either way it should if it's not the the shape of it we should be able to see the writing um the the label for it see if we can actually see the C because I thought it was by the sea but it might not be it's very flat is it way over here no I had this idea ah there it is it is near the sea turning torso iconic twisted and sculptured Tower block so we should be there if I line the compass up yeah that is where we are that Road is closed why is that one closed I think they've made it into cycle paths have they who knows um but yeah that is us four yards this time we're gonna go five four three two one that'll be some achievement oh my goodness we're up on a building this reminds me of the other map I used to play bird's eye bird's eye view this could be harder this look at the colors of these houses what are they huh I have no idea at the moment I need a challenge I need this to be a bit more challenging for me and I think this is oh look at that building we've got a ferris wheel insane buildings that one over there I've got an idea but it's nothing more than an absolute Punt and McDonald's down there so these buildings first of all at first I thought they look and they do look quite Norwegian or Icelandic or even sort of somewhat Slovakian you know Eastern European but this obviously isn't um I mean if you look at these buildings just don't think it's I don't think it's Eastern Europe just look at these and I think look how spread out they are is that something you would find in Eastern Europe like Warsaw or you know Kiev or something I don't think so and certainly not I mean this is obviously not somewhere like I might be wrong but I don't think this is somewhere like Kiev because it just goes out into this Barren land for me this looks like somewhere more like sugar bat is probably my is an option this is a fascinating building ah there is there is Cyrillic so that is Russian or Cyrillic language script and there is the giveaway guys there's a bloody flag it's um it's in Kazakhstan so I wasn't a million miles away but it will be well what is the capital these days is it Astana gotta be hasn't it they've changed the capital a few times but we've got water over there to the east doesn't really add up we should have a river the ishim river there's a river the water to the sorry we should have water to the West sorry if I said East which I can't really see but we should be able to get this there should be a sort of Valley in the Middle with not much on it that would be that bridge and then there'd be one big main road hmm unless that was the bridge Presidential Park just trying to size it all up guys and see if this actually is the place because at the moment I'm not sure I'm thinking not but I'd say we would be there is there is there a McDonald's here can't see one we're not on a building by the way I think we're just you know it's Drone footage and then that huge Palace there Sultan mosque but that just leads right out of town without bending around so look around a little bit a little bit more [Music] opening my ideas up to the idea that the compass is wrong now as well so like for example if we were in our starter us being on this side wait a minute yeah that's right the compass is completely wrong ah damn you um okay so yeah we're there that I think anyway yeah that will be the Triumph astani so we're probably about there there's the McDonald's well I should have I that I to be fair I should have um realize that as a possibility a lot earlier but part of that is on the map maker he did say that it was all a hundred percent of the compasses were correct and I've just noticed oh no I thought that said Astana on it so it is acetone of course we're in line with the edge of that building so I would say we're more like there um but this might not be totally accurate we're also in line with sort of that so I would say there uh let's try it two yards Ah that's so good and that isn't three yeah of course that is stupid of me not to explore that possibility but there you go so yeah you can see the road heading out of town there this one that one completely straight I got there number four I need a glass of water let me know if you got that I'm sure many of you did but were there any of you that went down the same path as I did and just didn't consider that the compass could be wrong let me know did that Scupper your game because I'm still on a perfect score at the moment so that I believe is the Taiwan flag that is some bloke from Taiwan um Chinatown branch office ah just realized where we might be I think we might be in San Francisco well I mean that is a clue um doctor's son yats sin Memorial Hall of San Francisco so I did think it didn't have a very Taiwanese look to it um or Chinese for that matter so yeah we're in we're in Chinatown San Francisco which I've had on another map before but on this occasion yeah they've definitely put us here on purpose to throw the cat amongst the pigeons Taiwan flag is is in support of Taiwan who are imminently gonna be invaded by the ruthless evil China and it's accompanied by American flags um heartfelt things I mean yeah we don't need to look around too much I mean we could do a bit of old school you know Geo guess so let's take the piss out of people within reason within reason I used to go a bit too hard didn't I because I was a small Channel I can't really do that anymore but this guy's haircut is standing out at that point you just you just shave it off don't you that's the general consensus um International dragon and lion dance what is that because funnily enough when I was in San Francisco um when kovid was just actually in its early days February 2020 we did see a lion a Dragon Dance coming down the street as part of some Festival so maybe that's where they store the the thing um yeah we're ready I think I'll wait anyone else [Music] you got lucky so I just saw Sacramento so that will be the street won't it and they're about to head into a tunnel and it's heading south although as we've learned we can't fully rely on the compass clay Sacramento let's get in there it's up here somewhere Japan Town Civic Center it's up here here we go Chinatown Sacramento is there clay there's clay and there's Sacramento but we don't know which which street we're heading up north to south wise but if we find this tunnel then that should be it so we should be that's a tunnel isn't it yes Stockton tunnel can't see any other tunnels particularly so I would say that's right we can also try and find some establishments Central Chinese High School and the Memorial Hall there it is Central Chinese Chinese Central High School and can't see the Memorial Hall but that's good enough for me and we're right by this bus stop I mean we're in the middle of that I'd I'd be happy with that guess let's see if we can get one meter oh it's six it's bloody six and it's wrong um but that is 5 000 points we are now on 20 000 points we're on for the Perfect Score we just need this final round to finish it all off who else is with me on that who else is perfect let me know right that feels like Island I don't know oh let's look at the sign Castle Town Foxdale Saint Mark's can't be island because we've got the yellow number plate at the back it's not driving on the right it's not that's not terrible driving it is parked up uh so this is this is probably Northern Ireland we got there um look at that old Renault Laguna kind of half half-heartedly souped up or is this Scotland and I don't think I don't know I honestly don't know Castle Town Foxdale Saint Mark's this might be tricky you know this actually might take a while and be quite tricky to to get I think we start in Northern Ireland because that was just what it felt like I thought I had it then Cookstown if we're in Northern Ireland it shouldn't take us too long because we're bi some pretty high ground as you can see over there trouble is it's quite yeah we can kind of see some High Ground here but these places castletown Saint Mark's foxtail could all be quite small an insignificant and hard to find on the map Castle town sounds like the biggest but I don't know okay I haven't found anything yet but I swear I do recognize castletown so I'm just gonna have a quick skip over to Scotland I'm gonna look sort of Castle downtown I mean just looking at the buildings here I mean we I'm not ruling out the north of England to be honest I mean they're not exactly Scottish or Irish I mean castletown is quite Northern Irish but yeah I'm not ruling anything out I mean it could literally be that we're appear somewhere or maybe even further south Yorkshire even Lincolnshire Kent no definitely not Kent um God but in that case we really have got a ridiculously potentially drawn out search on our hands something that I'll have to speed up hugely uh and possibly even just have a stab up just have a guess up um right wish me luck there is no point talking over any of this now I'm just gonna be searching on the map for hopefully a reasonable time because I've got lots of editing to do here we go [Music] can't be up here it's not Welsh enough there's no Welsh anywhere oh my God I think I've got it Castle town could it be that we are in the Isle of Man I'm not sure you know if we see a Saint Marks then yeah but it would make sense so castletown is that way so we would be up here Saint Mark's foxtail sweet some of you will have will have known from the word go where we were then and fair play to you um I only really know Douglas and peel and Ramsay but yeah many of you will know castletown I mean culturally it probably isn't that different to there's probably crossovers with with Ireland and they do have an ancient language on this island the Isle of Man called manx which I don't think is spoken very much but um is still spoken I think by some old fogies um a long way to continue so we're looking at Foxdale is down there some Marx's North doesn't really make sense no yes Marx is straight up there it's a bit odd could we be no awkward positionings they are I've got to say we're on a main road so some marks don't say the compass is wrong on this wait that's that's confused me no they're not in the they're not pointing in the directions I thought they were Castle town is down this main road foxtail is up there so yeah we're there probably I thought it was the other way around with some marks and foxtel uh yeah I think so is there some sort of Junction up there yeah possibly that bends around yeah um I'm fairly sure that that will be it just don't want to get this wrong no it's got to be isn't it it's got to be so marks is just over the way there and the road slightly at an angle yeah I'm doing it we actually on the junction yeah final round there it is two yards never got the one yard unfortunately but how can you when it's off the road view summary there it is that was good the Kazakhstan one definitely tested me I'm not bitter about the compass map maker it added it did add an extra bit of challenge um yeah it did to be fair I've never had it where I've been so certain that the compass is right um I'm just glad it it wasn't some smaller town I would have been there all day that was a good old bit of uh Detective work there good old play along um maybe I'll play that again maybe I won't maybe the old detective map is better let me know if you want to see that one or whatever you want to see recommend me some great maps that will really just just if anyone knows the ultimate detective map you know where it's got just the right amount um for some really magnifying glass out kind of rounds um and like each other's comments if you know them and think that they're talking sense basically um also let me know how you did as always in the comments and sign up to the Instagram there's going to be lots of images little short clips and uh descriptive paragraphs to accompany them

everyone welcome back and thank you for returning to the channel for your weekly dose of geography um I thought it would be fun partly because I'm swamped with editing and I need a video that that will be quick to edit but I genuinely did think it would be fun and interesting to go back to the old days and have a go at the old world map the default world map um that Geo guesser made themselves right at the beginning it's the one that I got my famous 35 minute at the time I believe record-breaking time on um about six years ago but it's a map that quickly fell out of favor because it's just very heavy on you know Brazil Russia United States Etc since then people people have branched out to things like diverse World Etc but I thought why not have a go at this see what score I can get with it with a sort of three minute per round timer um which is the kind of thing I used to do years ago and you guys play along and see how you compare to my score just see where we're all at yeah I think it'll be interesting um an interesting little experiment don't know how it's gonna go but let's make the challenge got the timer on we'll be able to move around there's not going to be a perfect score believe me that would be a miracle um there's gonna be it's going to be just a case of guessing really on a couple of them if we're in remote areas I don't know let's give it a go here we are first one and that's Britain straight away you can see the registration plate it's Britain so let's really try here let's uh Chelmsford can we read that Chelmsford Chesterfield haven't really got time to stop and really try and read that if there's a bin that's really close then we can do it it feels Parkinson feels like it we could be near the sea I don't know why uh Brooks Parkinson come on we can do this we have time I have been playing a bit of UK recently to get my position back on the leaderboard Essex so that would be Chelmsford then crematorium I'm not going to go back I'm going to keep going down the road because we need we need to find signs what's this that could be good prompt no Crompton and Co not good enough it's very tempting to read some of these signs Essex County Council again not great Chelmsford Chelmsford Crompton Street I'm gonna Gamble and say that we are in Chelmsford because a minute and a half on the map isn't isn't a fat lot so cromptons it's a big place great bado and we ah yes riddle we've got it guys we've got it right I'm gonna go back we've got plenty of time plenty of In Time mate plenty of time there's the England flag flying it's coming home no I'm sorry but it is no it's really not um so that puts us ah I'm gonna have to rejog my memory of these street names I'm sorry Rooks this is the roundabout isn't it so yeah Rooks so we will be about there who wears amberlo candles Amber I think she's down the road she's delivering candles um I think that'll be it that little Gap there oh look at that two yards with 30 seconds to spare now I said a perfect score wasn't on the cards are we recording we are don't know if you are but I am um it's now all of a sudden a lot more likely let's try it this would be a first for me and this doesn't look beyond the realm of possibility can you imagine okay so we're heading north we've got this sign here sepsi oh my God what is that then got to be hungry hasn't it no it's Romania BT leasing right if we can get a welcome to sign here what's good is because I've played so much you know 10 seconds per round no moving scrolling zoom in and uh you know battles with people I've got a good idea straight away where we might be that just seems really Hungarian there it's fun to George that could mean yeah you've got to be near the border got to be haven't we don't think that necessarily means we're going to find it though the capital of cultural culture I don't quite know what to do it's fun to what is that oh that's the place casseni zotio I've just got a search on here guys sunny koseni I don't know if I'm making the right decision here but it's it's a bit of a gamble I don't know how far the Romanian comes in if you know what I mean it could come in quite far ethnically there are a lot of sorry the Hungarian I mean it's been a while since I've rambled and searched at the same time Casino is that actually the place um I think I've buggered this up should have said it's too late now I should have searched for more Road names and whatnot a road name a Road number foreign just quickly look around oh there are Hills there are Hills I've gone there oh my god look how far that goes in and it's a big place I don't believe that svantage casino oh I touched on it didn't I I said the hungarians ethnically because I I know a girl knew a girl who was she said she was wrote she called herself Hungarian but you know she was from brassov so yeah that makes sense there must be a good pocket of because that was definitely Hungarian language so some of you will have got that some of you will have literally yeah you will have got that that's not a hard round damn that is a missed opportunity but we we Soldier on that is disappointing at least we got the country but wasn't hard right concentrate Focus focus on the next round top fayas colombianas Richie Saint Pasadena Texas Pasadena Texas is that where we are then do I go in and search for that does feel like we could easily be in Texas but where's Pasadena's that's got to be hasn't got to be what I would have thought it was or it is it still is down this way Pasadena's like towards towards the Border what's that called just Brownsville where's Pasadena's that better I better not have got that wrong what about up here El Paso Pasadena El Paso uh we're doing it again aren't we well I am you probably aren't Pasadena Pasadena Texas I mean if we can get you know Pasadena historic Pasadena if there was any sort of I can give myself 45 seconds to search for should I be on the map I haven't done this in so long it's hard to know whether I should be on the map or looking for sign posts to the next town Pasadena historic I'm going in man I think going in is the right way to go let's try it up here first uh okay Pasadena wacko they call me the wacko kid do I have to talk while I search I think I do to an extent but I'm just going to say a lot of words just random words just to keep you amused while I search with every fiber in my body for Pasadena but it just ain't rearing its head surely it's I've got to put the marker down somewhere Amarillo Pasadena no I have not found it and it's in Houston ah historic Pasadena well I I was never going to find that it's a suburb of Houston Houston and we do indeed have a problem no it's not funny it's not funny for me it'll be funny for most of you who have almost undoubtedly beaten me on that round if you saw the Texas sign some of you won't have which is fine uh but this is the point of this this is my first game and we're just seeing how I do it's very raw so moving on we've got nothing to compare it to this time um a few weeks ago I I played I actually played against 2016 Geo wizard but it's not like that but it's it'd be interesting to see what score I do end up on this could be okay Smart Water ah I never have enough time to search for these roads n11 we can do this this is South Africa you can tell by the yellow and the white in the middle and this distinctive green sign with the yellow uh Road names I never have time to explain those things these days either um the 11 here we go we're over this side so we found the n11 we now want to look for the five seven two although I'm always tempted to have a quick look for these place names couldn't see them I found grobbler's doll no groblers Bridge this is all distracting so 573 we've got I bet you I don't find it I bet you earning money ah no I found it we didn't Shake on it five seven two and eleven straight on keeping one eye on the tie time groblers brug a brook means Bridge doesn't it surely so we might be able to get this spot on can't see beauty we can see so yeah this is the junction without a shadow okay maybe maybe there's a few Shadows some terrible jokes going on here today but I don't know what else to to say really other than that is correct and we are to try and get this right oh that's so we're actually there then 31 yards will will do it for us and this is the oh this is the last round oh my goodness okay well I hope you enjoyed this folks we're going to try and end on a high here and Maplewood as predicted it's USA heavy what did I tell you at the start this is definitely USA didn't have Russia thank God um and but we did have South Africa which is fairly common and the UK which is relatively common too basically the more roads there are in a country the more likely it is to crop up so I'm thinking that this is the USA but not too far south I don't think maybe I don't want to say just yet I'm thinking maybe New York I could be totally wrong there's a lot of pine trees Brookhaven it's not gonna give us anything I was having a good old look there because I don't think I'm going to see a lot else but you never know we might get to a main road but really I've got to go on feel here and I don't think we're very far south here at all I think we're this could even be Canada but I should know if it's Canada or not judging from oh hang on that that'll give it away 25 miles an hour so it's America but it's far north in America I think snowmobile route right a minute left Ellison Bay Anderson Bay Pottery snowmobile route now that is seriously far north so I'm thinking okay do you know what I'm gonna gamble I'm gonna gamble here right check this out it's very far north up here Ellison Bay let's see if we can find something Whitefish Bay Sturgeon Bay Green Bay no I think it's very unlikely we'll find an Ellison we've got 19 seconds left to do it as well what about up here it's Minnesota Wisconsin we haven't found Ellison that's gutting and we've got seven seconds left but yeah I am gonna leave that I'm gonna go there I'm pleased with that should have left it where it was that would have been not insane but a very good guess because I was over here somewhere but look at that Ellison Bay you would some of you who saw that could you see that as I zoomed over this area of Green Bay but yeah that's that's actually not Michigan that's Wisconsin yeah very cold regions um and that guys is the game that's it that's 21733 I do as I say I don't know how good or bad that is I actually think that's not amazing because actually perfect score was possible there thinking about it it really was wasn't it because that one was definitely possible the Texas one was without a shadow of a doubt that one was because that one's hard but but you know if you found Ellison Bay wow that's I don't think the odds I mean you tell me I don't think the odds are very high of getting a game like that because if you think about my record breaking game uh I keep saying record-breaking game that was at the time I don't think anyone had a faster time but that's just on YouTube Someone probably did but that took me 35 minutes if I'd have done that that I mean that's I think that that could have been done in 10 minutes that game so I think that paints a picture of just how um lucky that seed was so please let me know how you did on that did you get a perfect score and talk me through how you did it you know don't just lie um because I do think that was possible I really do and that's it let me know what you thought of today's vid guys sorry it's not something more intense or impressive but I enjoyed that it was good to get back to my roots I would say tune in soon for a trickier geodetective and I'll see you there

the who wants to play some play-along geoguessr I thought you did let's do it let's play a new map brutalist architecture I like brutalist architecture I mean I wouldn't want our cities full of it but I think the best examples of those 70s or 60s concrete monstrosities should be preserved I think they're a very interesting portal into a very exciting phase of our history and I think if we bulldoze them all we'll regret it this map created by Geo Fred based on Damien gossett's website architecture website should include most of the best examples of brutalist architecture 893 in 66 countries now if any of you guys have not yet played along to one of these play-along videos it's really good fun and it's really easy check the instructions in the description below it's pretty damn simple and that is pretty much all there is to say perfect score is possible but very unlikely I would say on a map like this but who knows let's give it a go and find out no time limit no moving let's go wow look at that for a starter that is that is something isn't it I love it when they've been uh renovated you can tell that that one's been sort of scrubbed up and they've added new windows looks like it's in a prime position so they've possibly made it into Apartments let's look around and see where we actually might be I love the cut those it's star wars-esque isn't it and it's Swagger let's just build a huge block of concrete I guess I mean it was the Space Age wasn't it the 60s oh my God it's Chicago look at these is it the Sears Sears Tower or the Willis building or let me know is it the John Hancock building I get confused with them all uh more concrete over here less polished and yeah we're on the river it's just kind of dawned on me we're on the river we're on one of the waterways in Chicago um let's get in the map and see where this is according to the compass and the sun would correlate we are South of the center or where's the other really tall building the other the other black one the kind of looks similar maybe it's being obscured um yeah let's get into Chicago not Chicago as I sometimes call it um right so it's I would say judging by the layout of this that we're kind of down here somewhere see if we can find the outline of that concrete Beauty is it that one I don't think so there actually aren't a whole lot of bridges down here which is kind of odd so that would put us more like here yeah oh wow I think this is it but look at the shape of it and let me just check so it's that snakes run it's like a big S so those are the very abrupt ends the end of the the snake and then it'll be the same on the other side there look that is I don't think I could have asked for a better brutalist piece of architecture to start things off um I'm guessing I'll be absolutely fine with that yet 10 yards I think the threshold is going to be 100 yards at least maybe even 150. so perfect score we're still on four well done if you started off with a perfect score um don't know if I'll keep that up because that was quite an easy round but let's move on oh my God look at this one seems like we're in Paris Bank popular Reeve De Paris so this could be quite hard to find but at least we know we're in the right City but that really is now that is a monstrosity that I love it though I absolutely love it like I know it looks ugly but it doesn't help really that all these trees are growing on it is that intentional I presume that's intentional because those will be people's balconies and I'm all for you know the growing of trees on buildings but that to me just looks like it's been engulfed by time and mother nature and there's a fine line isn't it between you know nice Greenery and weeds but this is I'm really in my element here I don't think I realized how much I that this kind of thing fascinated me but there you go let's try and get to the task so just trying to look for some Clues on here silly uh okay just scanning for Clues not gonna try and pronounce too much because my French pronunciation is not a great Rue something Perry now that's that could be useful rude Perry because I am going to try and get a perfect score but I won't completely break my back trying to do so Bank popular Reeve De Paris now I think that sag best clue don't think that's good so Reeve De Paris I mean Paris is technically wrong uh We're not gonna be able to read any of those okay this could take me a little while but we're just gonna get into Paris on the map and just have a little search because Reeve De Paris Reeve to Paris I'm just going to call it Paris okay because I'm English um it's it's entirely possible that we can we could stumble across this now I don't think we're gonna be in within that Central Ring Road partly because we haven't got like a 17th ah ah whatever it means a double r but I am going to search for a Reeve to Paris don't know what that would mean [Music] okay not finding a Reeve to Paddy and I'm also now starting to think that that might not be a place I mean it's entirely possible when you think about it Bank popular however thinking about it more I think that this I don't think that they'd build this too far outside of Paris it's the kind of thing you build relatively close to the city um but I'm not going to spend any more time searching for a place that may not exist uh so yeah I am going to just put the man down put the marker down we're not on Google Street View okay I am going to go about here but not before I check once more for a couple of Clues just I well any clue would be grand because you never know I might have missed something [Music] the only thing I can see that I didn't see before is this it looks like it's an ivry is that an area because if so that would be the best way to to fight it probably isn't it probably isn't but if it is so give me one minute while I look for that okay I give up that's my guess I is every so sane if I'd have just looked a bit longer but I thought I was going insane so I didn't bother looking any longer for that but E3 was the place I thought it might be because it looked kind of more of a local initiative rather than a private business so we're just outside the Ring Road we're obviously on the other side of the city to where I picked um and I don't think how this building looks massive it looks like it carries on all around here look which is incredible but I don't think Bank popular rhyth De Paris is probably a chain so that was I was probably barking up the wrong tree there but you know what 4908 ain't too bad some of you guys however will be on a perfect score because some of you will have heard of every or found it did you see the sign on the thing though on the billboard let me know okay there's our next one I know it's our next one because it said in the description that we should always be facing the monstrosity in question um that one is a monstrosity this there's no debate really and we're in France again so they really do have a knack the the frogs of building Concrete monstrosities in Britain it's our usual excuse is that a lot of the time the city's in question were bombed to Oblivion in World War II like Birmingham Coventry more so which gave rise to a lot of concrete 60s buildings which are now being demolished in their hundreds is that the case in France I don't know I don't know I don't think it was I don't think it needed to be bombed did it that much because they just took it over um anyway that's history lesson over how the hell am I going to get this this there's nothing really I don't think they can give it away so we've got to think about foliage how far north in France are we pretty far north is the answer to that is there any hmm are we in France for sure for sure Jordan de France yeah we got two separate businesses that are in French I was just thinking Garden of France could be you know in another country it kind of does look like the Czech Republic a bit but yeah I would say either near Paris again or Lille somewhere like that just based on the foliage pretty far north so I'm gonna make a guess and I'm gonna go I mean it's probably the outskirts of Paris but just for a laugh and just to give you guys a chance to beat me I am going to go outskirts of Lil let's find a road that correlates it's kind of like curving around this way so maybe I feel like we're a bit further out maybe like there and it's just south of Paris of course melon melon is where we were on a big old roundabout that is quite annoying because I was quietly confident is the truth 405 6 ain't the end of the world let's move on I'm hoping this there'll be one in Britain soon but it seems that we are in Europe on this occasion again and it's bloody France again isn't it Montmorency don't believe it I never had France down as a particularly big culprit for brutalist architecture and again it looks like it's gonna be I mean we've got that you know what's going to happen here don't you I'm gonna go near Paris and it's going to be Leon or something that's what's going to happen we do have an old wall here and we do have the odd tree look at that that tree there which and that there those bushes which could be further south but let's just gaze briefly upon the building in question it kind of reminds me of the the old library in Birmingham I don't know if any of you have seen that I'll put a picture of it up right now it's an absolute monstrosity I actually explored it when I was very drunk and it was quite dangerous actually when it was abandoned yeah that one kind of fans outwards as you saw but this one it's a much Tamer version it fans downwards if anything I imagine it's part of a hospital but I'm not sure right it's no fun if I go Paris I'm thinking that the the trees might be further south therefore I might go for Leon or I don't want to go as far south as Bordeaux or too loose or any of the others so I'll go Leon just to just to mix it up let's let's try that ah okay okay okay so actually my worst score of the day but I was right to go further south uh just clocking the foliage there Montpellier is where we were I didn't think for a minute we were that far south but that was the Direction departmentale Des will never know and we'll never care last round who's beating me many of you will be oh my God look at this have we got Britain finally I think we have I knew it I knew there'd be there's plenty of this stuff in Britain right I'm gonna get a perfect score on this round mark my words and that is not necessarily going to be easy but we've got Northwest cancer research City Center airport and widness so that would suggest Liverpool would it not that is absolutely You've Gotta Laugh at that what the is that actually part of a residential building is that that's offices or or a hospital or something but what's that that is one of the wow that is one of the most brutal shocking pieces of architecture I've ever seen it really is and I live in Birmingham so that really is something Epworth street is going to help us but not that much because this monstrosity is such a big Landmark on the map right witness let's let's get in the map here because I thought that was near Liverpool and I might be right ah so could we be in runcorn probably not because runcorn is in a city at least I hope it's not doesn't deserve to be uh five six one down here look so we're gonna be in Liverpool but this could be pretty hard to find airport as well where's where's the John Lennon airport there it is so we we could be we could be quite far in here so Northwest cancer research that's going to be fairly useful accelerator but this is the thing and I I'm fairly sure that's a hospital just just based on ah Liverpool City London Road Branch well that is that is one of the most useful bits of information you're ever likely to see on a British sign that is not something you often see on a fast food joint so we don't need to try and decipher that rubbish we can see it here London Road so usually it's just a phone number at best London Road so here we go we're going to be we're going to be around here somewhere that's Park Road does it say more Street [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm really struggling to find this so I can't lie I can't find London Road [Music] London Road okay so it's way up here that's gotta be it surely is it it's and it's it is the Royal Liverpool University Hospital we're not actually on London Road Mr Liang Ji uh we're on Prescott Street so probably update that at some point uh because we're right by Lula flower shop that was Moss Street not Moore Street um and that tops the lot in terms of outrageously concrete shabby looking buildings okay let's put our final marker down buff that was fun 22 957 was my score um I think spending a bit more time I could have I wouldn't have got it perfect because of the two later French rounds but the one Paris round would have heated up a bit but I don't think a perfect score on that was particularly possible look at that a spine of European concrete and then a little taste of uh Chicago there as well I'd say the Chicago one was the the the best looking the most impressive most brutal was the Liverpool One just about but the one in Paris in E3 in a way that got me excited the most I don't know why it's just outrageous shapes going on I hope you enjoyed that guys um maybe some of you are new to the channel but you clicked on this vid because you're interested in brutalist architecture um either way let me know if you want to see another one of these it interests me but it might not interest you so do let me know and as always I'll see you for the next one take care everyone ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 41.87194003646844, "lng":

we've got to move on but that is fascinating let's give this a go areas with tragic or disturbing backstories this could be a really interesting map welcome back everyone by the way um we're back with more Geo guesser after a little while out thanks to all the Adventure the adventuring wrist bombings murders I don't think I'm going to be able to monetize this hardly at all but oh well it's not all about the money industrial environmental and natural catastrophes mysterious events of any sorts it's time for you to take a dive into the areas with tragic or disturbing backstories almost all of which happened within the 20th and 21st century created by Phil ravenholm this could be a great map let's just Dive Right In I'm going no moving to give myself some sort of you know structure and restriction if you watching have never played along before now's your chance check how to do it in the description the instructions will be there it's very fun and it's easy to do I think we are recording so we can begin where are we gonna get here I can't panel Zoom I've done it wrong I could that be Chernobyl let's just have a look this this can be a warm-up Chernobyl Chernobyl where is it God this isn't going well I can't even find pripya pripyat ah I found chinob Chernobyl so where's pripya there it is I think I will just go prepare and oh there's the Chernobyl nuclear power plant yeah we'll go in here and I'll go this this isn't in the game this doesn't count and it's wrong anyway it's Moscow I have no idea what happened there maybe we can Google I'll Google them after the game or after each round yeah after each round this is your link let's go first one okay where could we be we've got a yellow number plate white number plate West Gate oh hang on a minute is this Nairobi the shopping mall God if it is then that really is uh doesn't get much more disturbing than that are we in Nairobi I figure it out we don't we don't have the usual Google car Westgate Shopping Center see I'm just Gathering Clues to see if we can get the country here there's a k there Kenyan no that's probably I mean Westgate Cinema you'll have to forgive me I know I've said this so many times but I haven't played geoguessr in well over a month um golden homes but yeah the registration plates I just can't remember whether my uh Kenya has yellow ones I don't remember it having it's really bad um but yeah we're in Africa it's you know English English language ah that is okay isn't it why aren't I going into the map and just going to Nairobi and trying to fight I'm sure it was the Westgate Mall I haven't actually explained what this potential tragic or disturbing moment in history was it was the shooting at the mall with the terrorists and that was in the description so I'm hoping terrible terrible event the scariest thing you can imagine there's a really good documentary on it but watch it at your own sort of risk because it is you'll never go to a mall uh again and not think about it um can't find it and I'm looking mainly in the West lavington Mall The Junction Mall Prestige Plaza Mall ington Shopping Center timore I mean bloody hell where is this thing got it Westgate Shopping Mall oh my God oh wow this really is heavy West Coast Shopping Center I'm happy to go there I can't see how that can be wrong really looking at it and it's right um I was thinking I might have to Google things if I don't know what happened but on this occasion I'd heard of this one so moving on and we're on a bridge we're on a big old bridge God I feel like this is the United States that's is that Pennsylvania badge maybe there's one but I don't think we're in Pennsylvania this is this could be one of these bridges that crosses you know maybe this one maybe it's this one Chesapeake Bridge tunnel hmm that's South and it bends around to the right let me see let me look let me just have a little scan for these Bridges [Music] I can't really find uh a bridge that looks the same and I don't I don't know of a disturbing or tragic incident that happened um I can't think of one that happened on a bridge unless maybe did this collapse or are we near New Orleans where you know maybe a hurricane happened and some cars were blown off I mean it's possible but feel like I would have heard of that we are also looking for something that juts out here but that's not right that's not right I'm quite determined to find this and then we will have to Google what happened here [Music] unless it's Fort Myers or somewhere around this area that got decimated by uh the last hurricane Ian how could I forget its name we could be around here very easily that looks yeah I mean it's Gotta Be It's gotta be so we should be heading slightly Northwest which we are the fishing thing the pier you can see there and it does look like it bends around towards us a little bit it gets bigger so yeah we are here definitely so that didn't take me too long to find I'm guessing well I'll Google it in a sec but the Sunshine Skyway Bridge I'm guessing something happened here during Hurricane Ian let's see if we can keep this perfect score going oh this is going to be hard because this is a long way talking big distances but I reckon about there should be good ah we've lost out on two points I should have carried on a bit further up um but I'm going to take a moment to Google this oh I'm wrong about hurricane Ian 1980 collapse oh my goodness the southbound span opened in 1971 was destroyed when the freighter 185 meter freighter what a freighter it's a it's a boat there it is collided with a support column during a sudden Squall what's a Squall increase in Wind yeah I know all about those causing the catastrophic failure of the whole Bridge six cars a truck and a Greyhound bus oh that's unlucky if you're on that plummeted 150 feet 46 meters into Tampa Bay resulting in 35 deaths the only survivor of the fall this is less tragic but just as interesting was Wesley McIntyre whose Ford Courier pickup truck bounced off the hull of the summit Venture and into the water McIntyre managed to escape his vehicle before it sank and he was pulled to safety oh my God how did he survive that I'm just trying to picture that car going and then falling a great height well we've got to move on but that is [ __ ] fascinating this is a good map number three when we're not on for the Perfect Score but I don't really care this is really cool yeah okay lugogo Cricket oval lakhani Motors it's all quite blurry can't really read that we've got yellow number plates the Google car I can't I don't know okay I'm I need to get out of geoguessimo trying to figure out where I am just based on what I see and think about what could have happened here could this be Uganda I'm thinking the Google car looks quite Ugandan and then I'm thinking the Ugandan genocide no that was the Rwandan Genocide Tom Jesus mate I'm sure bad things have happened in Uganda I mean maybe we are in Rwanda uh in a mad twist lugogo let's try and come on lugogo is there a lugogo no Kigali because I'm sure Rwanda has been added uh uh but if not where else could lugogo be assuming that lugogo is the town or the city maybe we are in Kenya they have some yellow number plates we've learned so maybe we are I do recognize lugogo maybe we are in Kenya something else terrible that happened in Kenya Maybe it is Nairobi again and you know there was another terrible incident suffered by the local people at the hands of al-shabab but the lugogo cricket oval wherever that may be you know I wouldn't be surprised lightning does often strike twice um is a famous phrase I think so yeah without spending massive amounts of time I am gonna just go Nairobi and I will just go here and it is Uganda why didn't I stick with that it's the Google car Tom the goddamn Google car lugogo more Kampala and talking of Google we've got to Google that yes now this is really bad uh left over 74 people dead and at least 71 injured after al-shabab terrorists exploded bombs in a fully packed Rugby field where soccer fans were watching the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals oh my God have I never heard of that that is really bad how did that not make the news I'm I'm sure it did but maybe it was just overshadowed by the actual ah I was in Newquay Nuki 2010 getting pissed my bad next round so I remember watching the final in there uh right what do we have here we are in Europe here I believe or definitely Eastern Europe could this be then I'm already thinking let's have a look at the cars skoda opal Volkswagen Audi opal opal Ford very German cars but it's not Germany very German cars though maybe we could be in Poland this could very easily be ah this is a memorial for something this could easily be World War II stuff trying to gauge the language there can't quite do it the Zeds there's a few Zeds kind of looks Romanian but surely not some dogs lying down here bloody up I find any dazius is that adatsia because that it could be or it could be a seat is that a datsia because if we've got datsias then yeah I think we are in Romania but what's that what flag is that we've got massive mountains over there huge ones that is a datsia I mean all you need is one or two datsis and you're basically in Romania so biggest mountains they look like they're up um no they could be down here but I think maybe we're up here I wonder if I can get this sarnetti zarnetti is it looks like the ozoneesti maybe could be the town judging by that really not sure though which way are the mountains they're in the south big mountains down here foreign [Music] it's almost impossible to find a town that you're not sure which word it is um based on maybe a few mountains nearby I think I could do it if I had hours um I'm just gonna go there guys oh man I was really looking down there as well zarnesty are you knob please don't tell me I went over that I will have done oh that's so annoying I was thinking it that was a good option down there I believe that's quite a Hungarian place ethnically so maybe it was some sort of let's find out I'm thinking it could be some sort of um genocide maybe amongst the hungarians and the Romanians that may have never happened let's go on the Tsar neste Wikipedia page ah no I'm totally wrong that never happened there was no one hurt each other everyone gets along fine this was it in nine in December 1939 which coincidentally was during World War II disaster hit the town as 24 tons of chlorine gas was spilled killing 60 even at considerable distance from the plant where a storage vessel failed wow so that's what that Memorial was for that is grim rest in peace the chlorine crew uh last round this has been interesting and it looks like we're in the USA here are we let's find out looks like a Chinatown nap street street cleaning could be in Canada sweet Kingdom dessert we're in a Chinatown I just said that already let's have a look this isn't this is pretty historic City I think I think it's eastern did you buy these buildings but could be wrong here we go building restoration something the past building the Future Okay preserving the past or some [ __ ] East Ocean City okay I like this this is testing me we don't have a major clue apart from we can rule out New York we can rule out Philadelphia why I hear you ask because of the number plates this is uh Vietnamese got a mixture of number plates I think Chicago can also be ruled out Washington Street uh yeah something something I haven't got it but something bad happened here I keep forgetting that something terrible happened in this street why why am I not looking at this Skyline that's ridiculous um what Skyline is that it's not you well we know we're not in New York I don't think that's Chicago but it could be what's LLC and what's jwg what do they both stand for that could be a clue it's not Seattle because you'd have the Space Needle it's not Toronto because you'd have the CN Tower okay we're deducing things here that is the most 60s font how Austin Powers is that Mass medical office yeah no wonder there uh giving that some renovation um keep that though keep that sign that's sick I've just realized where this could very very likely be a place I completely forgot about Boston come on give me nap give me Washington now come on now North Washington I know we're here now we've got to be we just gots to be oh no this isn't where the bomb went off it's not Boston I don't believe that I don't quite believe that man really I don't believe this where haven't I friggin looked Cincinnati cannot believe how much this is the most pathetic round I've done In My Memory um but it's okay I've wound up back at Seattle I really don't think we're in Seattle because of uh a couple of things no space needle there is just you know all sorts of wrong I found uh South Washington Street in a sort of Asian area the compass directions are wrong there's no nap I feel like having a nap quite frankly um so I'm just gonna click here and it is Boston you are joking me South Washington Street which is up here a friggin News Boston it stops and I couldn't see where it you know it just ended no sign of it but it must carry on here and down here and crucially that's where we were we're not even on knap street oh nap streets down there oh my God right what happened here surely the bomb didn't go off there because that that's too narrow let's find out this will be it the Pickwick Club collapse 1925. killing 44 people it was a nightclub the Pickwick nightclub opened in 1924 and a year later it had collapsed so it closed after a fire that occurred in another part of the building and that caused the collapse that is awful wow these are some serious disasters and tragedies that I never had even heard about and it's good because they're getting I'm digging them up in a good way I think and people are finding out about them and um because these things can just be forgotten or never even heard of by many people so that as we view the results was a great experience the score wasn't great and that last one it's going to go down as a bad round for me a bit of a Calamity but I don't really mind because that was an education I hope you learned a few things just as I did and I'll see you very soon for some more geography based videos I think next we'll do some geodetective see you there ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -1.257879060539173, "lng": 36.80355019926002}, {"round": 2, "lat": 27.616446671368735, "lng":

"hello how's it going everyone welcome back to the channel uh we've got some good old Geo guesser for you this evening and I thought this map would be quite fun Guinness World Records each location will be the location where a record was presumably set I don't know I only had a look at one so we've got to try and figure out obviously where we are that'll be the the sort of main thing but also a side challenge in this particular game will be trying to figure out which record that place holds the one I saw was pretty obvious but some of them may not be I don't know it might be a mixture I've got a bit of a cold by the way I'm sure you can tell but yeah let's have a good old play along shall we um it's been a little while if you haven't done it before instructions will be in the description give it a go it's great fun thank you to the guy who messaged me recommending this map and thank you to Century who created it in fact no I'll thank you at the end because it might be right here we go no moving for a bit of challenge bit of restriction and there we go there's a link and here's our first round and we've got a temple seems to be Indian looking but then there's a fair few white people this guy's got a Utah t-shirt on this guy's got a a maple leaf Canadian maple leaf it seems but we're definitely definitely not in the the U.S we're definitely not in Utah or Canada think it's safe to say zooming in here these look more Indian so presumably this is quite a touristy site in India Japanese women you could just tell you can just tell by the hats can you not am I right or wrong let me know in the comments we'll never know I suppose um Asian tourists although if we're in India then we are in Asia now this could be useful disco where does he look he looks like a local guide but he doesn't look Indian he looks possibly um well I'm now thinking based on his appearance that we're we're more likely in Cambodia or Thailand which would correlate with the trees these tall palm trees and yeah I've never been to either country I've never been to any of those temples so um yeah I don't know the difference basically so this I'm now thinking is probably a temple in Cambodia hmm I wonder if we can find out from this I can't read the I can't tell the difference between the the script of Thailand and Cambodia at the best of times even when it's clear as day on a sign that's Latin script so I don't know what I'm talking about I'm just trying to look for a flag or something on on his person he's a policeman isn't he somewhere between a policeman and a Boy Scout um the Hat does have the colors of both countries flags in terms of the record this could be the biggest temple in the world couldn't it I mean it's it's big and square um so if they're counting this structure even that structure I mean even that is huge so if I was to yeah put money on it I'd say biggest temple in the world or biggest Buddhist temple in the world but I will make a guess and we'll find out afterwards and I'm going into Cambodia and call what I think is a very famous one we're looking West there so that would put us you're gonna let me put the marker down that might come in useful that would put us there but then that carries on straight so that rules out and call what but we've got this one here as well Terrace of the elephants Bayonne Temple so that we could be there um and I can it's lagging it's lagging that's annoying I can look at the shape of these buildings on there look because we are going for a perfect score here and that to me adds up oh I don't know actually I don't see this one here that is that looks huge so that looks like a really impressive Temple I just don't see this or this coming out so I'll have a quick look for another Temple and get back to you oh wait a minute I think I've got confused here I hadn't zoomed in enough I actually think we are here although I don't see that path there we've got that one there and we're actually still inside this whole area and then there's a moat so I was looking there we're actually here if we are here and that would make more sense I think um one two three yeah um yeah I think that one and that one will be those that one that one and that one will be that that and that and then we've got the two at the back yeah I think we are there um I think that would be very me to disregard this and move on but I've luckily I've noticed okay I'm guessing boom five thousand points 19 yards a great start um so yeah my guess is that this is the biggest I mean it says massive Temple with an ornate design I'm gonna say that it's the biggest Buddhist temple in the world but it could be a number of other things it could be the biggest moat in the world although we weren't next to the moat so that would be a bit silly biggest Buddhist temple in the world that's what I'm saying and we'll check them all at the end right here we go this one looks interesting we're in the Rockies I would say Canadian Rockies or oh no no maybe not we've actually got registration plates here that haven't been blurred for some reason is that the Idaho plate I I've forgotten it all Idaho I can I could believe it's quite a yellow Sandy Dusty color down there uh indicating planes hmm I think I might struggle here to get the well to get both the location and what the hell this is some really weird structures here look at that it's like a roof that opens up that's like Thunderbird that is could this be some sort of like space Observatory or something is it Idaho I think it is let's get in there you know it ticks the boxes for huge mountains some of the biggest mountains uh in in America I would say are we up towards Canada not necessarily not necessarily we could be we could be down here but my guess is that we are in in a really remote spot and this is some sort of Observatory I need to think outside of the box here with these records it's not just going to be biggest Observatory or highest altitude Observatory it could be the site where something happened maybe someone performed the longest paper airplane throw you know over there so I don't know what are these tubes what the hell are they fake snow machine would not buy a ski slope it's trying to deduce a few things yeah I need to consider that it was something that happened here but I just there's no point trying to guess that is the I'll have a little scan I'll have a little scan through the through the mountains here buffalo hump [Music] so I've been scanning Idaho now the mountains of Idaho looking for somewhere where there's a bit of a plane to the South mountains to the North and then but then more Mountains to the South beyond the plain I don't know I've been looking for too long probably but I'm just living in hopes of you know Young's Mountain Observatory basically or something something ah moral Mountain Lookout Museum maybe maybe yeah highest altitude Museum in the world let's try it no there's no way there's no way we were that far south that was an Arizona plate I don't believe we were that fast that is okay well I think we found out what the um it wasn't Observatory large binocular telescope Observatory so we'll say that it's the largest binocular telescope Observatory but the fact that that was in Arizona Southern Arizona we may have been looking at Mexico in the far in the far far distance is quite shocking and a little bit embarrassing because I said it looked Sandy it quite literally was sand it quite literally was Desert down there um obviously we were it was the winter way it had to be it had to be third round oh wow okay that looks pretty scary straight away I'm thinking Japan based on this building oh and that mountain yet that could easily be Mount Fuji this building as well reminded me of Japan let's just have a little look around oh oh yeah food Stadium good Stadium dude Stadium of the dudes are we recording we are but yeah there's the Japanese script information they've just got it in English as well that's cool yeah this is that this is our spectacle isn't it I'm just looking at the rest of the roller coaster looks like quite a new one just in case there could be anything else about it like most twists and turns it's not the longest it's not the tallest the newest isn't going to be a record so I think I think we're looking at this yeah most inverted drop on a roller coaster I would say look how it goes out at a 45 degree angle and then just so you'd basically it would look like you're going off a cliff you're not going to see any of the track and then it comes in yeah you'd have like G-Force lurching you forward out of the oh and then down you go very relieved so if that's about Fuji let's let's set to work that's South so that's kind of Southwest a bit let's get to work trying to find this place there's Mount Fuji Forest Adventure Fuji yeah yeah we could be here but Forest Adventure doesn't sound particularly suitable Subaru land no it's it's too far away anyway is it no maybe not no I'm gonna go a bit further north though yeah and then the other way do we have mountains can't see we've got a ferris wheel there oh are they mountains yeah I think they're mountains just through that one little window so is this it Fuji oh Highland Thomas land oh my God it's like Drayton Manor yeah this is a good theme park here so mini Mount Fuji Peak oh my God so they're making a big thing out of Mount Fuji that's not the mini one is it food Stadium it was the food Stadium great so we will be there weren't we we're looking South it's on our left yeah that's where we are and this is the takabisha is that what it's called let's find out yeah four yards this time 5 000 points we got a terrible score on the last round and did I actually declare what I didn't did I but I never would have got binocular Observatory so it doesn't really matter I said Observatory so I can be proud of that but I was never going to be correct yeah in that case then I should make my guess for the record before I make my guess geographically in case it gives it away so for this one it hasn't given it away luckily and I'm gonna say what I said before the mo the steepest inverted most severely inverted drop you know what I mean uh but that's a great perfect score and on this one it looks like we might be in Europe for a change plesso Di pharmacea it's a Spanish or Italian let's have a look pretty sure that's Italian yes Yen say fusika so this feels like Italy Northern Italy and in the po valley I would say because it's really flat the po valley being I don't know if that's the correct term the PO the poe planes somewhere near Milan maybe um not a Million Miles Away so what's this biggest Hospital di Pharmacy I've just considered oh we've got some snow there that's strange I've just considered again sorry I'm not thinking this through properly but in the last round it may not be just the physical structure of the roller coaster it might be that some nutcase went on that roller coaster a hundred times and broke a record could be that so but I've made my I've made my guess is it the only cycle path in Italy that's not really a world record roundest bush might be in the world no I think it's round it's good but it's I think I've seen better most hilarious car longest standing mound of snow been there since 1994. no I'm clutching at straws I think so in all seriousness it's probably the hospital plesso de Pharmacy what kind of Accolade could could a hospital have apart from being the biggest or most lives saved in a day yeah let's go for that and we'll try and find it and we'll say that we are pretty far north I think it's fair to say it could be Turin or Milan that's a big building over there as well I think we buy a quite a major river by the way because we've got that so I'm gonna yeah maybe it is Turin no it's too mountainous up there in Turin maybe we're at Pier Senza it's not necessarily the PO that that bridge spans of course but I think it's quite likely to be cremona looking we're looking East North East so we're on the south side of the river so piercenzo would match up but I can't find a huge university there there's a Burger King there so I'll go there this isn't right but uh as good a guess as any oh Palmer not too far away that's a good it's a good score four seven nine nine now let's have a look at this is that the bridge it doesn't matter this is the University degli studi de Parma Parco area could that be the biggest University campus no I don't think so because oh that is big actually carries on down here I just think there'll be a bigger one in America gotta be so I said I'd make my guess I did didn't I most lived saved but it's not it's not a hospital it's a university so I'm going to change I'm going to change my answer because it hasn't hasn't given it away flattest University that's ridiculous oh screw it I've got nothing better no I'll go biggest University campus I'm gonna be boring I'm gonna be boring biggest University campus in the world that's my guess it's pretty damn big and the final round on this game maybe I'll play this again let me know in the comments if you want to see it again and I think this might be an easy one in terms of the record maybe not the geography now let's try and get some perspective here how tall is that it's quite hard to tell it's obviously very big but if I could see some people up there is that a person there because if so that is like no no no no no no I want to see a person up there no I think they are people because that that's a barrier that's people and then that's some sort of speaker or something or a floodlight are you getting that are you are you are you appreciating that if again let me know in the comments once more if you think that's a person because if so then that is well over 100 meters tall I would say Jesus as incredible as that is I've got to move my mind is burning the question where is this I thought that built something like this in China but looking around I don't see too many Chinese people I see mainly Indian people not seeing a great number of Chinese people but oh and that's a big damn over there is it quite tropical again statue of unity where the hell is this I guess India if we're going on these people like yeah it could be Bangladesh or Sri Lanka but I very much doubt there'd be erecting something like that money even just because of money so this is India I just didn't think the tallest statue in the world was in India and he doesn't really the statue himself looks maybe it's a weird angle but that looks weird looks like Voldemort from this angle it's a bad angle sorry sir statue of unity it's in English if it was if we're in China it wouldn't be in in English would it you know over there as well it there'd be an English version Maybe so uh on this final round I'm definitely saying biggest statue in the world tallest statue in the world but where this is well I'm not expecting a particularly great score we're on a river we're in mountains ah I've got an idea statue of unity who are you who are we uniting perhaps the pakistanis and the Indians around areas such as Amritsar no that's too flat but maybe a bit further north we've got Rivers we've got mountains Punjab and Himachal Pradesh maybe just maybe we find our statue here this would be a great way to end this video on a high we've got a dam here so look at what what direction is the dam that's East from where we are I would put us over here uh I'll move on but I do have good a good feeling about this part of the world this part of the country I guess the question is how well is it going to show up on the map the further north we go I'm not so sure because you really are getting into the Himalayas there Jesus that goes up so far what the hell what country is this is that still Pakistan so many dotted lines God that's confusing how big of the mountain no hang on a minute we can't be that far north Tom look at the palm trees you tit about a bit further south now it's flat there because any mountains up there are going to be that don't think it's going to look like that not going to be that warm oh cat among the pigeons here what about if we head over to Bangla Bangladesh but that's not mountainous is it I'm a bit stuck can't be Bangladesh so I don't know ah balls to it I'm just gonna have to go in the middle of India a bit further south maybe they're uniting the round squigglers and uh straight liners my clan I'll go here then reluctantly because what do I just go up here I just don't think it's um I don't think it looks right climate wise but maybe up I'll click up here the score's gone um because it'll just because it'll be annoying if I'm wrong so I'll go here don't see the statue anywhere but biggest statue in the world and that's where I'll go yeah there we go further south in India um that's where it is I never would have found that there it is Statue of unity sorry about the lag that I've had today I think my internet's been playing up cheers virgin and looking at that yeah we do we do have two different languages we've got the flatliners again and these ones that's an interest I've never really given that one much thought but that's very different to anything else in India let me know in the comments and um yeah let me know as well if I've got anything cataclysmically wrong and offended a whole nation more importantly let me know if you enjoyed that and if you want to see that again um and if you did do like the video as well I enjoyed that that was a good old little Play Along video let me know how you got on eighteen five four two that's the score to beat well done if you beat that well done if you've got that Arizona one that is I still can't get over just how far south that was thanks for watching everyone uh and I'll see you all very soon it might be another geodetective that Graces your screens next but no we're not done yet because we need to check if I was right about my predictions I didn't I promised I didn't totally forget about that um for three hours so I have opened up all the Wikipedia pages for all five of those locations but I refrained from Reading anything so apart from the statue of unity the first thing it said was tallest statue in the world but we knew that so starting then with Angkor Wat the Guinness World Record considers it as the largest religious structure in the world originally constructed as a Hindu temple no way I just didn't know that Hinduism spread that far east I don't know anything about it very little so it wasn't Buddhist but it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple so in a way I was probably right that it was at some point the largest Buddhist temple in the world but as far as the Guinness World Record goes it's the largest religious structure because I guess technically it is one next one was Mount Graham International Observatory and we suspected based on what it said that it might have been the biggest binocular telescope okay not getting official confirmation that it's the biggest in the world but it must be or it must have been at the time that that map was made unless someone did throw a paper airplane for that I I don't know takabisha it's famous for having a drop angle of 121 angle the former steepest coaster in the world before being replaced by something in New Jersey so I was right University of Palma it's got 26 000 students huh doesn't say anything it could be the oldest no bologna is the oldest university then Oxford 3.5 million students in India I think just about takes that one Berry College in Georgia has the largest campus so I don't know no I'm not finding anything so I'm gonna have to rely on you to tell me what is so record-breaking about the University of Palma and if there isn't what happened there what happened at that exact spot that got into the Guinness World Records let me know finally statue of unity is the world's tallest statue 182 meters oh my God that is tall well there you have it um correct on a couple not so correct on a couple more let's do

are recording good stuff might as well get it out the way early doors uh how we doing everyone hope we're well uh welcome back to another geoguesser video I was meant to get a Geo detective video out for you today but it's proving pesky again uh but it will be a good one something a bit different but here we are I thought I'd give this country borders map a try which we tried three or four weeks ago and had great fun with um but we were playing the satellite view today we're going to play it as a normal game and you can play along the reason I'm not doing satellite view today is because I couldn't get that to work so simple as that really I did manage to achieve kind of a perfect score I was two points off the Perfect Score because of a bug but I imagine that today that ain't going to happen it's it's going to be much harder to get a a perfect score when we're just playing it on the ground um depending on where we are we might get lucky uh but without any further Ado I'm going to make this into a challenge so that you can play along and it's going to be no moving no time limit the best way to play on this sort of map so do follow the destructions down in the inscription below it's not too late to do that fine your loss and let's play I like the look of this one I like the look of this one to begin with this is the point at which two countries converge and we're on a path this is a proper Photosphere we've got tourists we can maybe try and gauge where these people are from I think I know him nah he looks like someone who used to work in the kitchen at at Toby carv well we've got to look at this writing for a for a start maybe this gives away the the name of the water fall would be good as long as I know it it looks like the Victoria Falls it can't be Niagara Falls obviously there is another one ah wait a minute I can't remember what they're called but it begins with I Isuzu it's not Isuzu that's a car brand I'll come back to that but looking down here here we also have some spanishyo language perigo perigo the waterfall that I'm thinking of oh man I used to have an atlas with the biggest waterfalls in and this is like one of the most famous is it on the border of Argentina and Paraguay something like that it's going to be tricky to find it that there'll definitely be some speed UPS in this video where I'm trying to find things but Isuzu Falls no that's the car make again igua IGA IGA it looks like igu uaso or something um is it on the edge of Venezuela or or am I just thinking of um the angel Force well if it is the let's call them the Isuzu Falls the ones that I'm thinking of that are very famous then it should come up on the map you know with little zooming but I think I'm looking in the right area here that's Paraguay there Iguazu surely this is what I'm thinking of the igua and that would correlate with the tropical Ness of the place The Iguazu Falls where is it where is it maybe it's not that I'm doubting myself now I will'll Follow The Iguazu River however we're into Brazil there that's that's not a border this is my worry and then it's into the piran river that's not good that is not good have I made this thing up ah Las karatas Del Iguazu surely it's here surely Iguazu Falls yes oh I was looking at that and it just didn't look like a waterfall where's the waterfall I don't know what they've done with this map I don't think that's quite right I mean we've got a path here that's heading down I don't see any water down there but right we got to figure this out now I am using the old the new rather Compass system which I'm I'm just going to have to get used to so that my face can be more in the corner so that's West we're looking West although the compass might not be correct I'm glad I found the um the Falls but I really want to get this spot on cuz the perfect score is on of course okay we can do this we can do this we're looking out to the west and we've got this a very distinct path shape with what looks to be an island in the middle which you can walk over to that looks like the island but there's no path leading into it unfortunately it's making me think that the compass is wrong because also the water the way that the water's flowing seems to be flowing South no it's flowing North it's flowing North so that's correct yeah ah does that lead to that I don't think that does lead to that um Island actually when you zoom in it's nowhere near it I would say so that is that got it's got to be it's got to be which would put us kind of here so we've got this path coming down it's not really the right shape it should be more Jagged and angular than that but I would say that that's that's got to be it isn't it am I missing something no cuz we're looking to the east there Tom nothing's really adding up here to be honest I would actually put us there but there's no there's no path but looking at the shape of things I think that's where I'd put us so it's not going to be right but you know I doubt we're going to get a perfect score on here anyway but that's the best I've got that is the best I've got unfortunately and that is where my guess will be damn that is quite frustrating I didn't think that the the land protruded out that far either and that was actually just the other side that wasn't an island looked like an island because of all of this interesting interesting it was quite tough to figure things out in that one but one point off as annoying as that is I can't Grumble with did you get perfect there did you use your Noggin a bit more right this looks pretty Baltic uh or sorry I meant to say Scandinavian but it looks Baltic in terms of how cold it is um interesting well what could this be then it looks like this is the Border here this this cutway into the trees is the Border I've got something in mind here for this we've got a signpost saying welcome to whatever country we're coming into and then you can clearly see this is the Border it's making me want to do a border mission you know to travel a country's border from from start to finish anyway let's not get carried away let's take a look at Scandinavia and think about which two countries this could be where they feel the need to have this cutout there's no fence but much like with USA and Canada there doesn't need to be a fence it could just be surveillance you know and Laser white you know what you call them motion senses that's what they have isn't it so it could be Sweden and Norway somewhere up here but what I was thinking it could be is Finland and Russia because I don't think they have offense but I think they have the odd Watchtower the odd sort of manned you know Outpost with the odd Soldier even more so in 2023 I imagine but yeah I'm just wondering if this could be Russia Finland although we are on a road so presume ably there would be a checkpoint here if it were that so I'm leaning back towards Norway Sweden the reason I'm not considering um Finland Sweden is because it's all a river until you get very very far north at which point it wouldn't look like this look it's still going the river this River oh all the way up so yeah no argument there so I think we're looking at this well first of all we've got to see how far south this looks judging by the trees I don't think it's too far north maybe this kind of area maybe around here somewhere yeah let's try and find a road around here it's not going to be the e14 let's have a look at the compass as well that's North yeah that's North so that does Bend round does Bend round and then that one bends to the left but we've got a river there as well I don't think it the river apparently stops at the border that's slightly odd I don't think it's that one it can't be that one I think we can deduce this and I think we're also getting too far north here are we No Maybe not maybe not it's not that one ah how about that do we think there's a lake that way I'm going to just look for a few minutes to see if I can find a better one guys uh bear with [Music] me okay I've gone far north enough now I'm actually at the point but which I started my straight line mission that is right there pretty much and West is the gigantic stor rers vat net where I nearly sank marius's kayak okay I'm I'm going to go back down try South no but I do think we're further south rather than North H that could bit you know border slightly at that angle Road slightly South this one bit of a Bend yeah I think that's it I'm not sure but it's got the right Bend I'm going for that bang get in that feels good because I thought I'd gone too far south there look how far south it is when we started to get up towards Mo irana I knew that was way too far north because I've been up there and it's it's it looks completely different as as many of you saw that height of pine is something you get much further south so I knew we couldn't have been up there but I have to admit when I got past these areas I thought oh no we're getting near the sea now this is too far south maybe it is Russia Finland so that felt great to get that one did you also get it do let me know in the comments and we move on to the third round and this looks getable I don't want to jinx it but you know it looks like Europe so we've got every chance here come on give me some language give me some language or a flag either would be fine okay we got we got Pine here a similar kind of pine a bit different perhaps oh okay okay I wasn't expecting that oh now is that the Slovakian one or the Slovenian one it's the crest from one of those country's Flags I think it's Slovakia isn't it ah we'll see we'll see so not sure I'm going to get much else here and I'm already looking at the bend of the roads to see if I'm going to be able to scour the map for this place cuz I'm not sure I'm going to get much more info I think we're looking at Slovakia Poland it's fairly odd for it to have snow but it makes sense that the Border would be high altitude at the top of a mountain range you know or just high up yeah I don't know if I'm going to find this because Slovakia has a lot of miles of borders it could even be going into Hungary wait a minute which way is North that's North so it's like we've headed into Slovakia this way coming from Hungary Could That Be Right North is there we're going to be helped by this little road here and the shape of the houses and things I think this is getable we've got to try and read this haven't we I don't think any of those words are countries to be honest just because the Slovakian building is North I'm going to search this border the Slovakian Hungarian border and just see if I can find a spot that lines up wish me luck  and that's all the river danbe then for the rest of it so the best one I found was the first one that I zoomed into this is the one that most adds up that would be the building this would be that little road even though it's blocked off but I'm not mad on it the other option is is that that is on the Slovakian side and we're at the North by Poland so I'll have a quick look for something up [Music] here and that's all flat uh yeah that's the best thing I've got to be honest I'm not totally happy with it not happy but it's going to have to do I think this is an opportunity for you guys some of you to really catch up here let's give it a go an area I just looked over what I've got that all wrong in my head I got the angles of things all wrong I'm blaming the new Compass system I thought it was more like that not happy with myself for that I've got to admit penultimate round this looks interesting we've left Europe and we're into Asia and this script what is that script is is that um La Thailand let's find out we're driving on what are we driving on I think we're driving on the left aren't we you can see that motor bike's got his light on yeah I think this might be La look at this big golden Turtle there's a joke there somewhere but I must refrain from embarrassing myself and yeah the border is a river we've got the Thailand flag doesn't look like there's a massive connection over there there's no bridge and it doesn't look like there's a much of a boat that goes across it's very mountainous let's say that we're on the Thailand side and let's not overthink it because that would make sense and the flag does look very tie it's just similar to the LA one isn't it I think anyway Compass don't fail me again that's North so actually this could be over towards Myanmar or Burma it looks quite mountainous but there's a river quite a quite a meaty River I don't suppose we're going to see which way that's flowing is there any way to tell that no maybe not but if that's North then I do think we're on the west the west side of Thailand that would make sense wouldn't it we could be somewhere like this yeah we could be somewhere like this look although that's the meong so we're not there but you get my point there could be a section of the Border um which faces West but I can't see any others to be fair it's diagonal it's running Northeast so that would be perfect if the if the meong wasn't there but ah look at this we also have this little river and that would be flowing that way wish I could tell which way the river was flowing just just looking for some Clues on the other side can't see much but yeah I think this this is a good little spot the Hang River need little village on the other side the other side being La maybe there maybe there it why not that's the perfect angle I mean we can have a look at the shape of this Road it's very long and straight actually and running Southeast no that's running more East I'll have another little [Music] look nothing better so far so that's where I'm provisionally going just going to have a quick Gander elsewhere just very quickly skim we can see where there's no River and no civilization could be down here so I'll have a quick look down [Music] here and that's the end it's all mountains so yeah that is the best spot I've found in all of Thailand it's not right though that's the only problem but I'm going to go there anyway bugger why oh why did I miss that what is wrong with you Tom I thought it was all mountains but how did I not notice that River at the end I definitely would have gone there as well for freak's sake well I've really given the game away here what can I say I've really let you have it um I'm sorry I'm sorry for this disappointing performance last round though can I redeem myself oh my goodness huh well already I think I have an idea here we'll be heading into the Republic of Ireland from the north of Ireland moving from miles an hour to kilometers an hour um there's a British number plate but there's an Irish one so a mixture sign poost for Dublin and welcome to Northern irand there's no excuses now is there I've got to redeem it shouldn't be hard this one I think we can probably go right in and say that pretty safely that it's that it's this one oh no I'm not going to be that Hasty but I do actually think it's here south dual Carriage Way bending round to the east yeah I think this is our location got a mountain to the West which we have yeah the Ring of gullian no I think that's it I think that's it so good we finish things off with an almost underwhelmingly easy round um but on the on the bright side my score isn't quite so embarrassing 22444 let me know if you did better than that if you did worse than that don't be ashamed that's fine um I just thought that was quite poor for me considering that I could have got I could have got all of those rounds but not to worry because when we play this again in a couple of weeks time I'll be gunning for a perfect score and I will be not surrendering until that happens I've given myself a platform to build on so uh all is not lost this was just a warm-up game hope you enjoyed watching me negotiate those borders let me know if you enjoyed let me know how you did I do enjoy reading where you messed up and where you excelled in the comments even if I don't have time to reply to the comments yeah we'll do this again I've got to do this again I think a perfect score on this map would be a real achievement because I think those rounds we're actually quite favorable see you next time everyone take care ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -25.68433986833699, "lng":

has got to be worth a go this has got to be a great map to play biggest lake of every country and US state I've never done anything like this so 157 locations so it's not every country in the world because I guess yeah some of them don't have the photop sphere on their biggest lake some countries don't even have a lake the Maldives Springs to mind so they've bolstered it up with us States hopefully we don't get too many US Estates and it's a nice spread but yeah I think this will be a really good challenge a very hard one actually potentially because we might just be on a boat let's make that challenge link no moving of course um and please play along if you haven't already or even if you have already you could easily beat me here that this is going to be more to do with luck than skill I think but hopefully there will be some good chances for detective work let's go we have music listen to that can you hear that might as well check if we're recording while we're at it yes we are yeah that should be quite nice and quiet for you that's hilarious that's actually really tasteful music Well Done geoguesser Right Here we are on our first Lake anyway and it's huge um it's quite Brown that is actually distracting me quite a lot we've got islands and as predicted we're on a boat um this guy is quite angrily filming it or taking photos M if you if your heart's not in it mate don't do it and yes as you often do with these photos spheres they're taken by a person and you get their name Hector Navaro and that can give us a clue fortunately in some ways that can give us a clue to where we are not always though cuz they could travel now the other glaring clue we have here is a flag green yellow and red H I'm a bit Rusty now with my Flags but Bolivia okay let's let's keep a look at the it doesn't really look like Bolivia it's oh no no Bolivia does have jungle I'll get into the map in a sec let's just look at all these Clues because you can see the flag behind this guy's head but he doesn't really look Bolivian there aren't that many black people in Bolivia Colombia yes Ecuador yes and then this dude is much darker than these guys as well so maybe we're not in South America it's going to come down to the flag the flag is going to be very helpful here I think I just hope if I can get the flag okay which way is North that way is North so we've got an island there we've got an island there to the Northwest but really we can't see a lot else that seems to go on into Oblivion over there that's kind of to the east so let's get into the map then because I just want to check Bolivia the biggest lake in Bolivia ah it depends if they are counting lakes that that straddle two countries like would that be the biggest lake for Peru and Bolivia or would they judge it on whichever area of water is predominantly in the one country either way guys I think that these are quite deserty areas and not this kind of jungly stuff that we've got going all around around the lakes here the lake you can tell it's trees I don't think that that's what you have there I think it's quite arid there is jungle in Bolivia but it's uh yeah it's not where the big lakes are right Excuse me while I try and remember the flags here so Venezuela no that's got blue in it Columbia's got blue in it and Ecuador's got blue in it it's none of the others it could be some of these Surinam that's a big lake that is a big lake okay that would make sense because they're you know they have a South American name but I just want to look at Africa because there's so many flags that that could be Ghana it can't be because it's um vertical instead of horizontal which we have senagal see because I haven't done any flag tests in a while I'm getting confused between Sagal which it can't be by the way there's one Lake one big lake in Sagal and it's in the desert Cameroon it could be this one got an island there what other man I need to think about Flags bear with me yeah Ethiopia Ethiopia Lake Tanner looks quite looks quite jungly there that's all kind of jungle isn't it kind of like Tanner let's have Let's Line these islands up this is hard we're judging it as I kind of predicted a lot of the clues are on the boat San San sellan I wonder if there's a town called San that would be good wouldn't it B here ooh nah that's North that's North the reason I'm focusing on Ethiopia is is pretty much purely because of the the facial structure of this guy and the fact that we seem to have this weird language you know this weird it's a very unique you know script can't really see it that well but also the flag obviously does have a star in the in the middle of it doesn't it or something but we can't see that he could be Ethiopian as well just don't know if you How likely are you to get two Latin Americans on holiday in Ethiopia I'm just going to check back in this Surinam one San San Browns it's like Dutch isn't it there's plenty of ISS here but I don't know about the flag of Surinam I think it's a bit different let me let me size sorry I'm taking ages on this this might be quite a difficult video right that's North I don't like the way that all the lands in the background are the position like that that Oblivion over there where's that is it down here doesn't really add up maybe the compass is wrong yeah maybe the compass is wrong okay let's imagine the compass is wrong [Music] so where's Oblivion oblivion's over there that's Oblivion so we'd be like there that's the bigger island of the two and that's the other Island yeah that makes that makes a lot more sense very often the compass is wrong on these photos spheres oh what's that yeah that's a building and right in line if we were to look this way you've got bah da which is quite a Big Town to in Ethiopia not the capital but a bloody Big Town on this lake so I'm pretty confident with this now I'm pretty confident this is right yeah it's that Oblivion up there that and then that that there is that anyway I've spent so much time on this now I'm pretty happy this will be a great one for detective work if this is right yes 4999 brilliant could have done with that extra point we might really need that extra point cheers Hector what don't you cheer up a bit next time and concentrate more on the the positioning yeah prick right next round now thanks Hector okay what have we got here Hector might have taken the only photo so we we've got to uh got to applaud him for that oh my goodness me I thought we had a satellite like imagery then we don't it's from a drone I think but look how high up that was taken from goodness and what's good about that is we can see the shape of this Lake perfectly it's a big lake it's not like gigantic it's not as big as the last one but it's mighty big it's a reservoir because you can see the dam there but also you can always tell a reservoir because you get these these shapes the layers where the water has been rising and falling so let's get to work at trying to figure out what country this might be it's pretty arid it could be this could be Spain Mexico let's have a look right not sure what that is I'm trying to figure out what side of the road they're driving on but it's so far down ah you know you can see from these Road markings they're driving on the right which which actually hardly narrows it down at all I'd be surprised if it was left if it was left that would mean it's Australia wouldn't it um so Mexico don't know do not know those Road markings could they be they couldn't really be European could they with that yellow in the middle am I right and it was taken by DJ veg which really I like that because it doesn't give anything away got some boats there lots of vehicles mainly Camper vans a few boats um but yeah I think I'm ready to have a little search on the map now to be honest it's not going to be America is it I mean oh but it's every US state I'm sorry I'm sure you forgive me but I I forgot I forgot that it's every US state this could well be a us US state it is a one in three chance that we'll get a US state we've also got some pretty good some pretty impressive like infrastructure here as well right so I think we yeah I think we're looking at like Nevada New Mexico Arizona wow this could this could take a little while like me we have here I'll get it but it'll take a bit of searching I think the one thing we've got going for us the main thing is the dam on the south so that's North so it's kind of like a a y shape or a v a V shape with the dam at the bottom so let's bear that in mind as we search Hoover Dam wow Hoover Dam well hang on a minute how far does that go no I don't think we're looking at that no we're not looking at Hoover Dam California no no I'm not going to search there for now Colorado what about this one here the naaj dam don't think that's right either remember the compass could be wrong Compass could be wrong that's quite a distinctive that that arm but then it raises the question what was the water level that that could be an island on an ordinary summer's day so bear it in mind I don't think it's that Lake though where are we now Colorado yeah where's the where's the biggest one in Colorado is it that one I wonder if things can get skewed by the you know the lens of this thing I don't think we're there really this this looks like New Mexico Arizona sort of Direction that's got to be it that's got to be it you could tell it a mile off it's actually not so much of a v that is the lens thing that I'm talking about uh skewing that it's actually quite straight from that side to that side but this is definitely it you can see every little feature you can see that bit there jutting out not an island you can see that bit of Lake there which is there so interestingly that's the biggest lake in Arizona so it's not counting that one then which is clearly bigger it's obviously it's given that to Nevada I presume anyway it's the Theodore Roosevelt Lake and Dam let's just try and make sure we don't lose any more points we can always give ourselves a moral perfect score so got to just put ourselves in the middle of the screen here so about there and it's a full score on round two 8 7 yards I think many of you would have got that one if you didn't get the first one but yeah well done if you found that one that was a bit easier that Lake might service Phoenix I would say it probably does the Gila River interesting round three I'm enjoying this this is everything I thought it would be and more actually because we've had a mixture we've we've had a boat one we've had an aerial one and now we're on a beach with some sort of M Pole got a dude there walking along we've got flags it's pretty poor image quality oh look at the guy who made this one I I won't try and pronounce that sh I think he's fairly accurate so that would indicate China or you know Mongolia maybe no Mongolia they don't have they don't have the Chinese symbols do they so maybe this is is China I mean look how big this lake is I don't know anything about lakes in China but this lake is absolutely gigantic because well it's it's very very big it's very big you can't see the other side pretty much any given point you can see this enormous arm of Coastline wrapping around here so it's not exactly a hazy day but either way you can see that this is a gigantic Lake the guy or girl who was or in between who has taken this may have traveled just as they did in the first round this guy over here looks dark skinned but it could be the poor image quality this woman as well yeah it could just be that cuz look how black the the walkway looks that's very dark for some reason so it could be that the light is Playing Tricks on us or it could be that we're actually just in Africa let's have a look at China that looks like a huge Lake but again I'm not I'm still not sure whether they would count that as China's biggest lake you've got that one but we won't be there CU that's that's a very builtup area I think that one's pretty damn big bloody hell and that one there's quite a lot of similarly sized lakes here but I actually think that is not only the biggest king high but it's also it would match up for me with this sort of uh terrain kind of looks like more towards Mongolia that sort of thing I mean there is a big lake in Mongolia here OES like there's a lot of options here here this isn't going to be easy right okay let's presume that this is the King High Lake and let's presume that the compass is correct that's North the sun is in the South so that would that would add up so would we be here Bird Island Warf ticket office because then this Inlet here would be that and then the mountains you can see in the background but that might be I don't know about that that looks too small to be that gap for me although it is hard to tell how big this lake is exactly so that's one Theory we could be here something something Scenic area that would that make sense because this does look like like a bit of a spit of land that makes more sense to me cuz you've got the spit of land you've got absolutely vast expanses of water all the way around oh are they mountains over there well that's all right that's feasible and then you've got less of a gap look less of a gap but you still got Mountain so I'm I like that I like that I might I might just go for that and just be done with it to be honest it's annoying about that perfect score isn't it Hector you got this one but I don't think that adds up youve got like Lake by Cal the thing is you culturally you've got this I don't think you'd have that in Russia or less likely ah but then you've got the the dark skin now I'm going to go for it I'm going to go for where I've clicked and go for China because also if you have a look here the the mountains get bigger as they as they go further further down that Coast Eastward and I think they do here I think they do there so if this is Africa I'm sorry but I'm I'm I'm 80% sure 85% sure about this let's do it oh yes come on and uh again I mean I this is this is still a moral Victory I think still should be on for a perfect score here but there you go an even harder map than we thought to get a perfect score on so wow lock KN I was going to say this looks more European um Lo KN I've heard of this this is um a huge Lake actually probably the biggest lake in the British Isles and it's in Northern irand the smallest principality or country in the British Isles pretty sure it's bigger than Loch Ness there's Loch Ness and there's Loch KN it's huge um and because it's so big it might be a bit tricky for me to actually pinpoint where we are here the compass needs to be right for sure let's try and Trust the compass might even birds of L KN and LU B no we're not going to be able to read any more on there so Compass where are we we're there so I mean I think a perfect score here is highly unlikely to be honest we seem to have a bit of an abyss over there but then we've got this strip the the edge of the spit is directly east so do we do we have anything we could be here ok Conor's stronghold don't see an island oh is that the island could be could be but there should be another little tiny Island as well not seeing that or could we be sort of here could we be there and we're looking out no it's not directly east then is it we can't be on the island that's a bit silly so I'm starting to wonder if the compass is wrong um so in which case we need to consider other options well do can we get can we get the sun where's the Sun ah we can get the sun look at that that's South that would back that would back it up guys that would back it up beautifully so I do think we've got to go down here then I'm going to go here okon stronghold on derua Island let's go for it oh my goodness ah that makes that makes a bit of sense I don't know exactly what we were looking at there there's so many little bits and Bobs we got that that that I don't think we were looking at Far East but there we were we've dropped 13 points but we've still got a mighty old score I dropped by far the most points on by far the easiest Lake to locate but here we are on the final round and we're on a road once more we've had a mixture now this is going to be a US state again and there's the US flag just in the background of these two Keen fishermen uh that helps us well it doesn't really help us we can't be in Canada can we um because their Lakes are gigantic this looks to me quite East Coast quite New England or maybe a bit further south it's going to it's going to have to be a case of looking at the map and finding something shapewise that fits we're lucky here to have this road that cuts through because I imagine there's a bridge further on or maybe this is a dead end maybe it just Services you know these these marinas and boat houses and properties but this feature will will help us and the compass is going to work so that's North so we're looking up on this Eastern part what I thought was the eastern part is North and then that's South so I've got a bit of a map of it in my head let's just go into a state that we think is likely what about Pennsylvania Pennsylvania what's hard is to to actually hang on a minute don't tell tell me I found it no no I was going to no no no no I haven't I haven't I was going to say though what's what's going to be hard is finding the biggest lake in each one because as you saw in China it can be quite hard to actually decide which one's biggest and that's not even taking into account the ones that straddle two states like New York for example oh number plate not yellow so that rolles out New York not entirely but but yeah it it does Massachusetts there's a big lake that's obviously the biggest lake in Massachusetts Quabbin Reservoir fishing area that doesn't look to me like our Lake Vermont I presume it would be this absolutely gigantic Lake I think it would be more Piney up there I really really do I don't think we're up there Maine I'm going to leave alone for now New Jersey would have slightly yellow plates so I'll leave that for now Maryland I like the sound of Maryland because it's a little bit further south here's a lake that's North remember I don't think that quite adds up Delaware it's got hardly any lakes in it that's to see right we're going to have to speed things up in a bit because I'm struggling to find this lake or even the correct state for that matter what about Virginia that's the biggest one in Virginia I don't know about that are we further south than I thought here are we just yeah are we just you know you know North [Music] Carolina that's got to be it if this ain't it no this has got to be it I've been searching for ages guys um in probably at least 10 or 12 States I've arrived at this one Lake North man which me and Greg actually drove past funnily enough on our way uh to yeah down to Columbia but anyway big lake in North Carolina so a bit further south than I initially thought but I I will admit I've been searching also in Alabama and Georgia and South Carolina but for a while I was searching for this sort of thing but they're mostly Bridges they're going to have a gap for a boat and then then I started thinking well maybe this is like a spit you know that is a dead end basically and and that's I think well let's just make sure yeah you got this little creek Here There and we've got the space to the north and to the South I'm I've searched that much that I'm almost certain that this is correct so yeah good I knew it had to be cuz genuinely searched every square inch of every Lake um even with the spit thing in mind and I came back to Lake Norman and there it is let's view the results we can be pleased with that we can be pleased with that can't we jinny Weasley I didn't make that uh 24985 oh that that last B was exhausting but I didn't want to give up I didn't want to just cop out there $ 4999 5,000 499 99 I mean they were they were I think they were perfect scores which is annoying because if they if they had have been more accurate on the map I would have um persevered with luck KNE maybe I'd have still got that wrong but uh that was a good game and there's room for improvement for me um a perfect score is still possible but uh as always let me know how you did in the comments um did you get a perfect score be honest um and did you get that last one because I think that was the hardest one uh to actually find the lake and and the right the right spit there so do let me know and let me know if you have any great map ideas in the comments what most of you want to see is uh the geod detective and that is coming I am pining away on that one but um yeah hope you enjoyed what I had for you today and I'll see you for the next one guys thanks as always for watching take care but ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 11.6516417, "lng":
