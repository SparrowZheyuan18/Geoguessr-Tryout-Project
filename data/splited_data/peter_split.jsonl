Nordic houses that youwould see in um Norway Greenlandanything else so the road lines appearto be all whitethink it's really hard to see thequality is not good that I think theyare all white we're driving on the rightside I feel like this might be reallytricky to align so we are looking forum somewhere up here maybe because itlooks like we have a big land to ourkind of waste wait where's the compasslike this I guess the compass Directiondepends on that location how it would bealigned but from above yeah it shouldalways be North to to the northum so yeah anyways uh because of thisland to our West I'm thinking maybesomewhere this area I don't know if thatwould align so and if there are anytowns that would work somewhere heremaybe oh I think we got it I think wegot it I was looking for this thingyum this was kind of a unique shape and Ithink we have it here sadeloand we do have a bigger island to ourWest we have a no oh is it there's justnukeit's just Luke it felt smaller than itthan this I thought nude unook wasbigger uh but okay it's just just nukeapparently okay I was just complicatingthings apparently okay this is nukeInternational Airport and we are lookingfor this building right here the mainone I imagine very nice very niceanother perfect scoreI feel like the locations we've beengetting are not the most difficult onesbut I I enjoy thema very muchokay now we have River like I was whenstarting this map uh playing this map Iwas expecting to maybe have more landbordersbecause thus far we've been getting alot of like ports and airports whichare easier but not exactly what Iexpected to be honestum but yeah anyway so let's let's keepplaying it though because I'm enjoyingthis uh yeah this is a very big city Idon't have any good guesses from off thebat so let's zoom in see which sidewe're driving on and all all that goodstuffthese are some really what is that isthat like what we have a parking lot inthe middle what are those what are thoseI'm so confused at first I was thinkingthat's a stadium huge one but no itmakes no sense no okay we have smallerstadiums that don't really help we aredriving on thoughon which side is it left sideit looks like it is left side yeah yeahwe are driving on the left side I'mthinking Japan maybe I'm getting kind ofJapanese Vibes possibly but yeah I feelthe rules could fit maybe Japan I feelit's always difficult to tell from aboveto me at least because I'm not used toseeing all the rules and everything fromabove but I feel like they could fitthey're not super uniform but but by thecolors and everything I could imaginethem being in Japan I thinkwe have a stadium here with no texts nowritings we have an American footballfield or somethingmaybe just maybe just like a regularStadium it feels like quite a lot ofgreenery we have a large batches ofgreen lots of forestswhich is always nice to seelots of parks as well smaller onesso that's nice that's nice so is thisJapan is this Japan so we have a prettybig airport here again is that wherewe're trying to pinpoint or what is thishow is this a border I'm confused I isthis is this a portum okay well let's try to align thiswith Japan we have a smaller Islandshere very small onesand this might be a good clue like thisside of this bigger island to the eastso let's see does anything in Japan aline does this fit it's not exactly thesame shapeand we do have a river but that Riverthat's it a line I'm confused it'ssimilar but I don't think so yeah no nono nobut the whole layout and everything wasquite similar so so I thought it mightbe itI don't see anything that works donethen I don't thinkumI'll look again okay we are kind ofrunning out of time and I have not founduh what we're looking forso that's not greatis this Japan what else could it be ifit's not Japanmaybe I'm just just terrible at aligningthings I'm trying the left side likeMalaysia Indonesia the Shadows did go tothe north right wait the Shadows aregoing to the Southoh my God what a big Overlook By Me isThis South Africa or Australia orAustralia I think I feel this might beAustralia then because the city lookslike I feel like it aligns better withwater to the north west is this likeBrisbane or somethingor just Sydney okay it is Brisbane oh myGod okayI thought I did did check the sunDirection but I guess it was theprevious roundoh mixed up my rounds okay okay okayokayoh if I'm glad I figured this one out ina timely manner because I would havebeen not happywouldn't be happy if I if I didn'trecognize this one what is this speechReserve oh how is that a border I'mconfused with some of these locations inthis map so we have this circle here isit this that Circle or oh it's this herethen it's that this circleso we arehere okay nice okay"}

falls with such a huge citynot that much of a bigger of an airportmy first thoughts are maybe india herebut let's let's investigate a little seeum what kind of clues can we gatherthe house roofs are kind of kind of blueand gray which which side are we drivingon can we tellit does look like we're doing the leftside here so i think india is a reallygood shoutwith such a huge city i don't know ifthis could be new delhii remember i had new delhi in the famousplace video but i think new delhi lookeda bit differentbut maybe we were just looking at adifferent part of new delhi that's alsopossible so what we have is like a bigbig road that goes kind of around aroundthe city so we maybe can use that for umidentification purposesso let's uh have a look at new daily atfirst we have a road we do have a bigroad that goes around does that alignthoughnot really i wanted it to align but itdoesn'tno i i don't think this is new daily umwhat else could it belet's check some other big indian citiesmaybe let's let's not throw away the theindia guests just yetwe have a lot of greenery here couldthis be pakistanthe bigger cities don't fit at leastcould it actually be new delhi that ikind of kind of overlooked maybe maybelike a smaller part of new delhi wedon't see that river though we don't seethat river that goes through delhi andnew delhiindia has so many cities it's crazycould we could be literally anywhereand it's not jaipur either right it justdoesn't align in jaipur has somemountains as wellwait we do have some mountainsthese are kind of hilly hillyjaipur international airportlet's have a lookwait is it is it actually iti didn't think it alignswe do have a roundaboutyo i it's actually jaipur i didn't thinkit aligns why did i not think it alignsbecause i did look at jaipur earlier buti didn't see this this road going allaround the city how did i miss itit is there how did i miss it the weirdthing is i looked at itearlierbut okay let's move on so here is theairportthis is oh like bunch of bunch of likeangers for planesthe airportdoesn't seem too bigthis feels like europe i would saylooking at the houses and then theshadows going to the north so we shouldbe in the northern hemisphere driving inthe right side as wellso that that confirms it could be europewhat a mountainous area and quite a dryone as wellit seemslooking this dry i was thinkingi think the most sense makesturkey i think because looking this dryyet still looking quite european becausein other european countries i justcan't see them looking this dry like youcan get some some dry places in likeitaly but but i don't think they looklike this from above so so my main guesswould be something like turkey or couldit be israel possibly or not jordan itwouldn't be jordan so i'm thinkingsomewhere in that areadoesn't look like a too huge of a cityokay let's let's start looking in turkeymaybe so what we're looking for islike a citywith a with a small river going to theside and an airport of courseand some hills around so it wouldn't beit wouldn't be up here up here it's verygreen mountains so i would say it'ssomewhere probably kind of kind ofmore in a good central eastern areasomewhere thereso let's let's have a look somewherearound there if we can find somethingi think cogna looks kind of similar butwe don't have a river going throughokay ii think it's batmani think it's batman batman is like ajoke in geogaser umcommunity everyone knows about batman ithink it actually is batman this timebecause we have a riverthe city shape kind of fits and we havean airport batman is always bigger thani anticipatewhat i noticed that a couple of turkishcities have similar shapesgot a bunch of them were looking kind oflike this i wonder if there's anyparticular reason for that yeah we havethis roadwe should be right here i thinkniceround number four where is the airportoh we have a big river that could behelpfulthe quality is not the bestunfortunatelythe airport is not very big either onlyone runway where do the shadows go theshadows go to the north okay so we're inthe northern hemisphere pretty big riverto our north which side are we drivingonit looks like we're driving the leftside here huh well initially i wasthinking africaso driving on the left side and being inthe northern hemisphere kenya uganda i'mnot sure do they have such a big rivergoing through let's check it quicklykampalanot reallynairobinot reallymaybe coastal mombasaombasait does have big waters but not likethismaybe bangladeshcould this ever be bangladeshor india againthis is a really really really big riverhere maybe malaysia could just bemalaysia to have a river going throughhere that i mean the direct directionwould be similar it's the closest thati've found yet but but no nomaybe it is still bangladesh but butelsewhere not dhaka because the thisriver does kind of feel similar withthese small small pathwaysso maybe it is bangladesh just just notdarker cause dhaka didn't align wellthis be itwait could it be ityo it kinda looks like it isno you have this thing and then bunch ofsmaller like like thingslike islands i think it is wait is itit's indie it is india wow okay so itwas indie oh interesting i think iremember watching some some videos aboutthis river but china wants to build somedams likea higher in the river and then it mightkind of overflow india and bangladeshgetting off topic again we have anairport so here so we're kind of here inthe parking lot basically i think nicenice 14 meters let's go and the lastround oh is that water i like water andsatellite view it is water so we arecoastallet's go let's goso if it's coastal in a huge city likethis it shouldn't be too difficult tofind ihopei hope very big city let's look at theairport big airport as well bunch ofrunaways all over the place any texts atall that could help me not that i canseethis is probably not the best place fora hotelit's so close to such a big airport ifyou visit this place that's probably notthe hotel for you which way does the sungo which side we are driving on we'redoing the right side the shadows aregoing a little bit to the north it seemsbut not much maybe northern brazil thereare some bigger cities there but withthe roofs fits we have a lot of verylike white roofs would this be somethinglike whoop grease maybe where did themap golike like like uh crete maybe heraklionor somethingbecause i know greece has a lot of whiteroofsuh well heracleon doesn't align so it'snot gonna beherebut maybe it's still a different city inthis areacyprus it's not gonna be cyprus i feellike this map hascoverage from countries with officialcoveragefrom what i've seen thus farnow the coast doesn't align i didn'tknow that this map has only officialcoverage countries because when playingsatellite view i kind of like to play umthat it could be anywhere and i canexpand the geogra even more but stillthis is a good fun in my opinion turkeycould this maybe be a northern turkeythis is not gonna be istanbul though nono and the other northern cities arevery hilly andnot as bigi genuinely don't know with these whiteroofs i was thinking greece but doesn'talign nothing in the area really alignswe have a baseball field somaybe somewhere in americas i wasthinking mexico but the mexico i don'tknow the roofs don't feel american butbut with a baseball field on driving onthe right side maybe another supposedbaseball field here so maybe u.s orsouthern u.s or mexico another baseballfield so many baseball fields it has tobe america's somewhere but with withcoast waitcould this be puerto rico puerto ricomakes sense with with water to the northi think puerto rico had some some kindof kind of like bathe like this i thinkpuerto rico makes sense i didn't knowpuerto rico's white roofs it is yeah itis it is it is we have this bridge heretoo we are righthere nice one nice and another perfect"}

stadium maybe withuh like aa roof that can be closed what okaywhich side are we the the Shadows aregoing to the north so we are in thenorthern hemisphere which had alreadydriving on is the question here okay itlooks like we are driving on the rightside rubbing in the right side nodriving on the left side never mind thisthis thisHighway made me think of the right sidebut no the the street lineswould indicate left side driving hereuh so would this be like Japan thenwe do have mountains here Japan is quitemountainousuh lots of coastso I think Japan might be a good Shoutwith such a big city we have like anairport here as well we have a some sortof a stadium any writing maybe don't seeany writing at all unfortunately whatwhat what I am thinking Japan maybelet's see if we can align something whatcould it bewith water like thatSapporo no it was doesn't work okay itis Fukuoka okay okay it is Fukuokanow the islands are lie and everythingaligns very good a very big city Ididn't realize work was so so bigI wonder what's the population so ourlocation we're looking for is right hereon the kind of western part of the cityum how do we align this we have thehighway going here so this highway Ithink we havea riveris it this River here or we have therailroad there okay here is that Riverhere is the baseball field right hereand we are on this road somewhere likearound here we have the house we areright like heregreat round okay okay okay we got aforest and something mountainous it feltlike oh this looks so cool from aboveall these forests and you can see howhow hilly they arethat's really coolbut that doesn't help us much withfiguring out where we are though so ohwow there is like a big big volcano herelike mountainprobably a dormant volcano maybe oh butwe don't get is that a it's a small CityI mean it's better than nothing what arethese colors is that a camera glitch oror are peoplecelebrating something colorful therewhat is thatI don't think it's a camera glitch Ithink it's like some some colorful tentsor something really looks really weirdfrom above I wonder what's happeningthere if you know let me know in thecomments what looks very interestingthat's for sure uh the Shadows are goingsouth yeah Shadows are going south whichwould indicate southern hemisphereum are we driving on the left side againor noit looks like we might be driving on theleft side which is the one I want tomake sure I want to make sure becauseI'm thinking this might be Indonesiathat's that's my thinkingI just wanna I wanna figure out whichside we're driving onfirst yeah it's really hard to tell butit looks like this car would be drivingon the left side and and the house islook like they might be Indonesianand uhanother reason why I think Indonesiawould fit is that it does have a lot ofvolcanoes uh Indonesia depending on howyou count them Indonesia is arguably hasthe most active volcanoesum in the worldso yeah that's that's something to toknowum I'm guessing this is probably a lakeor maybe it's it's like um I don't knowhow you call those in English uh obey Iguessuh maybe but but but butthis be Java let's see if we can maybefind like a a big lake like this maybeor or a a baylike thatmaybe somewhere here noOh I thought of me I might have it butno that's not it the shape is differentunfortunately another thing is that it'shard to like figure out how large thelake would be on the map it feels likeit should be large but how large is thisbig enough or is it too large or toosmall but something I always strugglewith in go ohI think it is it I think it is it Ithink the shape matches perfectly Lake[Music]sink karak and we do have a town toNorth Eastas always and we are right in the middleof a pretty big intersection so itshouldn't be too too hard to pinpointI think this is the intersection hereum I think it is okay let's guess therethen oh okay I was getting worried thereuh since I was struggling with thefinding that Lake but uhpersistent space and was it it wasbarely on the very border of the like inthe southern hemisphere but yeah the sungoes up and down so so it makes senseyou could get Shadows going to the Southeven if you're in the
