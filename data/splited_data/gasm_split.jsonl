there should be a building like thisthen if that is the flag of Kazakhstanuh there is a big road goingum let's seethat has to have some sort of a specialname that's probably the parliament orsomethingthe road is going southuh and North oh[Music]okayumsoI took a whileumbecause as it happens uhum they specifically said that thecompass is never wrong but look at thisumso this is the flag of KazakhstanI'm absolutely certain of this that wasthe beginning of this so this isKazakhstan and we are in Astana what wasmy guessuh then I started looking around and Iuh I saw that the river is going here tothe south on the south side and westside so I looked at this and I waslooking for stuff here because the riverwould be on the south and the west sideit's only after I looked at the Sun andI realized that the sun is in the Norththe sun is in the north that means thatwe would be in the southern hemispheredeep in the southern hemisphere so I gotreally confused about this until Irealized that this simply cannot be thecompass has to be wrong it has to be infact as backwards again the compass isexactly wrong it is Kazakhstan flag andalso there are other tips here as wellthere is acrylic there is no place insouthern hemisphere that has kerylicafter I realized that the sun is in theabsolute wrong direction I realize thatwe are exactly on the opposite side ofthe river so I finally found uh my placehere so we haveumlovers Park here big Parkuh on the side of it there is a roundbuilding like this these were theeasiest ones to find then you havesomething here called the circle theroad goes through the circle so you seeit here we are on that road right hereit's going up and right next to us is uhthis building hereuh calledI guess the Triumph of Astana orsomething like this so we are right herethere is a football field here and somebuildings here so these lines upperfectly if I look down I can see thatwe are pretty much on top of or in thein the corner of this road that iscoming fromuh from this building right here and itlines up with the fourth building on theother side there are four buildings hereso it lines up with this one we arein the middle of of this one my guess isis this one it was a bit more difficultmaybe than the previous ones but knowingKazakhstan flag uh this wasn't too hardit's just the fact that that the compasswas actually wrong uh after theypromised that it isn't so it took me awhile but I will edit that out so youdon't have to worry about it I'm justtelling you I probably looked around forabout 10 minutes so thank you for thatwhoever made this map I would like tohave my 10 minutes back if you couldsend it to me in on a private message orsomething like this that would be reallynice thank you very much let's see whatMr Geo guesser has to say about this ohmy goodnesswe're up on a building this reminds meof the other map I used to play bird'seye bird's eye viewthis could be harder this look at thecolors of these houses insane buildingsthat one over thereI've got an ideabut it's nothing more than an absolutepunch in McDonald's down thereat first I thought they look and they dolook quite Norwegianum or Icelandic or even sort ofsomewhat Slovakianno Eastern European but I don't thinkit's eastern Europe just look at theseand I think look how spread out they areis that something you would find inEastern Europe looking at this from anarchitectural point of view very typicalof these former Soviet Asian countriesis that they build very bombastic uhcapitals like golden buildings there andand so on they might not be veryrepresentative of the architecture ofthe country generally I don't know muchabout Kazakhstan but I doubt that itlooks like this all over the place thatmight be the reason why there's allsorts of fields about the architecturehere and there is the giveaway guysthere's a bloody flag it'sum it's found it well what is thecapital these days is it Astana I thinkit is Astana but they changed the nametouhI did I think they changed the name tosomething like not so Sultan but ohthere it is actually Nur Sultan yeah NurSultan is the is the name of the of thecapital nowadays I think we've got waterover there to the eastdoesn'tand now he's running the same problem asI did the compass is wrong yeah whoknows how long he's spending time herealso uh looking in all the wrong placesit's

also play The Challenge frombeginning to the end to make it moreeasy for you you know like logisticallymore easy if there is a text here sothat we should probably be red of courseyou know where these are but do youeach famous place has the originallocation plus one look-alike locationlet's see if you can recognize theoriginal landmark and if you canpinpoint where its look-alike is30 famous local locations 30 look-alikesthat actually sounds like I'm gonna doterribly on this if you remember my fakeTaj Mahal video I also did not take verykindly to people making things that looklike Taj Mahal so let's head right intoit hi hello everyone why am I grinning Idon't know it's been a while how not totravel America gracing your screens verysoon not before the trailer which willbe out in a week or sonow though guys it's Geo guesser timeit's geoghasm time that's what he wantedto say uh I'm gonna let you guys playalong with this one no movingand no time limit as he said no timelimit but also no movingokay wellthat seems fair enoughdid you make thosedoes she look guilty did she make thesestatues likeokay so if the idea is to know whetherthese are real or notI'm gonna go out on a limb and say thatthere is no chance in hell that theseare not real or they are quite smallthough aren't they supposed to be big ohthis one is quite big so yeah so mypoint is that there's quite a lot ofthem and they look like they have beenthere a while so I would be verysurprised if these were somebody's ideaof of a fun Pastime to to build thesethings and then pass them off as as realones on top of that this is definitelyon the sea which is where these shouldbeso these are the famous uh I wanted tosay Talking Heads but I don't think theytalk but they are in the uh EasterIslands now this is indeed a goodquestion do I know where Easter Islandsare I'm not completely sure I think theyare somewhere here butwhere are they actually called EasterIslands or not or are they called BoraBorathat sounds somehow familiar to me BoraBora or is it just because it's so likeuhvery Dancy Place Bora BoraBora Boraum so yeah I don't know I think I doknow where Easter Islands are not therebut I do not know exactly where EasterIslands are that's the problem so thismight actually take a while there areall sorts of little Islands here whichone of these is the Easter are you theEaster Islandno it doesn't even look like the EasterBunny you know this is not so easy as Ithought it would be Mommyforeignthat sounds very much to me like that uhEaster Island[Music]yeah why aren't they my statues orsomething like that so I think I foundthe island finally uh it actually sayskapanuiand didn't I see something like thishereI I totally saw that Rapa Nui yesso I think this is the right place thisperson has clothed from the right placeso now the question is if if we are inthe right place we are lookinguh straight to the Southsothis would make sense herethis we haveum Hills behind usand we have a rock coming outfrom the south west there is a hill hereI'm thinking this seems like the rightplace let's see the roads there are someroads hereuh do this make any sense one road isgoing thereone would maybe go somewhere here itcould be this one but then we would havea road goingdown that would beI don't know does this go somewheretough to say So based on the the depthmap here I'm thinking rather that thiswould be this rockthen there is another one coming outlike thiswhich I don't quite seebut that could be very close we couldfor instance be ratherherewhere we would have this PuntaBaya not really not seeing that eitherokay after after looking around for awhile uh I don't really know I can'treally interpret the landscape so well Ithink thisum this here isuh this one here but I can't understandthe distance from this picture I don'tknow what this one is hereumbut it could simply be something likethis land coming coming up there at somepoint very difficult to sayum there is a mountain or a hill uhbehind us that makes a lot of senseumto see like if there's a hill here thatlet's see would that it will turn anddisappear somewhere uh there so wewouldn't see anythinguh but it's very difficult to say thereis a house here in the distance that Icannot see so Southwestthere is nothing on the map that pointsto any house uh but anyway I think weare on the right Island these are real Ihope so because I spent some timelooking around and I'm going to uh guessthis place but before that I'm gonna seewhat Mr chill wizard has to say aboutthis those are the heads on EasterIsland surely surely they are theoriginals that looks like some sort ofMaori thing KappaNui or something sun is in the north sothat would support the idea that we'reat Easter Island so where is EasterIsland that's also nice to see that healso doesn't know where Easter Island isso I thought that was the the Geoguesser here that doesn't know but healso doesn't know it's not somethingthat you look up from the map very oftenthis might take me a little while tofind I think it would say Easter Islandunless it's one of those things wherethey've changed its name he did sayEaster Islandjust not in English I think it is thisand that they've changed the name of iton the map to hang a rower right we justgot to look now at the coastline it'sit's going to be interesting because myother guess would be thishunger those were the two guesses I hadbut I decided to go with the other onewhich I might end up regretting I thinkhe's gonna go with this one there is themuseum there that would correspondpossibly with the building there but Ithink the building wasn't quite on theon the coast and here on the map itshows it's really on the coast so I'mthinking it's it's not that place but II don't know it's very difficult toassess distances on on this picturewherever we are we're in line withflipso if we drew a line from the cliff Edgeis quite cool actually to thatso that would put us ahthat would put us more like thereand that could be it now we've got to beherewe've got to be here I'm just going toclickthat's too far away anyway so I think Ithink we are therelet's have a go Wit oh I was rightor 980 I was wrong okay let's let's justcheck mine uh my guess hereumwas uh closer it was a little bit moreto the west but yeah that area was thecorrect area indeed it's that uh vocallength or whatever it's it's very it'scaused the picture to be very flattenedeverything looks to be very close infact the clips back in the distance haveto be very far away"}

the real one thequestion is where are these this lookslikeumChinese script or it could be Japanesethey look Japanese text is Japaneseumsowe are somewhere in Japan where they areshowcasing these uh these statues or uhreplicas of them at leastthat's pretty easy to see that they arereplicas but where are we we are in theeast coast of Japanum nothing else to be seen here thiscould be an islandoh hiI love this age when kids like they knowhow to walk but the walking is alwayssomehow awkward that's really funny toto watch them do thatand clearly this this kid has justlearned to walk because that is walkingbehind to to to catch the kid Okay sowe could bein one of the islands herewhat ifone of these islands haslikethere is a zoo for instance a village ofthe sea uh there is some kind of amonument here so this looks like a verygood option for being an island wherethey would have put these things I'mthinking we are in some kind of somekind of Island I'm not gonna spendforever here don't worry I'm just gonnacheck if I happen to actually comeacrossuh this thing uh there is a toilet I sawa toilet so maybe it's this one I'mobviously joking but it could be thatone I'm not gonna go through all theislands and all the possible areas inJapan that would be Insanity I'm goingto go with the first one that makes somesense and that would be this OshimaIsland that has a zoo park why well wehavebutterflies here that pizza zoo parkdoesn't it we got some other stuff herenot sure what that is but there issomething more than just these thingsthis is not just an ordinary park thereis a building there up in the hills sothis could totally be a zoo park forinstance though it doesn't have thatsort of a cliff to the east what aboutthis area here yeah I would really wantit to be that zoo park but I don't thinkit is I don't know what that is but I'mgonna go here and because there is likean area like this straight to the likeSoutheast so it's gonna be like thismaybe I'm just gonna go thereand see what happens let's see if Geowizard knows where this is oh my Godso this is theso maybe this map is programmed to giveyou the originaland thensomehowthey give you the alternative the thecopy or the other way around so this isthe copy you'd have to be pretty dumbto think that this was the originalbecauseI agree you've got Asian writing as wellhaven't youyeah you've got like Japanese writingthere oh look at this little toddlertoddling over yeah that's that's themost interesting part about this picturethat looks Japanesethat I'm not sureGreek almostit's really confusing what is that thereis something odd about that script Ihave to uh admit I wonder if we can beon one of theseyou know ah is that a map of the islandit looks a bit squared isn't it it looksa bit like runescaping I thought thatwas the map of the the park whateverthat is but yeah I guess it could be amap of the island that's not toodissimilar no look at thatisn't it the upside down it's likeit should be the upside down but I stillwonder why would they have a map of thewhole island there why wouldn't like ifyou are in a some sort of a zoo or amuseum area or something like a park orwhatever you generally have a map ofthat Park and not the whole uh Islandunless it's a very small island almostidentical to that but flipped flippedaround yeahto Japanese peoplearoundyou can see theboxy bitthereapologies if I'm wrong about thisI think I am wrong actually it comes toofar down here it's pretty close screw itI'm gonna go back to the upside downmath screw it will go herehow wrong could this beum whatlook at that we were actually on Japanyeah so I'm just gonna make my guess aswell so clearly the idea that this wouldbe an island was simply wrong and thatprobably made it pretty much impossibleto find it because no sane person isgoing to go through the east coast ofJapan trying to find this place unlessthey're in insane sane person I was alittle bit closer probably but a verymediocre result I think it's much moreimportant to be able to find the actualEaster Island and these Maui statuesit's uh San Mesa oh there it isdifferent models of Easter Islandstatues it is possible to find butnobody would zoom in that close and gothrough the whole of Eastern Seashore ofJapan I think it's impossible to get ifyou do not knowaround"}
