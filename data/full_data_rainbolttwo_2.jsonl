Kenya I guess like what else could this be yeah uh is this the seven is it this there's probably the nine it's going north south yeah and then Australia this is a boring SE I think is this sa somewhere over here okay I'm redoing that that's a great score I'm redoing that I mean if you guys sending that to my friends it's just a little silly you guys know me you won't have to like think about the country like you know this looks like Northern Norway or something thing right surely I'm going play this a little bit quicker because no one wants to watch this twice this is the UK in it

what is this am I tripping tripping I'll just go on the n n here a little more south okay this is not going to be a good guess for me Cola or EA I kind of like EA here but this could be this could be Indonesia actually wait I have to commit now it's be Indonesia though isn't it Lanka was not g Sri Lanka that and this is just like Northern Finland Southern Finland okay well let me look at this again it's oh we have a the pole here uh that's Shri Lankan top of the Shri Lankan pole there that you could get confused with Thailand for but I did not see that in that time all right let's uh let's

hard to make nothing out something sometimes but um yeah daily challenge tomorrow also LLY winning in the Water by hedging Sweden Finland is a power move um q& no daily challenges and um yeah I guess watch the World Cup the Asia qualifiers if you want but to be honest you guys probably won't because it's at like 2: a.m. western coast time if you're up at 3:00 a.m. you can watch it until it's going to be like till like 8 a.m. so maybe if you wake up at like 8 a.m. you can watch it and I just got Mega blurry what a great way to finish this off let's I'll see you guys next in a couple days ",

right it's another day to play the game G and another day to wake up with the privilege to use your nogin and it's another day to not cope we're turning on the hide score script again as you just saw so I won't know what score I got until after the game is over because it hides every single ounce of anything that would tell me what the score is also the video yesterday never got uploaded because I actually deleted half the footage if you guys want Link in the description to watch RC's segment and song of to day and a Roundup 10 40 seconds V world with no coping because I haven't done this in a while I figured why not round one looks like Japan um low cam potentially yes um no PS or anything to guess off of okay so we going to do that look southernish to me I'm gonna go not Obama this time joke's kind of done we go there hopefully that's a good guess Tunisia with hills don't know I'm going Central it's an East West Highway though when the only Road covering Tunisia is this road right here or these like these Eastern roads which is so is it like near like spax or something like where do you start going east west like this maybe it's like down here where it's slightly more East West like south of south of saax we'll see o Greece looks like Greece wooden pulls double white CER lines northern Greece probably maybe near Albania or something like this is it ever an island don't think so I don't know how I'm doing right now this could be bad this could be good this is Brazil looks North we have slight Hills in the back something like P or something Northern bajia yeah I thing is I can't even cope because I hear me out guys I lowkey want to go this city up here well if this is a city up here you know I mean spots wanted but the obvious answer is just Gabon you know but like I kind of want to risk it for the biscuit I think I'm right no I don't why would I say that now I kind of have to commit it what do I think my score is 17 18,000 probably I think the Brazil probably lost 1,000 points Max that bot Swan is probably south Brazil or South bot Swan or east bot Swan probably lost like a, 1,00 points there um yeah let's see okay well I called it it was just own and uh

near Charlotte Town SOI it a little East but the M grass was true okay do you go Mountain here or like near Mound it's like slightly white dirt pretty maybe near uh what's it called not maybe you see like Palms there though I think it's on the way to Mountain though I really do what a nice little shade she has there yeah I'm gonna go somewhere here there's a Road North sure okay on the other side Mound but it was the road to Mound Argentina we have the massive Argentina pole here what the heck it's like the trifecta uh ba a little more West maybe I kind of I just want to go ba here H I mean do I go like so far I'm playing pretty well for the I mean both those are pretty freebies but I kind of want to continue the streak of getting top three in 42 I'm GNA go VA could be Rosario but there's something over here maybe a little more West but actually could be it looks pretty dry yeah Rosario just a little boy from Rosario Bangladesh round four will not be a blunder like how g go north here I kind of really want to go north I very much want to go north just getting a we'll go we'll go here dude okay is this fard it's not wait is this wait am I tripping where would you get this is this Greenland oh no I mean it looks like spard but like where would you get water West and and long longar bean because I don't think there's coverage elsewhere is there I mean is this even map to it's not there let's go downtown [ __ ] I don't know okay 237 that's like four three days in a row I've done really well on this seed but that was like a free seed is this even mapped properly no it's not okay I'm going to do one more cuz like whoever would have won that seed would have won but like 10 points and that's just like kind of kind of CR this Bhutan looks like Bhutan some East [ __ ] it nice okay round two oh okay wait what is this what plate is that why does it look like a Utah plate or something is that New Mexico Old Town Artisans artisians um orange plate there is kind of crazy I guess I go Mexico Arizona here maybe Arizona what city is this like I thought it could have been alberquerque or something but might go like Tucson I I do go New Mexico go like set like I just don't know I don't know what plate that is I think it's a New Mexico plate though isn't it or no maybe it is Arizona oh nice Tucson damn okay I'm playing again really well this looks like California or what are these ballards I actually don't know these ballers maybe that's not California M I think I have to go like up north C something up here Utah maybe that was Utah Ballard I don't know oh is this Alaska I think this is Alaska East West Road in Alaska probably somewhere over here wait I'm going to get some Tik Tok is this a bad guess I think that's probably a bad guess I should probably go but what if it's not what if it is Tik Tok East West Road it's definitely downtown Tik [Music] Tok that's okay it was Alaska wait what is this I'm going to Fumble this is this Mexico why is it so wait is this like CD I'm just going cdmx here like all right well yeah I mean that Utah one's going to hop me but that's okay I've been playing well on ABW I have not been playing well on skewed so lock in 10 seconds run it okay I'm going to go Souther Ukraine here because I think it could be Russia but I do think it could be like the net or like somewhere down here it was just Southern Russia okay um what am I looking at dude not Spain Italy no turkey no I have no idea what to guess reunion it's a very very very very very very hard rate Union maybe if I Brazil Colo Brazil Peru it has to be Peru is this South Africa right it's not Brazil I've had better days I've had better days what we looking at like this uh maybe like PO is more Colombian yeah I mean sure um yeah I mean I probably won't be alone in Brazil but most people probably go Mexico and the South Africa one I really thought was Brazil so maybe people go Brazil in that but we'll see very very difficult um I had a good day on the 42nd I cannot wrap it up on the uh 10 second but let's see how everyone else does uh ban okay okay why is everyone know the road right fair enough Oldtown Artisans oh this is [Music] um I think it's like Tucson and it's like uh let me think where was that area oh it's like here yeah yeah I think it's like or like here or one up but yeah okay or like one straight down there we go like the valley like maybe this one mountains are far to the West yeah I think I think I'm going to go like here ah no never mind oh that's kind of tough okay and then this is like here I think surely it's this rad does that make sense I hope I'm not I think it is this I'll leave it there I don't know oh okay it wasn't oh was this road yeah I mean random White Road that's kind of tough because I mean yeah I guess up to here it's like paved and then it becomes unpaved further on cool but yeah I didn't get that VI okay no I hope it's not Mexico I I generally don't know I think it's like salta if it's AR no what is Mexico God damn it I actually threw so hard oh no I don't know how anyone goes reunion on that Simon's lowkey go like what quite tough maybe Simon has a very tall monitor where you can see [Music] the

right it's another day to play the game of J guys it's another day to wake up with the privilege to use your Noggin round one game one water North in Australia this my first guess uh it could be like rotness or something you can't see any other land though North so maybe we're not here where would you get water North this it's definitely like South Australia or something that over here but the soil doesn't look it looks more white like the soil over there would be more red okay this mouse I'm trying to get used to it zooms out way too much maybe it's like something over here because you can't see like this has how's that there wait what direction were we looking that's like looking northish like I guess it's looking more West but like this is way different than this in my opinion I don't know I'm okay with my k guess there honestly I just assumed we would see land if we were over there but I guess I was looking West how are we not how do you not see this though like what how's it not in view it can't be that far what am I tripping round two is just most obvious Texas I've ever seen holy crap um does this ever look more Texas in your entire life somewhere over here West it's Oklahoma border I I thought like Oklahoma border with the right reddish soil but all right is that water West in Chile probably near Santiago somewhere over here on the five maybe a little more south how far south do I want to go do I want to go more South it's hard to judge it's hard to judge I like the climate it was right there I should just start clicking on the road bro like I should just start clicking on roads it would make this way more beneficial what am I looking at I thought this was Kenya it's not Kenya what is this Argentina wait I was so confused for a second that okay I don't know where to guess here this might be a really bad guess like really really bad wait why are the mountains like wait is this a really bad guess oh this is going to be I it's round four so it's inevitable okay now I'm just kind of good at this game sometimes guys like only a couple times and then survive pavement to end it all off oh my God it's that same island ah dude I don't go in that Island oh dude that's so I mean we looked at this island a couple days ago or like like a couple months ago I mean I only lost 500 points and I played that seed pretty perfectly honestly well actually no it's actually it's actually an ironically easy seed like that is pretty perfect but like you can still get closer in Texas and uh Australia and Java or and uh yeah Java um but I'm very happy with that like I've had two good days now in a row on the 42nd not too bad for a washed up Tik tocker am I right all right 10 seconds on the clock I'm feeling good about this one I'm feeling good North Island New Zealand surely C over here Palmer North okay kind of the goat uh wait Bangladesh or Indonesia Bangladesh or Indonesia I'm going to go indo I'm doing it it's it's just Dubai I'm not doing it I was about to guess water but uh two new zealands are you kidding me like okay no I'm not doing that like I know I went wrong country on that but like two new zealands a UAE and a Sagal is like the most boring way possible to do a skewed world like a like come on let's be serious here looks North wait that was an insane guess wait what the [ __ ] is that a Canadian flag I am just saddened that that scream has to now live on the internet what is this get me out of this game bro get me out of this game get me out of this game get me out of this game is this Hawaii um yeah the day this is a good day though this was a good day let's see not to sneeze wait looky this looks like a round we had didn't we we had something like this maybe it's like Tasmania actually wait was it that like remember that crazy Tasmania we had it was like over here actually wait I think it is that Tasmania lock now that I think about it where was that okay no it was just here never mind oops you know what I was talking about this like a exactly it looked no one went Tasmania on it at all yeah yeah okay Texas this a Tex um yeah no this one is Texas dude this is not Texas well we'll just have to see I think it's like somewhere in this general area maybe I'll head one more yeah it was a little more North I still got nice Coastline we got there divider Highway probably thinking this rad right yeah I mean this one would work fairly well I think even the angle seems kind of fine um yeah I'll try it okay nice oh damn didn't even click on the road but fair enough we have mountains west sugar cane I think you have to go like tucuman probably here it's possible but maybe I want to hedge more North then go here no it's just 2 okay uh o this is interesting with the pole sticking up like that I want to say it should be East Java maybe I mean I think it should be yeah we have the pavement I didn't even think about the pavement okay should be oh wait dud it's that one Island dude I had the exact same reaction I thought the houses looked a little weird for East Java like this house definitely I can see being that Island rather than East Java it is what it is with the Tasmania I you played well I think that was literally your only yeah is this Hokkaido it's like tohoku or Hokkaido it's gonna be tohoku yeah it's tohoku okay it's fine Ontario are those blue thingies in Ontario meta there are similar ones in the US but when it's Canada yeah you go Ontario basically okay I don't know no I don't like my guess Russia it's not Russia it's what that's a crazy Greece how is trior getting that I have no idea actually the Europe go okay this like a here sort of or maybe more East okay good good no idea I go Philly is it ever Hawaii no it's never Hawaii oh it's P Rico you know the mailbox felt American but I don't know what it would be I mean the only reason I went Hawaii was because the mailbox and it looks tral I I thought about Hawaii but I thought the concrete road would be very strange uh I mean I don't think anyone got I think people that went USVI got like 4,000 points though so yeah that's funny I mean fair enough all right good game GG's not GG's yet but song of the day your ears don't get pregnant ooh so clap your hands and yell hooray it's song of the day yeah song of the day is lavender by Disclosure thank God o okay wait this is a bob it goes so hard ch yeah you brought the heat today my brought the heat all right GG's GG's all right it's next day 96 Bulls are on top 25 people playing today and uh jhb tomorrow is a new day round one yeah like how would you ever go somewhere with water West there like everyone here going with water North hedging water north um couple people in South Australia New Zealand Taz round two Texas snil great guess in Texas there majority people going Texas round three was Chile uh Jacob doing Jacob things getting getting the exact 5K there RC consis on the road to potic and Anna not too far behind around four uh probably should guess more in the mountains there but great guess there by everyone going north arge I thought it was weird for a second I'm not sure why I thought it was something else but and shout out to Blinky trior and Lenley tricker and Lenley making it easier um for gting the island right there everyone's going near Caba okay let's see if anyone got that right I doubt it I mean I started off strong with that great Japan guess round two it just flustered the blue things I realized were the on meta that I forgot but uh yeah I just got fluster in that one should have locked in not sure what what like brought me there but and the fact that Trier got this right is actually like goat activities Spain Southern Russia Bulgaria Romania all makes sense turkey easy and then this one did anyone get this right no one got Puerto Rico on that but if you went USVI you got a lot of points any Hawaii guessers tons of Hawaii people or four American Samoa makes sense actually a lot uh nmi Guam Philly Indo yeah like Brazil not sure if that makes sense Chum but it's okay I'm just kidding snail gets seven I'll take or Frank I'll take 10 Linley we'll get five and then we have Jacob getting [Music] for here getting two and South by gets two and I will see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -5.753315340299607, "lng": 112.72429794504755}, {"round": 2, "lat":

right it's under day to play the game J and Su day to wake up with the privilege to use your nogin round one game one let's lock in looks like it's going be hungry or something I'm just going to inent Hungry on this I just woke up from a 4-Hour nap so please bear with me if my brain is not working I quite literally did wake up to use my nogin is it ever a fringe Pole right there I feel like that could be a French Pole yeah I think it was a French pole round two what is this bro okay okay interesting Sun South oh [ __ ] okay uh I thought imately this fencing was like Chile in but now I think we're back in Europe here I have no idea where to guess is this every the US ah [ __ ] I'm going back in France okay winning down France it out this is probably just um probably right Red Road is zand okay let's see if we can find the thing we're on not gotland right W more East okay is this Argentina or Chile or is this Argentina or what is this like Southern [Music] Argentina I can't if this is Southern Argentina or southern Chile oh F what is this it looks like super south or some [ __ ] bro like I'm this is a blunder or do I go north because it's kind of dry okay I somehow got away from that unscathed we'll take that what was it round four it was round four and then round five is bangl dashh okay I mean I'm just G copyright is it I can't find the copyright yeah I'm just gonna go DACA because I'm a coward let's think though maybe it's more south I'm gonna risk for the biscuit some like down here it make sense [Music] all right why they do that not sure um kind of a boring seed but also kind of a fun SE because both those Frances were not really that Gable and the southern Argentina was not I don't think that easy either so I'm okay with that should I do another one I think it's probably fine I feel like sometimes I when I do well I think it's just automatically boring but in reality it's just kind of like I played well all right 10 seconds though lock in lock in round one uh what is this maybe I go near like I mean somewhere I forgot to place down I was wased trying to guess Tamworth there one time I was in the news in Tam okay somewhere in Brazil go like this maybe a little more south okay go me do here Moscow probably just Moscow if you're being honest with ourselves chin sure I guess I go like Alabama Mississippi something that's a great guess in Tennessee that's just a great guess and then me personally I would never go UAE on guitar never RC I'm in with you in solidarity today all right I mean yeah honestly kind of a slower day or like maybe a little less entertaining because I just woke up from a 4our nap and it's currently 800 p.m. and forgot to uh record this before so it's kind of just foring this out to stay on schedule but um yeah let's see uh how everyone else does hungry Romania I mean the lines don't really feel Romanian yeah I think you go Hungary although it's kind of weird it's like slightly off for Hungary lot wind turbines I don't know where that would be yeah I think I'd just have to go hungry CU I don't really really know like I don't think it's Bulgaria it feels too I mean maybe like here in Bulgaria but I feel like Hungary is just the best option okay it's France really it's very strange we have like Pines sun is like kind of South maybe I don't know soil color is very weird I'm I wasn't even sure on the continent to be honest it is just Europe but it's kind of weird maybe like a turkey or something like here like European turkey I genely don't know okay what the [ __ ] France okay this is alland I think okay trying to figure out this is like arge I think this the hill is just thring me off I feel like I know I'm gonna go no Ken but I'm not sure okay it's even more south yeah oh this is lovely they're having such a nice time here so the houses are like more Eastern trees aren't really saying anything like for Ming so I think you just go DACA here yeah and I'm just going to go like a central DACA okay yeah it was daa more of the story is [ __ ] France but it's fine could have been worse at least I want Europe on both those cuz that second one was tough the second one I almost went Chile on that um for some reason no I was thinking like Brazil Mexico stuff like that yeah like with the pin I actually almost thought us too yeah yeah yeah I also like thought about it um this is when I don't know if it's I think it's Victoria yeah okay okay um ever Sor good ooh okay this is giving me like a very here s Vibe somewhere in this general area okay it's fine no not this bro I'm going qar this time K actual trauma Trauma from my guess look at my guess UAE are you in the UAE I'm downtown Dubai baby dude actually like the worst 50/50 ever surely someone bro no one else went dude I actually I actually I feel like no one else went UAE last time when I went so I I feel you yeah I took that roll for I feel you're p i a good 42 you can't you can't win them all I mean if if I if I expected anyone to know Memphis it would be it makes sense with the red though like the red well actually I was just Hing Mississippi like Arkansas type thing yeah I don't know what do you call these houses bro like these Mansions or not Mansions but like I feel like these like uh this is like such a standard like Southern us like yeah yeah for sure like I think it's the fact that they use the The Rock on the front and like the big roofs yeah it's like pointy I don't know bro there's something that are just like so like Southern like upper M middle class Like Houses all this or all the same and it's like same suburbs with a random pond with like yeah it's very very common little disappoint that the road is more red here but yeah the sidewalk is red at least yeah yeah Brownsville I don't think I know any lore about Brownsville to be honest let me see if I have any markers in brown I do not isue what's that nothing interesting in Brown looks kind of boring wow see riveting stuff here in Denmark Tennessee maybe the fact it's in Denmark is why you saved it true look at this one should this should be a segment we just go through your saves and it's got a nice little Clock Tower what else they got anything decent here they got some wings King of Wings King of Wings yeah could be could be good let's look at their drivethru that place that place that place is definitely cash only and definitely serves the best wings you've ever heard in your life yeah exactly 20 years I mean they're going WR wait what's the reviews that [ __ ] will change your life wait yeah basically this place is amazing and I got to go take a nap well that's a good sh Soul be careful your ears don't get pregnant ooh so clap your hands and yell hooray it's song of the day yeah all right song of the day today is Drive Me Crazy by l yachty o that one it's a good song it's from his album that came out last year I really actually enjoyed the album sh the little boat little boat GG's all right it's the next day there is 24 people playing this one Frank the hunk great game round one was France Deb BR doesn't that count because this is his map but jamad and Chumley I like the hungry guessers I think hungry is the right guess I'm going to see if this was a French pole in the background actually or maybe I'm just like lying there's no fren pole at all in the distance whatsoever there's that's

water East I can't find anything else with water East oh you scan the whole freaking Coast I think I'm in Chile now I am oh it was there okay nice I didn't even 5K because I didn't click on the road kind of a Skillets Shue all right Urban Europe V is [Music] Dustin I mean you want to go like Austria or like czechia Slovakia here I'm not entirely sure wait those houses in the back feel kind of Norwegian like the it looks like that one house in Bergen with the hotels on the water um uh from the music video from [Music] Kao dude my score right now is uh pretty good okay let's throw it all the way shall we like what the [ __ ] is this bro I was going so well oh no my ring light just fell over okay I caught it um why is this house full Asian everything else feels Mediterranean but I don't know if this is South Africa or Greece or Spain what the heck I'm looking at here like at all there's no there's a shutter there maybe it is Italy or something with a shutter yeah I have no idea what this is Mexico is potential I don't know that's a bad guess turkey or Greek island potentially is turkey so be it okay water East and Russia I have birds of feather or that new B song stuck in my head what water where this East it's not Lake it was Lake yesterday but this doesn't look like Lake does it looks like a different there's Mountains east too or west I wonder if it's more south or if it's more East looks kind of more northish I'm going to place it here for a second and then what other body of water could this be maybe something like a per looky well yeah we don't talk about that one let's not talk about that one all right screed World lock in locking 10 seconds on clock o fun Scotland I guess dude I'm going to go buy a new mouse like right this second well is okay um Spain yeah it's definitely Spain I see the yellow reflector I mean sure Bea what that's a crazy coverage Spain again Mexico I mean Yer is already boring enough I can't have back toback boring days this Russia or is this Canada or some [ __ ] this is intriguing in the back Western Russia okay St Louis or Dar car okay looks American why is the sun nor if I didn't see that sun last second I'm sending like Colorado in that bro like actually Asian gutter gen three what the [ __ ] is this I have no the kitos keto Ser is crazy for sure I mean I didn't know where an asent made sense for this at all with Gen 3 but the ketos does make sense with like that tropical there um I mean yeah I didn't mean to guess C I was trying to get to Borneo but uh all right well that was less boring but a fun day I would say all around I forgot what happened in the 42nd oh yeah I fumbled the Eastern Russia such is life such is life all right I'm gonna go buy a new mouse and um let's see how everyone else does presumably like Sal Paulo or somewhere nearby could be slightly more south as well maybe like kurich is possible I don't know I think I have to go souo though yeah okay it was more stth fair enough Coast maybe it's like wait what this is very strange like my first thought was like here somewhere but I feel like that doesn't really make sense is it ever like Ecuador or something okay it was Peru I mean yeah fair enough that's kind of annoying kind of reminds me of Bergen I don't know like here somewhere oh yeah that's definitely this thing right here okay yeah okay what am I looking at here I I honestly have no idea like Greek island or something like what I thought like a like one of these like Islands or something probably just do that okay yeah yeah I mean I went the the island not the not the turkey Mainland but like yeah body of water is kind of throwing me off because I didn't think we were at like by call there any other bodies of water that really makes sense it's not sockin right I don't think so feel like I kind of have to leave it here but I don't think we're here yeah it was sakin okay okay South Thailand probably like I don't know I have to HED here I think not sure on the country here if it's like Ukraine or Russia I kind of want to go Russia okay it was Russia and all the Ukraine people be me that's kind of annoying um Sagal and I think you just go to car here okay good don't I mean I thought France but I might be wrong it was wrong because New Zealand that's a tough one classic and then I don't know Ecuador it's probably wrong Peru okay yeah all right so song

directly I don't know I feel like it's somewhere on this road here maybe it's a little more south like down here oh that makes sense too I guess um because it is water West but I just assumed we'd be on the east side looking West instead of like on the east side on the inlet because it's like yeah that's findable though I guess in hindsight looks like Scotland presumably dude my mouse I'm never buying a Logitech mouse ever again in my life the software doesn't work the hardware every time I zoom in it zooms out randomly like round three round five um yeah probably just Ghana like South Ghana somewhere over here lowy like I'll reaching gu [ __ ] it we ball good enough all right well I play that fine um kind of a boring seed but honestly it was kind of a fun seed so I enjoyed that this is

good um uh Northampton okay oh silver silverstone's there okay I don't know what that was what is this um Italy guess you just go Rome where else could this be I mean literally anywhere else but dude my cusher does this thing where every time I zoom in it zooms out like it's the most frustrating thing ever all right this looks like Canada but like is it ever like just over here in like Ontario or is it ever like lowkey like Sask or is it ever just the US like Ohio or something is it a red plate I'm going to go over here in London okay that was a good guess um okay I'm ready to ruin my whole good guesses for this wait what why is there that pole that looks like an Ecuador pole but why would there be an Ecuador pole with this fencing and this single yellow road line what it's not Brazil is

that's a really cool location round two um yellow plates bring you home Country Roads uh Singapore surely um we're off to a great Pace right now we're only lost 200 points in round three with water South and Brazil it looks like it's going to be Southern Brazil because we have like the round PS here but I don't know if no that's not that um water South is it like up here like no you don't really get water South there get Salvador makes sense uh I don't know this could be like I don't think it's Rio or anything like that I mean it makes sense with wild you're South for Rio but like it doesn't really feel like that southern to me this could be a blunder um okay I'm okay with my guess there honestly Canada guess you have to go be is this water to our East wait can you guys tell if this is water am I tripping do these guys live on the water here like is there houses like on the water like over here kind of Wilson Landing um I guess you have to be somewhere over here like over here it's not in near B I don't think think um yeah who the [ __ ] goes there Cold Lake wait that's actually really really cool coverage I thought I saw like mountains though did I not I'm okay with my guess I just don't go Alberta on that and that's okay look Spanish and this will be a boring weit in the seed but I think this was a fun seed all around because uh it was uh that guess and I think that Sri Lanka lock was extremely cool so I'll I'll send this to my friends and this was actually really cool lock the Alberto lock was actually really fun because I think someone can get that if they've played C enough and I think we should reward that because that is a real cool location too with being right on the water like that so cool but yeah let's go go skew the world and finish it off also guys we won't have an R we won't have an RC POV today because it's his birthday and he's spending his birthday with his friends and family and not the daily challenge series as he should so let's get some Happy Birthday RC's in the comments and maybe the song of the day will be the Happy Birthday song all right 10 seconds on the clock let's lock in looks like like South uguay nice uh Nigeria looks Coastal like Port hardcour Benin dude I got Benin wrong yesterday that's really frustrating what city is this is this like an Italian city or Turkish Maybe I really hope someone gets that right I really hope someone gets that right I have never been more conf I mean like what is this Austria or Switzerland is this Lam can't tell Austria I guess I'll go near it's Northern Italia that's still a fine guess um I don't know this pole I go Northern Japan though that was kaida okay let me cope about this real quick was there anything haido here it looked like haido I guess it's really funny all right happy birthday RC and let's see how everyn does all right it's next day and Gorka again is popping off on the 42 see 24 people playing let's see how everyone did round one was Sri Lanka okay uh yeah everyone getting kind of this region of Sri Lanka there we'll take that round two was Singapore where did Mack guess on round one maybe he just couldn't get to S Lanka in time maybe he's a he's a trackpad user maybe today all right let's see who got the coast here and uh uh Brazil an totic CG and gor G the 5K Blinky and Oscar but is that five no 5K and 5K for both them and Blinky missing two points it'd be like that sometimes um probably a couple people hopefully down here yeah snails GC consis Linley pooki trior Linley and trior Jacob and axel all with me snail uh go Rio yeah could be more south it'd be like that I think de's up here on the island yeah okay round four no one got albera on this that's actually really really funny I was expecting at least someone to get Alberta like one person but yeah I mean everyone at Vancouver Island which is the obvious answer I feel like um yeah with all the water East there yeah I mean that's a good that that might be a thumbnail um yeah I mean everyone getting Canada but uh yeah it's kind of crazy and in Spain yeah did Gorka make a good guess yeah gor of course hard to beat Gorka in Spain the Spanish goat and then 10 second here we had the Uruguay Southern uguay there everyone getting uguay kind of free this was the Nigeria CG getting Benin debor getting first place here uh to and Jacob um I thought it was more south maybe I don't know but everyone kind of getting that region so it's still kind of good round three was the India yeah wow out to trior bokei to poic De Jacob and maam Deb knew the city I'm sure he's probably seen it before but it's so impressive um to remember that and to get that again this isn't his map this is skewed world so this is a random map Oscar G India we have a Bhutan all over um Europe yeah in hindsight maybe I could have seen it was a treer and guess where there was unofficial coverage or treer coverage more likely but I thought since it was CU we were just facing the sidewalk and not on the sidewalk um but yeah that's uh shout out to everyone that got the Western India here that's really impressive that was oh the Austria yeah oh wow or the Northern Italy totic Gorka CG and Deborah ging Northern Italy they're a lots of people in Austria here couple people in Slovenia makes sense is a Slovenian in Slovenia he is shout out to Simon and shout out to Luca as I'm watching this as I'm recording this Mavericks are currently up like 33 so I was like what better way when I'm Bard than to just everyone getting North Japan here um deor again great guess gor getting five Oscar gets 17 uh and Blinky gets 12 10 seconds we got de getting his first three uh totic getting seven and Jacob getting also Jacob officially is in the G world record books so shout out to him for being the uh

Western in like Sonora or Baja um so I'll go Sonora here because I think it makes more sense and it was that road okay or maybe it was a white Road right there round two looks like Poland not New Zealand slight Hills do you want to go North Hills and do I rescue for the biscuit when I have one good guess or do I go Southern Hills which is the more obvious answer I'll go round three what is this driving right single yellow is this Russia someone help me someone help wait we have 15 seconds is this Russia what am I looking at I have no idea what I'm looking at guys like I don't even know where to guess this is not right so be it I have no idea it was the bridge to Sero I'm actually just glad I got Rush on that I guess I just clicked near water at the end but I I I don't know that's it's one of those things that you only get right if you've seen uh the bridge before I don't know if you get that without that like landscape wise um it looks like here we can see on the right we might have uh a similar poll as we had in the other day I think it'll be Cali we also have a similar ballards where we had like those ballards in uh this region of Sula but um my fake meta of the day is that if you get a single yellow road line in Indonesia just send sesi or C Manon but this is not that because it's a fake meta um what if it is CI though okay it was the same poll as the other day that's why we play the game you learn from your mistakes round three round five why they say round three quick maths South Africa all right hear me out is this over Australia nah nah I feel like it's downtown Esa like it feels like lowkey just downtown Esa looks weird though it should be like something over here let's do two okay that was a fine guess okay well I played well besides my Russia guess I think and um I should just went North Hills Poland but I'm a little scaredy cat like maybe I could cope about the uh or like the Sero run there but honestly I'm honestly just happy I got the country right so can't really be asked let's lock in though 10 seconds on skewed let's have at least one decent game here okay looks like it's gonna be Poland or yeah surely it's just Poland could be crazy hungry but round two B type Gill bpe G you go Western Germany on this you do go Western Germany on that that's a fine guess round three looks like Borneo like Southern like is it ever just like downtown sewalk like one of these cities looks like it could be it was seu okay this is not easy I want to go Spain or uh Portugal here um I think Spain's more likely if it's neither it's sad I don't

uh do I go here or do I go like Bim or do I go like more amial I don't know like that maybe makes sense I don't know okay it was more south that's fine I went way too North there all right Australia um Tam worth Hills ever go where's Tam worth at isn't it like somewhere up here you guys know the lore behind Tamworth if this is Tamworth I'll tell you it's close enough right one time I went on Australian news and they told me that okay lock in Peru uh it's super dry dude I want to go Max North here no I don't I'm going Max South okay close enough dud I feel like I've got like decently good guesses but like minus like a good guess you know all right Mexico let's let's just make one good guess here like on the East West Road in [Music] Mexico all right one wait to end it um yeah that was kind of boring like if I come on here and have audacity to say it's time to use your Noggin and we get a boring seed like that I cannot show my face this is what we want round one let's find a random Japanese Beach shall we South just go like Okinawa or like something down here which one of these has Gen 4 is a question you know is there beaches on here there's a beach there no doesn't really make sense um let me go more North is there beaches here the water South nope that doesn't make sense no beaches here either well this is a blunder let's go back to Mainland bro guest on Japan I don't deserve that I just don't deserve it okay round two um [Music] what is this bro what poles are these so raise me up so I is this Indonesia or Mexico bro it looks like [Music] Mexico I need to start like okay is this why does this look so Turkish but like it also looks extremely Austrian like this is the most Turkish looking off stream building I've ever seen in my entire life there's no water tanks on the top there's a reflection over here that doesn't look like why does this look so weird I have to go turkey here I'd be silly not to like Western turkey or some [ __ ] but like why does it look so Austrian or some [ __ ] like Bulgaria okay I don't know what I've been told uh what I do here do I just go banin probably what else would you do here if you me banon sure maybe that was other guess sure we're just reg guessing Nigeria I think this was a fun seed wait was this okay wait let's find this road I have a crazy shout I wanted Loki go like somewhere East on this road because we had those random Hills in Abuja Southwest of Abuja but these don't look like those Hills the easy guess here is bja well I want to go up here because there's some hills over here I feel like and this is an East West Road so like what if um sure was that fun I forgot if that was fun or not I think that was fun all right I think I got the exact same score on both so that's that's doable I don't really have anything to cope about today I'm just I guess I could cope about this Bulgaria I mean I mean this was just the luckiest guess of all time in Japan I listen I I need to I need to cope the cope gods are being nice to me today I need to maybe they saved all my cope for 10 seconds let's see round one not this one East West like [Music] that um excuse me um North South Road probably Jordan Southern Jordan why can't not zoom in like this that road okay um Brazil I'm not going Panama wait should I go Panama for the memes well if this is actually Panama oh my God so rent free okay we're fine what is this bro black plates is this Colo why is there plates like that the Mexico I'm not going to cope I'm not going to cope I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna go I'm not gonna go you actually gota be kidding me bro you actually go to be kidding me I hate this I hate this game why is this like a like a eucalyptus tree like Australia or some [ __ ] but it's not ever Australia New Zealand no [Applause] okay how's this Luxenberg I can see myself maybe going Europe I thought this was a eucalyptus tree the bottom of a eucalyptus tree for some reason um and hindsight Australia makes no sense at all like maybe with this rock wall ago like Japan or Taiwan or something but like I just thought that was a eucalyptus tree no one goes Luxemburg on that okay and I mean what do you want me to say on that one like what what do you want me to say let's see how everyone else does okay Sur this is okwa I mean yeah let find so lines up it's pretty east west yeah nope it was wait how did get that what the [ __ ] actually can't tell I think it's like a tiole so I guess I don't know I was thinking like down here somewhere unless it's like downtown Bangkok wait no it was Mexico oh my God what is this architecture I don't know if it's like Spain or like turkey kind of want to go with turkey oh Bulgaria I thought bubble G but that it was 2019 copyright I think so I guess you just go benon Anu I thought about Anu should have gone there okay or downtown abucha maybe just I don't know no it was a I mean okay I guess this is actually Tri guyre but uh I don't

day we're on good Pace okay let's not wait okay I'm GNA do something silly here I'm not I'm not I'm gonna go east coast because it looks like it's like nck or something but it lowkey looked like for a second like this region of water right here with these houses too but no it's just going to be nck there's water south or like something like over here like Long Island there oh Long Island's a great shout there's you can see land it's like over here in Connecticut I'm now I'm going Long Island I don't know yeah I'll try it dude it was there wait dude I'm popping off today what the [ __ ] what the hell it was literally there wait wait I'm actually cracked okay Brazil okay wait let's not choke this round four bro wait what the hell is happening okay uh Brazil dude if I choke the round five okay I'm assuming I get at least 4,000 points here so that's okay I might go a little more south like South Paulo because I'm kind of scared it's a little more south a okay lock in how is it that North dude what is this McDonald's s suus about you super I started so good what is this is this Denmark we have double White Road lines makes me think Poland this is never Poland though right double White Road lines Denmark Poland like double white Ro lines it's never Sweden or anything like that it doesn't really look dude if I miss Sweden two days in a row I'm actually be so mad but do Poland I don't know let's see that was Poland okay [Music] Brazil yeah I mean I can't complain SK let's lock in lock lock in r r what you do here you go Taiwan here probably could be something crazy but I want to go Taiwan Darwin is ever anything else something North here Kaku maybe was just Darwin round three looks like Romania or France one of the two let me go Romania if it's France so be it nice Norway Southern Norway dude what what am I doing today like what Poland I'm just sending Poland I don't care why did I do that wait why did I do that nope I don't care I don't care I was not ever going New Zealand on this I was never going New Zealand on this I was never going New Zealand on this no one is going New Zealand on this bro who the hell goes to New Zealand on this I'll say it now I'll give every single person that goes to New Zealand on this $50 PayPal that's how confident I am that no one goes New Zealand on this I'm not even mad at that I'm not even mad I had a great game n out of 10 guesses were really really good and I cannot complain I am never going to Zealand on that though and so be it let's see uh how every else does though okay I think it's like Madera L 5 cable no probably not but yeah oops AC clicked but okay then in round I mean I thought like New Jersey or something in that neck of the woods the water South is kind of weird but I don't really know it would work like Southwest I mean I didn't think it was Long Island but maybe I should go there yeah I should have gone there okay so maybe is Mata then or Mar yeah sure I think this Warsaw probably maybe Japan can't tell Taiwan I would have said like n or something okay I think I will hedge Germany just have a central hedge could be France could be Denmark could be Romania apparently it should be like right down here think I just go like Poland here Bas Bas Poland and I was in front bro how do you ever go New Zealand on that bro I don't know may the plans at the bottom I but in 10 seconds I had no no there's no way you possibly ever go New Zealand on that like what how does Shor do that it's him bro no like it looks weird but I couldn't place it CU I knew it was in the US but I couldn't think of like something outside of Europe during that time I mean I was in the back is so unusual for New Zealand but like literally look at look down the road everything looks completely different like one like it's like this one random like all right RC song of the [Music] day be careful your ears don't get pregnant ooh so clap your hands and yell hooray song of the day yeah okay song of the day is

Chum there uh as well as everyone else in the East Northeast us I like yeah I like the nanta call out I like this call out I mean snail my goat on Long Island with me oh wait I guessed with water North that's kind of funny but I guess I was hedging here because I thought it was there but these guyses make more logical sense but you could see land so I was confused I should have just guessed that dude I rewatched I literally guessed like right here kind of crazy or right didn't guess but I was about to round four was uh yeah great guess by Oscar and my kind of guess ruined me there everyone getting Brazil there though in round five was just Poland shout out to May potato D and Lenley for getting the city right and in 10 seconds I'll take fifth place and look at this guys just

think it might be Guam can I find Guam on the map East West Road with like water it's like a bridge like this probably this is there water South it does look like there's water South I wonder if it's like are we like right here or we on this bridge if we're on this bridge I'll be upset but wait the I don't think that River lines up I think this one does yeah it was that bridge nice all right off to a good start off to a good start round two let's not throw this away should be like near Vol grad um yeah I think you just have to click Sumer when you have Gen 4 winter coverage Russia I mean I hope this is Russia you should just click Sumer around here that is okay that's fine round three okay [ __ ] what I hate parking lots why is this sign over here filled like I guess I have to go France but it doesn't look like France I thought it was like is it ever Denmark oh it could be Denmark oh I can't commit Denmark now I'm too scared I wasn't going sweet on that I just wasn't okay um Is that West Cali pole ever I'm G to try West Celly was that even a French C okay let's just lock in water West and celly I mean that's kind of everywhere I don't even know where the coverage goes this is a large body of water though like an open I hope this is even C West C if it's not it's skill issue um is there yeah we'll try it sui maybe that was a sui pole I don't know the difference um okay well we started strong we did not end strong Canada what you do here probably not like probably New Brunswick or something I mean I've given up on the seed yeah I mean well we started strong we started very strong I think this uh extender right here the syy right here is uh Su wesi but I saw in Cali I thought they had like the symmetric insulators and so I just click that and uh went Cali because of it you can take a lot of things away from me skewed world is not one of them 10 seconds on the clock lock in everybody has his days everybody makes mistakes Norway or Scotland I'm gonna go Norway here so norish go Max South but just little Hammer okay round two probably Russia we have white flowers you maybe want to go Estonia but need more [Music] Russian people that go ston there are going to get more points and that's infuriating probably South Island that's kind of a good guess I got the road right and then round five is just Switzerland I mean I meant to click the other road but looks like it's something like over here Max East okay um yeah I mean I played that fine that was kind of a boring seed though people that go Estonia get more points where was this new fuel on Flat [Music] Bay be well [Music] it looks like they got a good time going on over there let's see how everyone else does I think this looks like here great call out tough oh this looks like here tough but many people thought that okay oh I fumbled this so bad bro I forgot this looks like what does this look [Music] like I'm a bit confused n this looks like maybe no like the wrong country it's very wrong I just stay here it's okay we we B okay I mean what a nice sight okay the thing is I was already coping bro sure wouldn't be here is it like I don't know I kind of feel like this area here no this doesn't fit with the copyright and the B it's uh frustrating yeah maybe said too much he's going to not trust the copyright now on every round I'm not quite sure on this one I thought here and I don't want to think anymore it's okay I'm third bro how did this guy get third when he was saying tough on every round because I'm just been different my brother uh no this is too much no no no I'm going down okay I'm going up again where that's a good question now wait this like here close one oh my God another one's actually closed here I haven't learned my BS yet wait wait this this though uh we going like here now this is the wrong road again oh my God okay now this one I get though okay uh is it ever no this is wrong no wait let's was right okay okay okay bro and lonstein is crazy but actually did wait spoilers bro I'm sure RC is going to struggle on the around like that okay I actually don't know if this is east or not I don't think it is I just go Kazan in before it's um right here I think we H it was is this this downtown Stockholm like what I'm kind of confused okay it's not not downtown but it was Sweden see water is West that's kind of kind of weird why is the water West I don't know I probably go like here somewhere oh I mean that's yeah fair enough I can't tell if that maybe it's but what is this is like 45 degrees or I just go uh I low you want to go like Valor but I don't think I will it's sofy really really the swed makes so much sense it makes sense in hindsight yeah do you see like the rusted metal on the side that's like a northern Nordic thing you only find yeah like this stuff yeah like you only find like very Northern cities but I this is the most Stockholm building I've ever seen right here sent on this I don't even know where like FR sh hambur yeah I mean looked Northern I was like yeah the susiestyle sui what do you mean bro what I was like no this is never not Central yeah I mean it looks very much like centrala but the Bon I keep coping yeah that's what I'm doing right now he Mom Dad don't know which one of the three it is Norway yeah no actually go Ria is this a base G Sugi it is based but it's pan ID so even further away than you just do it D I can't go down here I can't do that bro like that doesn't look like that side what unfortunately unfortunately you can't do Ocean Drive is here kodc make a song of the day Gucci flipflops and we're have toci flip goes hot oh my God all right okay okay the song of the day is via Dios by cuchis she's Colombian [Music] American there we go all right y all right Zig and you each have five seconds to name a song uh always on time J Ru okay [Music] Kodak what did he say I could come up with anything wait what did he what was what was that German yeah yes I was just speaking of a song that I'm listening to right now okay bro GG's like stay okay let's see how everyone did I think me and Ma are got the 5K here anyone close okay we'll take that uh everyone going Guam though I mean listen the 5K means nothing when you get uh 20 more points you're doing it round two couple people going in my there uh everyone going this region Russia makes sense um this also makes sense but yeah Russia okay any France guessers validation Dusky snail based and oh and Lenley and Eddie good company over there um I like the Ireland guess a lot um in hindsight maybe my Denmark guess would have been better no one going that North at all though but uh well played everyone getting Sweden on that round four was the Sula anyone going Cali okay snail and Lenley again my goats and Ziggy just add absolute goats like just anyone getting close here D great guest Kodiak getting uh good guess gelous we got water hedge lots of see the Wy guesses though round five was newy couple people going all over I'm going quick because Ka is currently playing G on stream it's the biggest content thing I've seen in a while it's I love watching new people play gaser it's a very wholesome experience round one um it's like uh what what can I relate it to it's like when you watch your kid like open presents on like Christmas day cuz like you can see the joy in something new that they have and it's a fun experience um all right gor a great guest there in Norway insanely good guess everyone going scavia round two was just Baltic or it was just people going Baltic get closer like I said Blinky great guess uh really good guess and Eddie great guess by Eddie base guess by Eddie and mackam great good guess around three uh North Mass baller there CA makes sense too it did look like more Croatia uh round four was New

sure if you guys know this or not but today I woke up and I had the privilege to use my Noggin all right round one game one this is like a a US cone right here like traffic cone um look Southern low key is it Southern it looks like it could be Southern dude but it also looks like it could be like Northeast Jersey no not not again what do I want to go I kind of want to go like Louisiana but I also kind of want to go like [ __ ] it we ball dude I thought it could be like something over it's literally just downtown RC's home wait is this the road where they had like the covered street views somewhere down here I thought yeah I think on this road there's like you can see like all four street views or what am I thinking of I have to go back and see if that's like wait what is this is this a Nevada I think you have to go Nevada here um also Nevada Nevada I don't care people only people that care are people from Nevada okay and I don't even know which one's right do I just go like Reno or what do I go like I'm just going go Las Vegas if it's like Reno or something like or like something North so if it's okay seriously that's two horrible us guyses also someone commented on my video yesterday also that's not a Colorado yes it is that's literally a Colorado plate you can see the green on the top someone commented my video yesterday like Rainbow's from the us but he really [ __ ] at the US dude suck my all right round four we can still get 20K points here we're actual goats I mean you have to go like Northern Finland Sweden here not sure yeah round three or last round round five listen I need the points do I just go Luxemburg I think it's 2023 copyright I don't think Luxenberg has 2023 copyright does it I don't know I'm not even GNA try and act like I'm G know that if it if it doesn't I don't think it does but good guess whatever all right so my downfall of the day is uh the USA again in Atlanta like I really hope RC gets this right or I really hope he doesn't for the content honestly I stand by those us guesses like as good guesses 10 seconds on the clock I haven't had a single good 40 second seat this week so I have to lock in round one this looks like BC or like Chile the side of the road here feels more Chilean like down here okay Argentina I don't know just ba Qatar never UAE cope iar in the [Music] map I want to go Bulgaria here if it's Russia so be it please don't be Russia kind of popping off okay hear me out I'm going Panama because I want to be the goat what did I do that bro why did I do that okay us I was kind of getting a southern vibe from this but it's hard to tell yeah I think that might be a Southern Pine over there I'm going to try like a North Carolina maybe because it's not like super Southern go like here was that's kind of annoying it'd be like like here here somewhere maybe that was my thought like here although that might be Gen 4 I don't know this oh wait this road maybe okay it was that road it was the wrong side of order but we will take that back in the US you have a front plate I don't know I kind of thought California but I don't see what else is possible I guess like Colorado I'm going with Cali I just thought it was like Sacramento area or something thing no it was Colorado okay that would probably been my second option it's so hard cuz the trees are far away and I can't really make him out to be honest I was thinking it was pretty far north like the vegetation feels pretty low so I was thinking it's like Northern Finland or something okay it was even more North is it Germany or is it Lux I can't really make out the ballards well yeah I guess I'll go Germany and it should be Northern if it stry something like here oh okay am I closest to they were kind of tough this one I thought about Georgia there's nothing here that says specifically Georgia it kind of looks like Georgia but it's hard I mean Georgia in my book but yeah I mean AEL non area all right I frequent I just cringed from my fifth guess on this round bro but I'm not sure I don't know if I can watch this just to relive that moment it's bad okay let Arch it's kind of just generic so I'll hedge it here okay yeah just downtown Ba OH is the Qatar is UAE I think that's the Qatar flag right there Bulgaria an interesting Bulgaria though okay Brazil I would just go somewhere hedge the Tri point maybe heding Tri Point what's the right move first place let's go wa don't look don't look don't look at my guess yet okay okay okay let's play a game okay you already play a game yeah it's called let's validate Trevor um and jous can help here let look at let's look at I was trying to be fancy I think in hindsight yeah so you probably saw these trees right I mean to be honest brail yeah yeah yeah I know hly Western Kenya yeah I could see Kenya okay it wasn't Kenya the guest is horrible the guest is horri I don't want to talk about it the US colia no no this is humiliation ritual right now this is what we're going you go Thailand right no interesting climate and I saw like the white outer line gen for skewed world you can't see the car and I thought the road looked L a.m. I went Panama where did you go did you go Peru Panama oh Panama that's I just forgot about Panama like the bo there yeah yeah like it's like when you when you say it like I'm like yeah that's that's not that bad of a guess like I could see a Panama here it's just like not the first thing that comes to mind well it wasn't the 19th either so you want to bring the Vibes back up with the song of the day yes [Music] flap your hands and yell s of the Day song of the day is limp by Fiona Apple maybe sh to Fiona Apple you think she's watching all right next day with Ziggy hi Ziggy hi let's get rid of De here what do you think de guest actually let's see like what is he doing okay um round one where'd you go here oh I think I don't think you're on here yet you ocean are there that's validating G de I mean I didn't think this was like I thought it was South but L people went North I don't know no one lo lo the trees look North so no one got Georgia at all sad average US moment col born r three only cons to get Colorado where' you go that's based yeah I mean my first guess was like New Mexico but we had a front plate so I even consider Texas so I mean yeah guess by Eddie run for what was this oh this was the northern uh Finland I think I saw a Ballers here like it's uh like these wait there that yeah okay that makes sense I was like dude this is so weird I was like maybe it's like the Gen free like czechia Hungary winter coverage I went like Hungary I think I mean that's valid yeah there's people in the US too so um yeah guess to Tri turn and bokei the around five was what was this oh Germany I'm in Luxembourg I mean you're closest so yeah true wa actually does does alberg even have 2023 copyright uh I think most of Luxenberg is 23 okay so I guess it's just too flat but um no one got western or like this area I mean it was like slightly hilly you usually don't see that like in that area but all right round one chil uh gor great guys everyone going chilly there C people outside round two ba everyone getting ared kind of boring three shout to people going Qatar honestly or it was a flag I think oh was there I think RC mentioned that too yeah I did not see the flag bulgar I would I would see Russia's are fine guys I think I think I think I tried to look at the plates and it kind of looked like they were just white so I can kind of understand Russia there and especially South down there yeah I mean um great guess there by Dustin 2 on YouTube and everyone else around there I'll do this right today treer gets five I think this my f oh three Lous one I think I gave con an extra point

open the shop or No Deal you know I get every single wait what do I have this unlock I feel like G gives me everything god dude imagine you'd lose a game G and then your opponent hits the grey on you that's kind of crazy all right 10 seconds lock it uh trees trees trees New Zealand is over North Island New Zealand like up here wait I thought I clicked okay okay where is O guessing today is that a stobby that looks like it's a stobby East West Road do you go into the one here or do you go up like up here that's just closer this is not New Jersey this is I think this an Ohio plate so I'll go like something over here come back I mean in theory you know he could have drove from Ohio to London uh what this Austria Austria or like cation no no I don't know okay um I mean it's l Ontario it's like pretty much the US it's like I want to be us but driving in very wealthy Beach town so we mock very beautiful I did recognize that driving in one of the wealthiest towns in America is it really one of the wealthiest towns in America D New Jersey me if J guys are had a Creator code in 2022 it was named the fourth most expensive zip code in New Jersey so it's not really one with the well if it's fourth in New Jersey oh and then 2021 it's the second most expensive in New Jersey and 22 deal was the rank is the most expensive oh dude deal stocks are [ __ ] Rising bro what the hell okay but this like looks like a Black Mirror house like it's pretty cool don't get me wrong like this is definitely where they filmed like a Black Mirror episode all right let's see how every else does why are we like right on the coast is this like Florida or something it's like I don't know am I trolling okay I'm trolling what's the house that's never New Jersey it's tough I think I just go Java okay probably Bulgaria I mean I'm trying to think if anything else is possible I think it's just spook area probably just Sophia no it is s area okay fair enough it's like o um probably go like bris or something no I don't see it but I think it might be this stuff unless I'm trolling is always possible okay yeah I [Music] mean if I expected anyone to know it it would be Eddie and Oscar Jam got first it's here well then yeah I kind of got lucky on the US One how's it ever New Jersey bro like unironically what is that house I thought the house was would look Northern kind of yeah Michigan otherwise I would have got more I didn't even look at this the direction of the coast I feel like I went California I I thought we were like looking at a a great lake or something I don't know wait where' you go you went Michigan yeah I I just knew the palm trees the planted palm trees like de threw that in there for bait so I was just like trying to go with the most counterintuitive thing that's why sense I hungry on that other one Asbury Park I've heard of cuz that's where a lot of people go on like uh tours for music like there's a some venue there and like like they'll do a New York one but they'll also do like an Asbury Park what is this it's like Russia or something I'm confused no it's New Zealand um yeah I mean it's just somewhere North is B guess though low key yeah speaking of New Jersey is this also or am I misreading that plate oh it's onario this probably Poland right here something oh no oh a that makes so much sense yeah to I mean yeah I can see how this one is yeah okay I went ch yeah I thought about as well but I thought that feel right I went Uruguay so yeah you do get those though yeah especially when it's flat like that it's a bit hard for me to distinguish between like

Noggin because I kind of forgot to record the daily today it's 9:45 pm. as I'm recording this right now whoops um I acent just scripted we'll take it round two um okay ballards don't know the ballards looks like obviously the US like is it ever even just like new t or something more North but it looks like Mexico something like Arizona Mexico New Mexico I would be over here but I'm afraid it could be more North this is probably not good either I kind go more North in there like Utah Colorado guys it's just screaming my name I don't think it's that far south we [Music] ball I was literally on the 5K okay whoops all right Argentina North South Road is that the border of something what's this welcome sign here on a North South Road what are we welcoming there's no Bridge so that would really make sense maybe it's like a province we're on like the board of a province or something I don't know what does it look like it looks North I guess wait is this Ser Paraguay Palms in the back hm it's so north south now this is a horrible guess yeah I don't know what I'll have to go I have to go back and look what see what that was um okay well this is interesting because it should be the us but what is this pavement it's like so Texan like this has to be downtown Texas border right right I mean it's round four so we're kind of duee for a round four choke wait is this ever anything besides like I mean this right here is US uh and the Texas pavement is kind of there there's mountains North though which is so freaking weird makes me think it's like over here or something like more south over okay and we get to reaching against Thailand to end it off here okay Urban Thailand okay couple thoughts here not really doable um easy answer is Bangkok second easy answer is Chang M five hit answer is over here in one of these Ean neighborhoods where there's like like nakan rashima where there's like tons of like cities like this that like are deceivingly big I don't think this looks like Bangkok either famous last words but I don't know it's like some random Urban Thailand should have but could have to be fair like it's Western Bangkok so like I'm not really familiar but fine guess all right well I okay what was this it was a border of a province okay I just didn't know what province skillo I mean I did I get State streak right oh it's next to the Four Corners oh my God yeah this is probably GNA be a quicker video today because I I have messed up my whole schedule I'm sorry guys tomorrow it will be better I'll get back on schedule but listen it's better than nothing right I could have just given up round one Russia looks like chel beans or like Eastern Russia near like Omsk we'll take it round two uh okay Philly I guess what is this Brazil yes Brazil um why I think this is Philly okay uh Frick this is probably Philly right no this is col or no Philly devout dude I have no idea I don't go s the Westy there white outer line cacti Mexico North Mexico this is a really hard seed uh Colo like is this Northern Columbia all right sorry I played quick because I don't want to keep RC waiting but um I played fine I don't go Su Wy on that I think I might have seen like a decently day a decent day this video is probably under eight minutes I'm sorry tomorrow is a new day with new guesses okay let's see how everyone else does I thought like turkey here um

way was literally Four Corners that's crazy yeah it kind of feels like no maybe actually don't know this ah cuz it's over here nice Red Road why do I actually not know where this lock is why are the mountains like East West that makes no sense here or something I don't know Texas oh my God I don't know do I just go Bangkok here do I feel like I have to just go here somewhere I don't know okay Chumley let's go almost scripted but uh fortunately chumy was too too good yeah I mean kind of throw on the US unlucky unlucky I thought like pis or something maybe oh man not off to a good start is this like here or something what okay you already beat CH score yeah I guess so yeah oh gosh yeah I don't know no it's Mexico yeah bro what is this it's like col or something maybe okay I can see how

went Kenya that rush around round one similar guess okay true Bas okay that that's about where the similarities end okay we had Brazil as well I mean you got you got inia right too what do we see it was facing the water yeah but this is not the pole I saw probably yeah wait we can see that pole no yeah it was a different it was the metal one that's that's the only reason I went Su yeah same I have to check my uh let me think of something clever uh what's the song of the day very clever [Music] and be careful your ears don't get pregnant ooh so clap your hands and yell hooray it's song of the day [Music] yeah okay song of the day is survival tactics by Joey Badass oh [ __ ] you know that song No I know Joy bad I don't think I've heard this okay you big Joy badass guy or I like that

right day play the game of G and day to wake up with a privilege to use your nogin I mean you have to go to the UK here I guess this housing in the back lowkey feels or like the brick there feels like the UK also it just looks depressing so like that's probably the biggest clue um what else could this be I don't know I'm just going to go like something up here uh yeah I have no better guess maybe slotty more south like near man Manchester is pretty depressing yeah makes sense um okay round two oh Lord please help me get this right okay well it's Indonesia guys I think it's like a golf course in Indonesia like where would you get like this golf course I mean do I just go Bali because is there even a golf course in Bali I mean I don't know there's probably golf courses all over the place but like I just assume like Resort type thing I I don't know okay I mean I probably should I probably could have found that golf course I'm not sure why I guessed it is there a golf course this North no kind skill issue I just wasn't too confident my guess that's okay round three Nigeria you probably just have to go Abuja mean these are Abuja Hills surely right um it's like a bridge a North South Bridge I hope this is a bja I mean I don't think this is a bja now because I do not see anything that makes sense um okay I guess it could be something like this because I I don't see water yeah I think we're over water I don't know I'm just going to guess Aja were we even over water okay we were overw waterer I didn't know if it was like the um yeah that's fine dust is coming from the right grabing right do you go Mexico here the sun South Northern Hemisphere I think you have to go Mexico and do you go near like Monteray um if this ever isn't Mexico it's probably like I don't know what else this would be besides like over here like North Mexico maybe like Argentina or like Northern Peru Peru maybe I could see a crazy Peru if it's just Peru and it's just skill I'm going to go somewhere up here just mon right I'm playing decently well oh no oh no what is this am I going to throw this it looks like a could be like a Africa like Nigeria or Ghana or something I going I wait what is this this is bad yeah I don't know this guys I'm sorry I just don't I'm guess I go g I don't know what this car blur is either like I'm going to go Nigeria actually again but like I have no idea where this is just so wrong this is about to be really embarrassing synal oh man I don't go CLE on that do I go CLE on that I could maybe go I nah I'm okay with my Niger I guess honestly yeah that's a tough uh that's a tough Syle actually is it yeah it's not easy I should have really found this golf course I'm kind of upset about that but that's like three days in a row I've had a pretty decently bad 40 second but then I usually lock in the 10 second so let's let's see if we can do that today my discrepancy in placement is usually pretty large in the two round one hey Bells um do I go Denmar or France or like something like that um I kind of like Denmark more to be honest we'll take it round two it's Bots swana East West Road dry don't know I might go near pocket like this uh BC or like Montana or something like that is it ever Montana or like what you go here I'm worried it could be BC I know some Baltic country Lithuania laia I guess the country right that's okay um blue tractor corn I don't know I'm going like North Mass Seria I have freaking no idea I'll take that Famous Last Words let's see everyone else does what in the okay um where's your map you're playing the fox guesser no bro and I still have no idea if it's Scotland or Ireland TBH it's probably too depressing for Ireland it's like one of these islands what wait why everyone go Island Man on that because it's Gen 2 wait was you see water why is everyone going onland I know that a little concerning I guess I'll just go like downtown Jakarta or something cuz I don't know okay B is this like downtown of bua or except for like huh this actually works uh I mean I don't know okay it was there this is Sparta feel like I have to go like s or something no I think so dude it was Mex what is this like senagal or something I mean this like is Gen 4 but I don't know here somewhere okay I mean you cooked wait did anyone else go Nigeria with me can you check I just need some Val I haven't looked yet looks like there's some low points okay that's validating okay Tor let's go what better company you than Toro what we have D I want to do a thing with d snil where I try and keep them at EV or yeah try to keep them at even Subs I think it' be fun and how I think D's at like just passed him because I gave SN shout out and now I feel bad because D's also posting daily so now I feel I have to give it to D too you gotta all right I'll put I'll put both images on screen here okay your guys is to keep their sub count the exact same so they're equally cool in my eyes and if you see one person above the other unsubscribe no I'm just kidding yes um that's a fun way to they also make good daily content so yeah exactly and the RC one day will make daily content right RC one day dude no way bro why did this why did it show back up bro you know like someone without context of the game will probably definitely think you're a cheater like you have random red boxes on your screen that's not an easy Denmark either I don't feel like I don't know felt like to me I don't know tph okay yeah Francis I thought about it there's a Hope BC and not a c BC I don't think no C BC around here is this ever too hilly for like Lafia cuz I thought it was that okay no it was just wait what is that guess by Jacob okay and goat right here why is that Central what actually misplaced this the most moldovan looking landscape I've ever seen except for this but I don't know where where did I go that I think I went like uh oh I went Serbia I was heding Ser North Mass where did everyone else go didone else not go

let's region guess in the USA or Canada um there's like that thingy at the end of the guard rail there that I feel like I've seen it's not Ontario it could be Quebec if it's that if it's Canada I'm inclin to go us here though but like I don't know where you would go in the US here like it just feels more Canadian to me for some reason not sure why and that was a great guess okay round two okay I mean when you see these uh when you see these trees you have to assuming they're just polish trees I'm making sure they're not polish trees though what else could they be it could be Baltic could be a crazy France I think I just have to go Poland here if it's not Poland it's just kind of a skill issue because I think everyone goes Poland here I'm GNA go Northern Poland though and try and reging guess here a little [Music] bit I'll take that it was Lithuania but it was like like right on the border like in I mean like listen I thought it was Northern Poland and it was Southern Lithuania okay so that's like in hindsight like that's fine this is interesting because we have like these alternating poles right here which you would think would be Bulgaria but there's we're looking at the back of the car and we don't see an antenna it looks like it's Serbia but like have I and where these these polls feel I'm going to go Serbia like [Music] south southern Serbia okay I'm playing pretty good okay and this is where we just get a random like Coast with a factory and like okay Spain crossed my mind for a second I don't think it's Spain though Italy like Frick dude uh we're driving right it looks like yeah I water South like dude I have no idea what to guess here besides Spain I just can't think of anything right now guys I don't even know where this would make sense in Spain like this doesn't make sense I'm just not getting that I'm just not getting that I'm just not and sometimes you know it's okay to to think that all right we have have oil Palms with like the single yellow road line makes me want to go west Cali cuz like usually when you get oil Palms like this you just want to go north santra but like I kind of want a risk one for the bisc it I I thought I could rhyme risk one with biscuit and say risk one bis one I was like that doesn't make any sense but like there's an opportunity there you know um so if this is like smra that's like wait it's not Thailand is it it's Thailand [Music] why did I do that like uh what was my thought process there like why did I do that um all right yeah I I I don't know I I'm not too sure either guys I'm not too sure all right skewed World 10 seconds that was kind of funny more than you think all right 10 seconds lock in it's hude okay um surely you go Germany here uh Belgium sure is this maau or like Hong Kong or something it was maau okay I mean maau like makes sense uh Poland again maybe or like that region France potentially I'm going to go France yeah that's a great guess like I'm kind of like really is this canaries okay and then Southern Brazil wait if this isn't Brazil where do you go here you have to go Brazil here right ever arge like whatever dude that's the second time that's happened to me is it ever arge Southern Brazil I mean yeah I had like I played really well like my Europe region guessing there was look at that I'm SL if I just take my guesses and put them left like proximately 100 kilometers I have a really good day in Europe I'm just my uh my thing is a little off there um that's a great great uh I mean maau is free I'm not sure why I even went Hong Kong there that was a free ma cow and this was just maybe if I have one more second I'm like wait this kind of looks like Argentina but okay to the left to the left to the left to the left to the left tomorrow I'm making a guess and then I'm putting it to the left about 82 kilometers and we might be the best players to ever live yeah this is kind of a free Panhandle Arch to be honest but like there wasn't any drama really like I need some drama in these um yeah nothing going on there that's for damn sure sorry um France don't really care okay let's let's get canaries yeah we had two we missed both Lithuania dude [ __ ] Lithuania what's going on here let's talk [ __ ] on this wannabe pole in trees maybe we can find sabonis in here somewhere let's watch their Lithuanian basketball highlights in 120 good ball movement average European basketball honestly [Music] let's see how everyone else does I thought Ontario Poland could be Russia I guess could be a Baltic yeah I'm going to go Poland here I think okay if I had Baltic that would have been perfect go what is this Bulgarian maybe no pavement is strange gosh this is hard uh Serbia I guess I don't know Mountain North that's kind of weird I don't know I'll just go here okay big Port what is this building it's kind of weird maybe like Poland again and we like G or something or El blog I'm not really sure dude it's lith again I was pulling lith tosses today call or Sumatra I'm leaning Sumatra on this one yeah I'm going to go sumantra I think C yellow line though as as someone once told me I know you want C on this yeah and it was cell Sweden no I don't like Sweden I don't know what it is Belgium maau like here yeah okay Nice France ever galsia something like that Loki it's galsia do I go for it I'll go for it no dude it was France okay canaries uh maybe Lera no it's just like this one oh okay we'll take that Brazil or is it orange wait white line is kind of weird maybe it is Arch yeah I should have clicked okay gz that's fine speaking of top three okay song of the day here com your favorite s be careful your ears don't get PR is at Night by Shakedown at Night by Shakedown it's 7 minutes long though bro yeah but it it gets so good it's like it's

Emily great guess there conas and getting uh getting Lithuania only people getting Lithuania but everyone else going Poland so still getting decent points round three was uh Serbia the Bulgaria makes sense I don't know the pole was interesting because I feel like you usually get the pole in Bulgaria Blinky okay bro round four um Toro I mean yeah I had no idea I mean like I probably should have reasoned something a little bit better there um but uh yeah Blinky going only person getting lethania there and winning by 2,000 points um and then we have uh East Cali thank you one of my maybe more uh not proudest impulse decisions but shout to Blinky all right and then the 10 second yeah let's see what happened here round one was what was round one oh Belgium Luxembourg good call there couple people going Germany Oliver kind of uh you're up there round two was what where was round two maau what was bro doing in Hong Kong um round three was France couple people in US majority that was not easy France canaries who got the island right here only bokei got the island right totic hedging a ton and everyone getting canar though for the most part in round five was Arch paint handle everyone

right it's another day to play the game you guys it's another day to wake up with a privilege to use your nogin round one game one in well looks like estin if there was no estin grass so I'm going to go estin east west road okay ever this I mean I'm just like zooming in the random road for no reason I don't know why I'm acting like that's such a straight East West Road though like what where did you get that long straight road I can't see anything that's like maybe up here I mean that's pretty easy I guess but like what you like and I don't know what this is okay um what is this Brazil why I think this could be like like Brazil I mean what else could what else you go here it looks like there could be like car meta here it's like not ever Africa right I could definitely see this being some random Africa like gen 3 Kenya or something like Western gen 3 Kenya but I just have to go Brazil here because I I it's the obvious answer and if it's something silly like that so be it Philippines didn't cross my mind that's that's just a bad guess you have to have UPS to have downs I guess right uh oh my God there's literally nothing here do you go Mexico or Colo I guess you go Mexico because you have Coke like where else do you get Coke like Mexico loves coke uh and there's like somewhere touristy because there's like people vendors here selling like or like something of value here so I'm just going to go near CD Max if it's Colo and I blunder the seed after that chapas oh that's that makes so much sense that makes a lot of sense actually that makes so much sense this is Philippines I could have maybe thought about that for like 20 more seconds I'm like where is tourist the Mexico um water West in Philippines do I just go Deval like what do I do here is this ever not Philly I can't believe I just went um can't believe just went Brazil and Philippines that's a Gable dude the Philippines just rent free my head today yeah that's the last place for your boy that's for damn sure I just guessed exactly where the other one was cuz I didn't know oh my God Philippines here is actually super Gable listen I mean in order to have highs you have to have lows I think in the 140 days of me doing this series I don't think I've had that many lows but that's okay 140 140 10 seconds on the clock World lock in looks bwan or like Montenegro or something like that I'm g go Monte could be [Music] Catia I'm locked in like I'm just locked in right now um is this over California or is this Europe I'm playing I'm not even playing on 10 seconds dude it wasn't even 10 seconds bro all right 10 seconds now lock it could have been a good game kind of what we needed but that's okay round one pavement looks Turkish something like this yeah um oh no what you do Scotland or like you go the UK here what else you do don't know South Africa probably not oh that makes a lot of sense I'm okay with that though okay this Thailand Bangladesh or the Philippines again the pavement kind of looks tie but I be a red [Music] hering I mean just like learn your pavement you know Canada is this new is this every newy or like where in Canada would this be I'm getting newy here it's kind of risky but like got nothing to lose everything the game Nova Scotia um K Dash outer lines you don't go Sweden here do you you don't go Sweden here do you you have to go Sweden but like we're in Sweden I play that great I played that great I mean this was bad that was a Gable I think I think this I should went Scotland first instinct I I was hedging I guess is man Scotland or something don't know it's okay because you have the games like the first game where it's like yeah rainbow you probably shouldn't be posting this to the internet you know it's like okay well hopefully everyone else makes the same mistakes I do at the end of the day and that's that's that's okay okay what what is this it's like an island up here St dishes next to Holland the thing is I'm just going to Google dishes UK If I want to like learn about it it's going to show me like [ __ ] photos of beans and toast all right let's see how everyone else does this is uh dude I know this road I've seen this road is it this one it's this one all right go maybe I should click on an intersection but yes Thailand Thailand Thailand yeah um here somewhere wait what it was Philly okay I guess the sugarcan makes sense but damn is like Guatemala or something I can't see the car I guess it might just be Mexico please don't be guat dude oh dude it was close to guat oh my God these gu people beat me I'm actually annoyed by that okay what is this what wait what Coast West no I'm actually confused this is so non cynical what is it like Shri it was Shri dude I could have gotten that dude I could have gotten that I should I'm actually so annoyed if I were you I would just like take a deep breath and just like go take a walk for like 5 minutes after that one that's a no one has a no one has a single point on this round everyone North Central okay dude dude Deb beat my score by the way and he went North C Island and like guest like Chad and like four of them oh my God where is this is this like upington maybe like something in this area okay yeah dude I had so any I don't know okay the Philippines I didn't think Philly but the Mexico like I was thinking gu and it was kind of near guat maybe I should have HED like choas or something because that would have made sense yeah this one I mean okay this the house is lowkey looked like Indian or um Bangladesh but I knew it was in Bangladesh so I was like maybe it's tree even though like I've never seen people go this did people go Mexico in this oh yeah I guess I can see per in Columbia a lot oh wow it's a lot of C wa wow that is a lot of Co anyone Philippines all right I saw a Tuk tuck let me see that's the only reason I went Philippines behind that oh dude there is one wait that's free actually turkey ah why is it down there ukuk Ireland hedging okay Thailand this is a right here Canada is that French maybe I don't know um hallucinating yeah no it wasn't okay that makes sense yeah Slovenian dashes Swedish dashes that makes sense wait where did everyone what happened to there in hindsight I can see Philly but yeah it was a fun day you know what's the best way to end fun day with the song of the day song of the [Music] dayap is doorman by slow tie doorman by slow tie are they tie no are they it's actually British are they slow no the song is like the opposite of slow so they're should be called fast britiish I was waiting for the South by laugh track bro now I like sat there like awward as [ __ ] out like what the hell yeah BR just left us let me listen to that actually hey don't look at the scores do I'm play my vide that you usually man let me in the door well I have to change it up do we not did we not say this yeah true oh hi s hi k bro I was laughing in my in my head I was laughing in your head it doesn't count K just okay okay m is not working all right next day did I get last I don't think so yeah okay when in doubt you know I mean okay listen a lot of people got like 10K on this it was not easy let's see how many black lines we have a lot okay round one anyone in Brazil wait round one oh this is Esa okay let's call the people that got the rad here um Blinky RC Mack game the 5K ocean man who's M potato and Jami everyone getting astini and Deb is guessing Okay I think DeBry beat me by the way yeah DeBry beat me and I mean he knows where the location okay my alarm went off okay round two Philippines lots of people getting Philippines couple Thailand guessers Saudi Arabia there also shout out to everyone in Brazil also but mainly shout out to people in the Philippines playing pierce the goat round three was Mexico my great guess in Tabasco V chapas Buzzy and Jamal be gting that everyone couple people in Mexico couple people what just happened in Asia uh yeah round four was no one got Tre Lo dude if RC if RC just like had one more second bro oh my God easy first place um but yeah no one got that right so that's validating um and I'm the only one in the Philippines I I saw Tuk tuck I saw Tuk tuck it looked like it could be Philippines I maybe I'm the only one that got the right Asia Vibes you know maybe it's a skill issue Peru makes sense because Tuk tucks Mexico maybe like down there I don't know bro I don't know round five was just South Africa upington I think yeah I mean this I gave up at this point so go um 10 seconds I got second on this one though okay 22 people playing this round one turkey nipped insane Guess m right there round two was okay everyone's getting this that's actually impressive snail bro snil knows his the UK knows UK Blinky G get too uh Finn and trior also getting the northern Island Vibes but everyone in the UK for the most part round three was oh was this tight like Eastern Thailand yeah RC and Blinky great guest with bag over there um great great gu my alarm run off again oh I just pressed snooze um yeah Bangladesh Indonesia also make sense round four was Nova Scotia okay ocean man totic and Jami and Blinky and consis and Finbar and trick are getting that to back play in like two seconds again do they where his bag oh he's in third place why they even why did they Zoom down that far yeah he played in 22 seconds and that mean that guess makes sense round five Sweden yeah France makes sense Spain makes sense Romania makes sense with the dash lines I guess yeah I like Oscar's guess low key because of how like hilly it was like I don't know don't know yeah I'm not a a very very fun day I I I would say this is probably one of the most fun days I've had in a while when it comes to like using your Noggin you know for sure all right zigzag get six here south by I forc South by to play with seed after because I was like bro can you like play in like or am I just like bad and he's like okay I'll play it and then

right it's another day to play the game with youer it's it's another day to wake up with the privilege to use your Noggin and personally me I cannot wait to use my Noggin today I'm feeling like it's a good Noggin day to use round one East West Road in southern Argentina I think it'd be Max South low key like lowy don't think it be here these Hills are kind of maybe it could be like something like that this is probably a white road though no I mean this looks is every just the Chile side though low key or is it like this road let's analyze there's Mountain's North too I'm just going to stay here because I don't know it was that road nice round two looks like standard B uh like uh they're called but this look like B roofs probably UB right probably right um let's think though yeah I'm gu it's probably somewhere in this area oh just d d Pasar okay okay round three there's three flags there that I don't recognize I can't really see any of them oh my God you guys are probably getting such nin I mean it's Europe right this is impossible um yeah guys um I thought it could be like Denmark or Netherlands low key but there's like Hills over there like is it over the UK or Ireland I have no idea what to guess I have no idea what to guess here like at all dude it was a Netherlands that's not Hills that's Shadows um that was really easy actually in hindsight I just was a silly goose okay well this is not easy it's literally just a random Park classic ABW experience okay let's guess a park shall we France Poland France the UK France Slovenia Austria France yeah I why like why am I even trying it's not like even this is like even like yeah I mean what should be the UK I'm just going to go ahead and go to the UK I don't really care wow okay this is this is oddly weird I mean you would think this is just Brazil right but these Center Road lines look like it could be like okay wait wait wait I'm so these don't look like Brazilian Road lines they look like I thought like Hawaii or like something but I have to just go Brazil if it's like Mexico color or something too that's sad okay it was just okay that was almost I don't know why I thought that was Hawaii for the longest time but I played that extremely well besides that freaking Netherlands bro dude that would have been such a like free win today because I played this so well oh I'm going to cope in the Netherlands so hard right now I'm about to cope all over the place oh my God could you see the yellow in that plate right there dude I need to buy a new monitor [Laughter] I'm cing way too hard what even is this din Dina hav't you been Paradise for nature lovers yeah I'm sorry I'm sure I'm sure they have like good seals and fishing and you know Seafood so it was kind of a story for no reason yeah sure the thing is this just like such a free Netherlands I don't know why I like just there's a freaking bike path here and I I didn't go Netherlands like you're telling me the points I lose the most are in the freaking never mind never mind cope cope cope your boat cope it down the street 10 seconds on the clock lock in 10 seconds skew world this is where it matters round one you see a man playing basketball goal you have to assume that's just influence from Slovenia shout out to the goat Iceland water South it looks super flat I'm going to Ric there's not that flat that's okay collect capital good guess round three looks like Serbia or North Macedonia shout to the cal um I'm going north Mass Albania okay so be it you have Japan yeah I'm going Tokyo because I'm a coward cowards never win looks like this area um I'm doing one more that was so boring I want to go wrong continent like I'm sorry that was just too boring give me like a good one okay this is what we like to see this is South Island though surely okay This Way South load load Rwanda what a crazy location what the heck um this is probably North Saba nice okay dude is this Loki Queensland or like what is this Brazil Sagal Nock North South Road I I just went wrong C I think yes you saw me place it you saw me place it you know I don't even care I'll send that one cuz it's probably more fun of a seed I had a pretty good day like but I feel like that was still too easy but I feel like when you play skewed world like the goals for like the the first place to be like 10,000 points and like the locations this is like over here in UAE somewhere have just been too easy you know it's like like this is what we want like did you go like Europe or us on this like Austria or BC I think these rocks in the back feel more like European Bulgaria I don't go you could lowkey go Texas here I think or like Mississippi or something I'm going to go Texas feel like it' be like Florida or something though I'm just bad at this game like straight up that was just more this curo Southern Russia n wow my region guess in the US was freaking horrible the rest was pretty easy okay that was a good seed I think that was a really good seed to it had some ones you had to use your Noggin on L Ohio W this looks so Southern to me like what Woodville Ohio is this account dedicated to sirens that's the coolest thing I think I've ever seen warning sirens of mishana hot garbage will and 2806 72 comments oh my God there's like all the siren Community is in the comments you guys should record Another asct 1228 there are four sirens in this town dude I love finding like small Niche communities like this on the internet X two ASC like can we get one of these guys on to do siren guessing instead of geog guessing Woodville the city with zero bathrooms disappointing Town even more disappointing siren might as well just bulldoze the entire Place based as someone who is now resident of Toledo Woodville can go pound sand and you are so right about the bathroom thing ELO everyone's hitting on Woodville in the comments that's what we'd like to see what goes on in Woodville let's see I mean this looks like speed trap Diner 4.4 stars is pretty good though did they put hot Cheeto fries in their burger bro wait this place looks sick though what the [ __ ] wait bro this is a Vibe wait this place okay no they're valid this place is valid like as [ __ ] bro JoJo's nightclub looks about right let's see how everyone else does I did I did 10 second first whoops switching it up on us today whoops okay should I switch to the other no no no bro locking this is W retention okay okay okay I'm going to try Italy here I read it okay I thought about Bulgaria yeah Missouri maybe Ah that's tough oh gosh um is this like Dr oh no it was Cur out bro I thought Cur out well there you go I did the Dr on Cur out like oh I did the same thing yeah I said that yeah yeah all right okay okay TI Foo and it's like one of these roads here this one wait it wasn't ter B very interesting what is this what is it just like the Netherlands or something like I don't know if any okay it was in there oh it's on this bridge that totally makes sense yeah okay uh I mean Road feels polish but it's kind of weird so many benches I try no uh yeah I don't know I kind of my first thought was ping so yeah I mean could be like a France ch Netherlands again maybe I don't know UK okay I don't know it feels like downtown igas again but I don't think it Loki feels like here Sala okay AG or not Min okay Frank the hunk on top though um I went DeMark in Netherlands though so oh that's funny speaking of goats [Music] [Music] today's song of the day mhm is 400 a.m. by teko onuki I've like dabbled in some Japanese music like City pop

I threw I would I how many points I lose by I lost by what 600 points about and so I would have had again 40200 yeah that would been Hey listen that's how the cookie crumbles sometimes not sure why I overthought that I did get this though so that's impressive I'm happy with this honestly the benches gave it away I was like where would you get benches like this I feel like it's very British to have tons of benches Gorka consis myself trior mackam ocean man Vay and Blinky getting the UK all over Europe round five Axel and Singas and then on the 10 second um 21 people playing jhb unfortunately tomorrow is a new day round one let's look at it UAE everyone getting that round two is Bulgaria Gorka wait dude Gorka won by 3,000 points it's kind of insane it's kind of very insane Gorka and Jami

okay it was South okay round two we have Thailand here on the river you might looky go Bangkok here we have snake traps though these snake traps are found usually like Southern peninsula well you can find them up here you can find them like here in this region too in like in the peninsula but like this looks more Peninsula like I'm going to go chumon or like if it's not it's not PNA or saratani it could be more North actually we'll see I can't see okay this looks Dutch making sure it's not dimark because this sign looks weird but there's a bike path why does that sign look so weird okay it's just NE lens I'm not sure why I'm freaking out okay okay this looks like it's gonna be Borneo like Salk when you have the uh the size of their street is modowe that means you're going to be in sah walk on probably one of these Yellow Roads it's a real meta it's a real meta okay wait is it ever like inalia or Waters West with a Skyline what Skyline is that when Skyline is that is it ever even like over here wa the water's South yeah I mean I don't know okay that's fine 2K that was fine a very very easy seed though so like everyone's going to do well this would be like a 24K seed for someone for sure for sure I didn't really make any good guesses to be honest um um yeah I mean kind of a boring seed but hopefully it was still fun but hopefully SC world can uh have a good lock for

right C Day play the game you it's day to wake up with the privilege to use your nogin round one game one and oh my god dude okay I have progress mentally I'm committing to L on I'm a nort and if I'm right so be it that is not poor it's Peru so be it okay well it was the Philippines but how do you not how like how do you go Southern like okay what do you do here I lowkey just want to go like me tuck it I have no idea you know like it feels like it could be here looks like a little place to I don't know it's probably not actually at all is ever this road actually nope okay it was just the Hamptons that's like it's like not that bad of a guess though in hindsight maybe getting Hampton there is pretty standard but I think my guess makes sense just like you know logistically what a beautiful location okay Scotland water South yeah oh my God my headphones got stuck edin bro uh yeah I have no idea looks like a beach wait is this is this the coast wait what no there's wait this is a cool like tunnel too like respect for not getting rid of that wait what I just not noticed that yeah I have no no idea where to guess here and Northern Ireland okay are you serious where was it you guys remember you guys this is a repeat we've had before where was it I think it was like Central I have to remember somewhere over here it was Western Java bro okay uh Spain will the S be silent no that's kind of sucks with the the repeat I'll do one more game because we had a repeat in the last one but my only goal is to have a faster score or faster time than bag who usually finishes in like 23 seconds so I'll lock in okay decent I'm happy with that 17 seconds there's no way he beat 17 seconds we'll see what my score is against everyone else too I mean I was just space plonking and trying to get within two three seconds of every round um this one I was confused on I thought it was Texas what was it Utah it was it getable Wyoming it was Wyoming okay h i don't go Wyoming here I don't know if my Texas guess is good to be honest but I just S I saw mcmansions you know I just sent you know Texas that was fun I don't think bag he I mean he has no idea what I'm doing but I'll take the I'll take the 17K in 17 seconds oh that's actually kind of funny 17K in 17 seconds and we had a a Florida there all right could have been worse could have been worse what was this city saing sabring Sebring maybe we'll look into that after this but did I you see a Publix oh my God I miss Publix so much oh my God okay 10 seconds lock in oh my God Publix is so good okay uh Peru is the only thing I can think of here Peru I have no idea okay bro uh Baltic I mean random Europe Spain Hungary czechia don't know Estonia it looked Baltic but I didn't really know it like chatau onic wait I mean I don't know where that is okay uh what is this Spain or something ah freck Greece oh wait did I low key use 5K whoops okay um yeah I fumbled the round four Athens okay let me think about this that was not the year was it it was this yeah I mean Spain's a fine guess here I think honestly uh Miss I mean dud it's just Europe dude I suck like look look at everything else Europe like actually no one like literally like I'm going to Google sabring Florida and see what we get okay I do not wish I read some of those articles in sabring okay that will probably be the last time I do any Deep dive on Florida men cuz that okay all right that was a fun day all around I would say let's see how every else does somewhere Central Brazil maybe like goas could be like a piranha as so but I go okay so PA houses kind of remind me of like maybe Denver or something not sure here yeah I mean I feel like it's something generally a little more Western but I'm not sure what okay Evanson that's kind of tough doesn't look too far north or south so we'll go here okay lots of pin here I guess probably just Java then somewhere not too far from s or from charta probably let just go here oh and then I think this is like Texas near the Mexican border I don't know here oh it was Mexico okay Peru I'm not really sure where I probably just headed like here okay maybe like a Sweden or something I don't know no one guys still near there I mean that's impossible yeah that's yeah chatau on the green got to be like here somewhere maybe okay bro okay nice not sure what country this is like Austria of Vienna dude I can't even [ __ ] Zoom okay okay I'm so validating that no one could read that Greek there like okay yeah I didn't I thought it was Spain I'm not going lie all right still first though no you haven't switch on friends still no oh yeah I'll switch after uh I don't know like here somewhere oh I had like the five before let's see first I am surprised I mean everyone went Spain when you went Austria that was the problem yeah you're austri looky clutched a austri clutched at all I mean yeah it doesn't really look like a not really I think you saw the blue thing or like oh Vienna yeah like what is this though like I've never seen this in Spain oh yeah have green yeah it didn't look Spanish I don't know where where' you guys I guess mrid with you okay yeah felt like a good guess to me all right well speaking of [ __ ] I can't think of anything speaking of yeah it's all good speaking of song of the day all right uh song of day for today is polymorphing by chairlift bro this guy just pulls out Cher yeah Caroline I'm listen yeah it's heavy base okay nice little pop do they have any songs on Tik Tok that I would know probably not all right GG's geez but would you look at that it's the next day and oh my goodness gracious fat snail save the snail my teammate is on the top it's in their day also guys shout out to fat snail on YouTube Save the snail I'll give a shout out he is he he uploads daily on the grind and they're funny videos on ironically probably the only J videos I watch game one round one Brazil um I went piranha a couple people in piranha it was just not panha round two was so like City or like outside Evon and we have Toro and let me see if I selected run de I'll keep de score in here Toro and Oscar in Salt Lake City we have over the US anyone okay trout out to mackam yeah I mean that says a lot right here I mean this was pretty impossible where did RC guys I forgot oh he went in Denver he was in Denver yeah Lenley and RC were in Denver yeah I mean all over the place I actually like the Calgary shout like a lot yeah three people in Calgary I like that a lot all right round three was Florida boring round four Indo myth over here by himself okay all over Asia or all over Indonesia there de is a funny guy bro a fun guy okay and round five was oh the Mexico one northern Mexico yeah what did I get I got 13th wait to back play I don't think bag's played I did all that for nothing bro well if bag did play maybe it would have been it would have been in under a over 17 seconds Co that was fun I wish I could do those more often the thing is like that's how I usually play the game but like I can't make the videos two minutes long you know you have to be methodical and educate your guest a little more for the videos all right and then 10 second RC andorka totic where did I place here jhb is back I think yeah I got 18th here okay it'd be like that sometimes it'd be like that I forgot what happened everyone G Peru yeah I mean there's really nowhere else you would go here um besides in the middle of the Amazon maybe round two dude okay I just rewatched back as I was eding this I called Baltic immediately this is why if I was just guessing in 3 seconds maybe I get that right you know cuz like in the first exact second I go maltic and no one went btic on that so I guess yeah I mean everyone went around it that's kind of crazy round three was Chet to in the green Blinky RC getting great guys here trior ocean man and Gorka a lot of people along the river there on the green CTO on the green round four was Greece Cora that won him the game right there that won him the game get Athens on that no one else getting Greece everyone else going Spain and RC getting second place in Austria um and totic this comes down the top three scores

right it's another day to play the game as Jer and it's another day to wake up with the privilege to use your freaking nogin balce world round one game one let's lock in all right this will be Indonesia I'm gonna go W here south Sula is my best guess or I mean South Cali um okay this is not easy this is not easy at all what am I looking at what am I looking at what am I looking at what am I looking at Peru Chile Peru do not choke this okay this is East West Road in Argentina that looks like it's like ba is it ever more North I don't think so I cannot choke this that was a really good guess I think I cannot choke this I cannot choke this I am rainbolt I do not choke ever in this series I make good guesses at all times even Under [Music] Pressure round four turkey surely um if this is not turkey what is this um wait is this South Africa no wait bro what am I looking at this Mexico Oh my God it's Mexico that was almost really bad guys sometimes you have to like talk yourself through something I think this is Mexico sometimes you have to talk yourself through something to get there in the end and let's find this road no just on the port all right that was good for the first time in a long time I had a good ABW seed and I played well bro if this is in the lock this is a harder lock cuz here you like where do you go here with the yellow I guess no maybe that is easier because then you know it's a park and probably Chile because of that CU where else do you get Triple yellow like that and hindsight like where else do you really guess here though like it's this dry I I was thinking UAE but like this building over here like this these buildings right here did not look they look more South American a good game day keeps the doctor away excuse world let's lock in here cuz this is where it matters the most 10 seconds hopefully I can play up to par again okay round one this is Chile southern Chile it's an East West grid I'm going to go [Music] chibo okay this is not easy I want to go Ghana is this ever like campala or something I have to guess if it's campala no it's gone okay I thought I could have been Cala I'm pulling out of my mind today like okay this is Indonesia right it's not Malaysia right I go samantra I guess ah it was Malaysia I threw this is Dr or Mexico I'm going Dr here okay I guess the mountains yeah I don't know why went Greek I [Music] guess what I mess up on uh yeah I went Malaysia or I went into the thing is I think there's a Malaysian plate I didn't look at too yeah there is it happens yeah I mean I had a pretty good day today I would say all around I this is a really bad guess like I will probably be the only one here because you can see the massive mountains I don't see I don't like that's just a horrible guess um but like it's only 400 points so 300 I'm curious what goes on here though like what is this like it's in the middle of absolutely nowhere salt found another site talking about that specific mine and Northern chill or the same one Northern chill was facing an environmental problem as the old discharge luminaries were causing seabirds to fly into existing structures and get killed the artificial lighting with an excess amount of blue light you should have used blue light glasses kind of a skill issue to find oh so this is like a site that or like a a company that makes LED lights or like lights for people yeah oh public lighting well that's cool that's like something I always think about is like you ever just like look at something like I always like I went to like 7-Eleven right to go buy like trash trash bags I'm like we ever invented this trash bag as like or like this brand of trash bags in like this 7-Eleven in Thailand is like a multi-millionaire there's so many opportunities to do things cool out there that you can like find like where you fit in the world it's kind of interesting oh that's cool that they made it safer for seabirds and workers and they saved 60% Energy savings well shout out to ledil 2005 was probably like a smaller operation or something different but they had like no Road connecting it they were like over here at that point wait and they built a road the street view was in 2012 so that must have been right when they added the road because 2010 it didn't 2010 I didn't have a road has it gotten any bigger today not really pretty interesting all right um so we have some Sumatra Pals here quite a few of them actually I could see this being Sumatra yeah I mean the other thought would be C Central Cali maybe South Cali I do kind of like I don't know dude I'm so on the fence about this one something about it is more Cali to be honest should I go I'm going oh dude like you just edged the whole entire like audience it's like Chile or Peru or something I don't know where in Peru is what even is going on here like what what is this what is happening here it's like salt mine or something I might just go border like it could literally be takna so you know what I'm gonna go TNA okay I mean yeah I was thinking like corenas maybe um might just be the main road over here somewhere that would probably check out okay it wasn't corus but pretty close I don't know okay some interesting pavement some interesting rock walls as well I don't think it's swaka I could see let's see we do have prickly pair maybe I don't know it's it's not too far from cdmx anyways it's somewhere in this General vicinity I think over here so I'm just going to go for this and we'll see okay no it was a little more this way I guess okay maybe pavement fits more for Kera this is kind of a boring end to the seed not going to lie where is this Skyline cuz it's not the main part of the city it's a different area it's not no it's not sh I don't know like here it doesn't really make sense but I don't know oh this makes so much sense okay cuz we were so close to the skyline like I wasn't really sure where it made sense but that checks okay this is like South Arch somewhere of chup maybe is my first thought okay nice look at this holding hands all right [Music] Ghana uh yeah it should just be somewhere pretty Central over here Malaysia we have I think like bins might be around here if I'm not mistaken oh no it's like the northern ones okay or it's like West Coast at Le Dr it's like over here Greece I think yeah Greece looks Northern could just um oh yeah I was like uh maybe not actually okay another second place that was winnable actually if I just went like Central gree that was a fun I mean pretty e skewed seed though I would say pretty standard pretty stand things considered you know what is also not standard my song of the day always got switch up you know song of the day pregnant ooh so clap your hands and yell hooray it's R's song of the [Music] day song of the day is a long walk by Jill Scott A Long Walk very RC very imagine you listening to this makes me happy um do I know any of Joe Scott's songs let's see probably not daydreaming maybe wait I definitely heard this oh no the the Tik Tok got her too no oh yeah that's all over T my Tik Tok GG all right it's next day let's see how I did I got eighth place not bad out of 21 round one was Cali lots of people getting Cali there good guesses couple at Malaysia we'll take that round two will bring us to Chile K is great guess here um I'm pretty close there everyone's in Bolivia Peru any UAE guessers okay Jordan maku yeah not easy not easy at all in my opinion round three will bring us to I mean RC's just up here by himself up there but most people going kind of more south round four was Mexico I just rewatched this as I was editing it back where it's so cringe thinking me watching thinking it was Turkey in South Africa sometimes it takes a couple seconds to get to your resistances though and that's okay it's not about how you start it's about how you finish great guess by contest once again I'm assuming he got first he did by 30 points okay and the round five was I think this was to Hong Kong and let's see if anyone get the 5K here no one quite got there but tricker Finn and Blinky getting the Port Road so congrats to them that's my freaking teammate round one was how many people 20 people finishing this one chw boot four people getting five people getting chw boot close um everyone getting Argentina though pretty standard AR this was thank you Axel for Ving the campala couple people all over Asia there couple guat things like that um G um this was a horrible guess how do I go Malaysia on that or Indonesia don't even ask um also I think those roofs like over the whatever yeah thank you totic um but yeah it's just this Northern there I think Mexico yeah yeah all over they're five how do I go Indonesia on that conest getting seven Blinky getting two and trior getting one and 10 second we got D getting two Oscar getting five and gor getting one and I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

Spain going into Endor but was close enough um this is not easy I mean with the rock walls you have to presume this is just like the UK what else could this be Ireland maybe France I could see a France here um I'm gonna go to the UK if it's not the UK that's okay Ireland okay so be it these are chome trees I'm just going to go I think this could be like lowy down by Naples though there's water North with are we like here I mean that would make sense but like obviously there's a lot of water North no that does not make sense something down here I it's definitely Italy somewhere by Rome that make sense no [Music] okay that is fine closer to Rome oh no okay gen two immediately makes me think France but this architecture does not feel French I think you have to go France though what else do you do here I I think you have to go France if it's like something else it's cringe yeah okay is this BC or is this what is this what Canadian town is this is ever like lowkey like Eastern like near no definely BC wait why is there like an Ontario pole here isn't on Ontario lamp I am conflicted at the wazu right now I am conflicted out the wazu I don't like this timer oh my God okay oh

here oh yes let's go okay bro like scripting on the end door is just a weird thing to do like uh maybe Denmark I mean Sweden's possible as well but if it's Sweden it's like right over the Border yeah I mean I didn't think UK or Ireland really though Mark like copen I was Ireland water and then a mountain there it's kind of weird I don't know what what that would make sense for yeah I kind of want to go up here but okay no was just Naples area all right France I guess um it's like Canada somewhere it's not here but even more North okay kir this is like Narin I think somewhere around here okay why did I think like St Louis St Louis BR Missouri okay we'll take that base gu don't know is that a maybe a true Goku play no it's not it's just a Content don't know maybe nmk or Serbia or was nmk I

listen tell me tell me that's not the exact same it's not even the same key I don't know I mean give a little bit you've definitely heard oh of course yeah what's this one oh wait have you heard this song I wait yeah of course of course Super [ __ ] are really underrated like they have so many good songs but people haven't really heard of them that much yeah this is a banger absolute B maybe the top one song in the day ever or at least bandwise all right it's the next day let's see how everyone did round one game one balanced World consis getting first place with 22,000 points 700 winning by 600 round one was Endora I like the people that went right outside Endora thinking it was Spain based Finn and RC both getting the 5K round two let's keep it going which was the Ireland Finn Irish man getting closest there that's always a good sign wait this is lowkey the snail meta SN where did Snow Play this I don't think so um but yeah I couple UK Lots in Ireland actually a couple Denmark and Sweden I don't know that's a lot of people in the UK for me I don't know it wasn't easy or in Ireland did anyone of course blanky found the the city okay Lots people over here near Naples all over Italy everyone is getting Italy I forgot to send the link to jhb so and Blinky how did Blinky not win this round five I forgot what round five was but that was insane oh Vancouver Island a lot of people on Vancouver Island and all over like Washington um based oh Juno that makes sense F four people on Juno there that makes a lot of sense actually 10 second lots of 23 K here round one was this kir road Shadow to snail aiman RC totic and Blinky for getting that right and gka I think a little farther down there but solid round two what was this what was round two oh the Sagle yeah getting the northern Vibes here a couple of us everyone getting Syle though Japan Tokyo boring and then round four was North Macedonia everyone gting that I saw the Ballard and then round five was Italy and I said on block and I was too too busy reading the pizzeria but everyone going Northern ILY there so that's a good sign and rs or GC getting the exact city right so shout out to him con getting four Jami getting two and Linley getting one and then the 10 second we got Oscar getting three aen getting two and oh I got one okay that's helpful and I'll see you guys ", "locations": [{"round": 1,

right it's another day to wake up and play the game with you sir and it's another day to wake up with the privilege to use your freaking Noggin hopefully everyone's ready to use your Noggin today why because I am because I'm about to get actually I want everyone to comment down below what's one way you use your nogin today for me personally it's guessing Florida right no there's actually no front plates wait does Florida use front I don't think Florida uses front plates this looks like one of those like really rich Florida neighborhoods where like like they go film like the what you do for living Tik toks you know this this is what this feels like um sir driving them McLaren what what do you do for Li me where is it like Palm Beach or some [ __ ] like is that one of those neighborhoods is can someone from Florida let me know if the villages that sounds like somewhere where like you're rich and retire you know like I've definitely seen this in the background of like that oh my God if you have freaking golf carts like actually like that's how you know that's how you know right there let's get they're in their golf cart still that guy net worth at least 10 million like minimum minimum this guy he has LED lights on his golf cart that's like minimum 15 mil wait this whole city is just using golf carts I know there's a city in like uh is this is this like is this just like out of my tax bracket to like not understand that this is like a thing people do I know there's a city in Georgia that uses golf carts um because Tom Scott and RC talked about it but well that makes a lot of sense okay r to load in is this Russia I mean this is not easy at all this is not easy at all this like center block here looks Russian to me I don't know though not very easy yeah I don't know I'm going to go Russia here but I don't really know where in Russia like you would get like a road like this I mean the obvious answer is Eastern Russia right but do I go Eastern Russia here I don't think I do like it would be somewhere like over there like it's not I don't know this is probably a bad guess I it was just literally b c like well it wasn't but it was like next to it that's 300 points down the drain okay Texas this ain't TX okay I'm going to region guess Texas once for my life and it's going to be somewhat decent watch these are Texas pavement by the way with like the speckled pavement and it's also like lowkey fake meta but like the wide out lines is like also a Texas thing but you get them like everywhere okay let's think I cannot believe that was just Lake by call dude [ __ ] dude okay is this course I want to go here is this just like Southern France though or is this ever not even France this house looky looks like mainly in franch France but I already lost the seed by quite a bit so we have to risk it for the biscuit I think okay was course this ain't Texas oh my god dude we're just region guessing the us today kind of a based seed okay let's go Montana here surely again or Colorado what do we do here what do we do here I mean it lowkey looks like the album cover you know like in Wyoming yeah I'm G to go there I'm just going go Wyoming because it's hedging Montana and Colorado and it was just Colorado well I mean it was a fine day in hindsight I had like somewhat good Rion guesses I mean it was easy it just kind of comes down to who gets Lake here why did I go west here I should just went East I'm kind of a silly goose for that it's a very cool Lake though I would cope but I'm having a good day today so I'm not going to cope but let's switch it up shall we I need to not cope on that because I need to save my cope because we're uh switching from Terminus 10 second to skew World 10 seconds this map is designed to be played using the no move pan or Zoom game mode 70,000 locations randomly selected by AI with the camera position said plus 90° minus 90° so basically it's everything is away from a road it's all to the side of the road all right 10 second turn 10 seconds SC World lock in don't cope but use your nogin round one bot swana with overcast is this this road over [Music] here okay next one I don't know this I don't know this field at all it's going to be somewhere in Europe obviously I think it could be Ukraine check yeah I have to just click somewhere Central Europe Russia getable this one's Russia but this one looks like Eastern Russia like uh s Sur it's here right okay okay uh bro bro bro this this is Alaska I mean it was Alaska I just couldn't think of a port you know I just had to go to the first Port did I even click on the port I tried to uh that's tough that's tough to like I wanted to lowkey go south but like in 10 seconds is hard to commit that state Circ is fine though we just lost too many points for that oh no okay uh it's definitely like oh Lord Croatia s oh man Serbia oh dude check don't check there okay not bad I would say I was his facing like that that's a g that's a Gable Russia I think for sure this is a cool lock though it's a really based location that's uh the seon capital of the world that's pretty cool all right I think a skewed world is going to bring a lot of really fun moments um I have to work on my skewed Europe though that's kind of moral to story I feel like I did good elsewhere um but I had a couple silly guesses I want to do one more though to see how consistent I am at this or if it's like something I really need to work on sorry I'm concentrating here so far so good is that Romanian or what is this it's not Russia is it okay well this is somewhat decent oh what is this [ __ ] I'm GNA do one more to make sure that wasn't a fluke that was probably a fluke yeah this like I get this wrong it's like Indo Cambo oh Cambo is lowkey Gable that oh Lord okay let's think um I mean this is okay it was a flute guys okay yeah I mean Norway is actually fine there this is back in New Zealand oh it's a treer like what it was just s Marino I was just hedging outside all right um okay this was Gable Cambo all right but this is like something I think I it may be decent at I hope I can probably compete yeah this is a kind of an easy camoo I think all right well this will be a fun kind of see a a fun new series or new what's it what's the word new challenge or way to like differentiate day by day because sometimes you keep doing the same thing things get still you know so having fun Maps like this that kind of cork things up are fun but uh let's see how everyone else does okay Florida um I'm trying to think if I know this I mean I don't but it kind of reminded me of like like PCV area like uh Rosemary Beach or something like Rosemary Beach is different but like I think it's somewhere around here maybe but it could be a different part of Florida I don't know we'll see okay yeah it was oh it's the villages okay I hope you did a deep dive into the villages there's some uh interesting stuff going on there okay wait wait let's talk about it because I didn't do a deep dive but click the lock and went around and all I saw was a [ __ ] ton of golf carts it's like a retirement community basically oh um but I've heard a lot of weird stories about the retirees there you know yeah I mean I should probably hedged more centrally kind sure I don't know it doesn't look like a place I want to go to be honest um it's a really cool like Lake I don't know if it's actually a lake though I was thinking I was wondering if it's like uh this road ever but I feel like the uh actually maybe it's like here that was like my first thought I don't really have okay I mean we'll take that it was actually a smaller L Texas you know CL classic Texas right here with the infrastructure um let's see STV yeah I don't know oh [ __ ] it was down there okay did not really get Southern five but I can see it is this Corsica or is it Mainland France maybe the mountains aren't quite like steep enough for corica think I'll just go here somewhere ah it's like some yeah this peninsula I'm surprised we couldn't see the coast dude this was a base seed I knew you I got this SE I was like love this snow is interesting I'm trying to think like where where you would get this like snowy cover bridge mountains are to our East um I mean it feels like Wyoming or Montana I was thinking like maybe this or something somewhere in this general area is probably fine what Happ Colorado the moment we've been waiting for skewed 10 seconds I'm like blurred as [ __ ] right now oh my God I'm actually two pixels I don't want to turn light on guys I'm too you got to do the finger in front of the camera okay swana uh try to think where maybe like here thisa no it's out there thought the soil was wrong but I guess not Russia i' would say like somewhere over here okay pretty good would say also Russia probably Stan okay again one of the Alaskan towns I don't actually know which one this is though okay it was catch can nice damn guess there okay and I thought Poland yeah oh check yeah okay song of the day song of the day are your ears pregnant today um song of the day is Flag Pole s by Harvey Danger flag pole sitter do you know that s like a with an a can I listen to it real quick sure 120 million plays I hopefully I've heard this [Music] 1997 [Music] yeah dude this The Sounds fire I haven't heard it though how have I not heard this if we want to make like a play yeah I'm sure someone can go through it we've only had like six of these so they can go through at the yeah all right all right GG's all right it's next day let's see how we did 19th Place it's okay to have good days you have to have bad days I want to insert the video of snail and snail's latest video [Music] here okay um d The Villages that's my American goat D has definitely been to the Villages and sits there and buys $400 wine okay I'm just kidding um a lot people getting Florida I'm getting South um Blinky as always great guess Blinky trior great guess yeah round two okay there's a couple people West that's validating wasn't that West but uh yeah by call is probably the easiest guess here I probably should have done that not sure why I didn't that's okay round three this is probably uh oh this is Texas is any Texas Finn Oscar bag getting the road what the bag finishing today 23 seconds for bag today okay four four four five five okay round four course anyone getting course lots of people get course boki macka myself Finn Linley d bag and Jami France getting um C Portugal Albania yeah round five what was this oh this was the Colorado oceanman us goat get in Colorado Chumley contas Linley Buzzy and Blinky getting Colorado oh my God I forgot to update the new score sheet I'll do it I'll do it we'll keep the new score I'll hold myself accountable couple Wyoming Idaho Montana actually only RC there a couple people are Wyoming with me okay all right and then the 10 second I messed up my Rush here so I probably didn't do as well either 18th okay 25 people playing that's fine round one batswana yeah that's the overcast Road my Ziggy Linley Gorka and I think I said R my Linley Gorka Ziggy getting the north south Ro there bokei everyone close going west there round two oops round two what was this oh this was the rush over here great guess by trctor bokei L dud Len popped off wait Lenley actually popped off good job Lenley Blinky bokei tricker nice guess there everyone getting this presumably yeah sa around four any Juno guesser or Anchorage guessers Ziggy is Ziggy is like the most base person alive probably bro like honestly all right who got the town right trior and RC dude tricker popped off wait dude what happened to Trier in round three not to single the guy out but I'm curious now oh that happened that's unfortunate no it's okay he played really well and then yeah check yeah all right watch this Finn getting three we're starting over ocean man getting two and consus getting one and then 10 second we have Linley getting three Anna getting two and Blinky getting one and I'll see you guys ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 28.908308512083398, "lng": -81.97338484353538}, {"round": 2, "lat": 28.31718698206608, "lng":

right would you look at that it's another day to play the game as you guys sir and it's another day to wake up with the privilege to use your freaking Noggin round one Bounce World let's use it and that's what we're doing right now okay this Mexico wait is this ever the US like I thought it was mexo at first but then I looked over here and I saw this sign not sure you guys can see this the sign right here it looks like a sign that you would see in the US and not Mexico or would you see in like Argentina or something like that but like this road and like the soil of like the rocks and everything looks more American than it does anything else but I don't know where like you would get this Ridge like this in the US like Utah Arizona New [Music] Mexico that was Texas oh was like on the border of Texas Mexico I mean getting us here is actually not the easiest thing I think I think most people probably go Mexico or like yeah I don't know what a cool location oh wow this is super cool yeah I've never seen this actually before I wonder if someone will recognize this though What's this called Eagle's Nest it's a historical landmark yeah that's really cool I love stuff like that that's pretty cool Arizona I mean that's a fine guess in my opinion round two okay this looks weird because it looks like it should be the 7even in but like something about it feels off like this mountain in the background doesn't feel like it should be on the seven like it doesn't look like mountains in that area but like everything else like the road does the trees on the side of the road does the soil does so now I'm conflicted but this house in the back here like this feels like it could be maybe it's just like more North and that's why I'm confused and like a different mountain range up north that's not the seven but has similar soil it was just near the seven why do it look so weird Okay Canada you go newy here or what do you do here I don't know it looks like it looks like it could be newy also looks like it could be like I don't know I think I go newy here a straight North South Road I mean what else could this be it could be is it ever like wait is there water West do I go more North up here is there things on there's lande on the other side of the mountain there the hill there ah [ __ ] yeah this is a bad guess probably no it's not okay that's a great guess I actually probably could have found that in like 10 minutes you know North South Road with water West like that like that's a findable road right there the 480 it's a findable road all right let's not blow it away here and this will not be an easy guess at all these random Europe rounds are not fun to me or I guess they are fun Romania Bulgaria I don't think you go anywhere else here besides Romania or Bulgaria I could see like a crazy poal no it's never po valy Italy right sorry guys I'm really concentrated here I could maybe see something like a crazy France czechy Italy but this road quality and like this pavement looks more like Bulgarian Romania I don't know Poland I'd be lying if I thought Poland for like more than one second no I don't go pulling on that I thought I just don't go pulling I can't I I reduce the cope reduce the cope and if this is uh this is just some out um a fine day I guess all right Terminus time everyone lock in also it's time we retire Terminus it's been like four or five months now probably that we've had Terminus going it's good for Content I have a proposition what these not to be like the average like beggar on YouTube right but like what these videos usually get like 2,000 likes if we get 5,000 likes I'll switch the map to skewed World on 10 seconds if you guys know what skewed world is takes the road your POV of the road shifts to the side so all you're looking at is trees you don't get any clues other side is trees and in 10 seconds I would probably cope a lot 5,000 likes I'll switch to sced world all right but for now let's just do 10-c Terminus and we'll see tomorrow I'm raining have you ever seen the is this a crazy Western Singapore no it's like Hong Kong or something ah I couldn't find Hong Kong that's embarrassing uh I guess just go Taiwan bro we're just playing like what is this is this Sakia Hungary czechia I guess we have the concrete on the bomb that pull there makes me want to go Slovakia or Hungary uh Austria the architecture like more a what is this this looks like Dutch pavement round four it's a classic round four choke we'll see no okay we're good wait what is this us wait is this Canada like be see candle like Seattle it's definitely p&w but like I go like here bro it's where that [ __ ] all right all in all a decent day I think again per usual theor of stor is couple of good guesses couple bad guesses life goes on let's see how everyone else does I like it looks like us but I don't know the road which is a little concerning and it looks like Mexico but again I don't recognize the road I don't know I feel like I will go Mexico though like a durang or do I want to go us it's going to be like that one area I don't know okay yeah Texas border oh that's kind of a crazy road yeah I mean of course I'm not going to know that road Chile maybe like I don't know I'm trying to think of what else makes sense I think it has to be ch I wouldn't go too far south here I think I think like something like this would be good okay yeah we're all in that area okay newy yeah I mean it feels kind of more like norish maybe slightly I'm I don't know don't know exactly where I want to go but yeah oh no it's here all right what could this be 22 do I just go Poland I don't really like Poland but I don't have a better guess yeah I'll just stick to that okay was Poland I actually don't know if this is Sweden or Estonia I don't know I go s in here I don't think it's too far north okay all right second good yeah wait wait what wait you saw that right wait scroll down Hong Kong Mark okay Tai one okay o that is nice but what is this I don't know check here Austria okay Austria makes sense yeah um I thought like Juno Alaska okay dude it's that place again oh my God had the same reaction oh my God and you did the same thing twice I think I think you went Juno in the last one too yeah I mean it just looks like there in Alaska you know and I know what Alaska looks like I haven't studied Prince rert Canada well maybe you start maybe you need to bro it's time yeah maybe I need to I guess all right all right song of the day song of the dayit wait wait before the song of the day do we do we show them the song of the theme song well you got to show before you know I have to show them before guys I paid someone to uh make a theme song for segment song of the day I'll play it be careful your ears don't get pregnant ooh so clap your hands and yell hooray [Music] it's now you can say the song of the day all right song of the day is Secrets parentheses your fire by magdalina Bay uh it's a banger and yeah I just thought I'd switch it up today Secrets what your fire in parenthesis your fire uh what no this making a One Republic joke y oh it's not spell like that like y u apostrophe r it's like y r this is uh the album cover looks like Vaper wave or something it's not really Vapor wave it's like some electronic stuff but um I don't know it's like a poppy electronic stuff I don't know all right a RC song of the day all right it's next day let's go through this real quick round one let's see where I placed I got 13th out of 25 we'll take it round one oh what this oh we're doing Terminus first okay well it's backwards that's okay um it looks like I'm hedging Taiwan Hong Kong but in real I just couldn't get to Hong Kong on the map in time skill you round two Taiwan round three was this is Austria okay there's other people in Sakia czechia architecture there felt the most obvious four Austria so sh everyone there um round four Netherlands pavement couple people in Poland and then round five was Prince rer did anyone get Prince rer no everyone's in p&w or BC Washington and Juno and then on the 42nd round one anyone in okay Ziggy based Ziggy guess honestly based Ziggy guess con great guest here in Texas ocean man couple people in Texas Mexico maybe some arge yeah kind of all over the place here but great guess there round two was chill anyone get really close axle got really close in around country but really close Emily G guess round three what was this oh this was the newy lot people newy here four every going Canada though Poland this is not easy Poland my and mackam Val me couple Hungary Poland Shad to RC snil totic ocean man Jami Lenley freaking Poland and probably Oscar's probably the closest in czechia yeah and Blinky so GG's round five was Sweden Southern Sweden pays off Gorka great guest there with Linley Axel or Linley Emily and trior I'll update the new score sheet and we'll start fresh if we do skew world tomorrow but we'll see I'll see

right it's another day to play the game with gester and it's another day to have the privilege to use your freaking Noggin round one balce world let's lock in boring okay round two less boring okay where you go Montana here probably yeah okay two guesses I I should start guessing quicker okay water East let's think Australia Australia I my Mia thought was like it could be like one of the coasts like over here don't think we see see any other lande though this water's like East so like that doesn't really make where water East like this Mak sense though water East in Australia is kind of crazy it's not over there I guess it has to be like in this peninsula somewhere is every no but you can't see land so this makes no sense well that theoretically makes sense for not being able to see land I you know in hindsight with water East and looking like that maybe that does make sense that's why I was so confused okay this looks like a standard US okay I mean it definitely looks like it feels like this region you ever go New York here though like low key like upstate New York York I'm I'm going to do it these trees kind of feel like New York let me think the rumbl strips nothing really Gs are interesting can't see any plates nothing here really of value I'm making some great call outs today I'm making just some allaround just like great call outs but unfortunately it comes around five where you actually need five good guesses to be able to have a good score and unfortunately that's where this comes in in because I don't know what this is Columbia I thought for a second it was like a weird Guatemala um that went out of the window pretty quickly I thought Mexico or Columbia and I guess I go Mexico I guess this could be Columbia what else could this be is this ever Indonesia yeah guys I'm sorry I made a couple good guesses and I hope you remember those and not this guess I'm about to make and that's what's important ah okay I was I was never going Dr in that just wasn't that's the type of thing that you have to play Dr to get I've never I'm never going to Dr on that I said maybe a weird Guatamala maybe that makes sense maybe I could have deducted some guesses there but yeah it's one it's also like one of those things where like now you've seen it once you'll get it next time like something like this cuz I go Dr on this I go Dr on that CU a house that's just a good lock by De there you can't you can't be mad at that I mean you got Dr everything here is Dr how do he find a lock that had no poles in it that's such a good lock bro but rounds like that you don't cope you just accept would I have got I would have got more points going Colo oh I actually had three good guesses I this wasn't a good guess New York was a good guess Montana was a good guess ukan was I mean that's even a good guess that's just free all right it's second Terminus hopefully we can lock in here I just need one good game please just give me one good game I don't ask for much I do that's okay because today it's just give me just one game yeah is this like a crazy eswa like a crazy eswatini or is it look C2 ah I can't click okay um okay this field lowkey just feels Ukrainian I'm not really sure where else to go it could be Russia but I mean that's a good five cop because I was like it could be so like that's fine oh this is not good for me though this is not good for me at all Chile is I don't I have no idea what to guess here Chile why the [ __ ] did I guess there I couldn't zoom in time but like I just guessed in like where it's like cold I mean getting chil there is a good shout okay dude they're not giving me easy countries like to guess Russia like I'm not very good at Region guessing Russia bro I'm going east near like no or something Australia if you [ __ ] me over one more time unfortunately though for them this is the freest Victoria of all time watch this there was a Victoria pole in the background I thought it was smart because I knew there was Victoria pole in the background and it wasn't Victoria pole in the background that was it how is that not a Victoria pole that's literally concrete [Music] [Applause] [Music] tingga don't do it bro tur that car around there we [Music] go that guy said [ __ ] [Music] it now he got motiv oh he was letting him go through that's what he was doing okay nice guy all right well let's see how everyone else does um yeah just go near here okay is it like Montana Idaho Washington something up here could be yeah I don't know it was Montana dude ah yeah is this like o maybe like

next day everyone rejoice as we look at scores together shall we where's Deborah guessing let's okay let's just isolate guesses and look let's look where is Deborah guessing today h plant Pierce and jhb bro is actually trying to guess not really he guesses until he gets rounds cool rounds and then he goes Haiti on I like what do this guy doing like he decided to guess on some and then okay if you guys don't know this is his map okay all right d jhb is getting closer by the day round one game one let's do it I want to do that round one what was this yukatan everyone get yukatan round two also it's the the rock walls the Mexico poles you get the rock walls of coming you can tan I'll try and educate okay Montana wait was I Lo only one in Montana NOP okay let's check the Border here Toro is in Montana couple in Idaho there BC and Washington makes sense couple Norway round three oh this is interesting okay lots of South Africa here that's uh no one getting Tasmania though we have a couple people going uh South Vic here and people on the road meet CG and RC on this road kry Island I like this guest I think that makes sense but yeah I never go Taz on that um couple zah couple Europe round four was New York Blinky insan guess couple people New York round five was okay like snow just grinded this map too much he's just getting repeats like I don't care like gu is just actually getting okay I love you snow it's a great guess but he got a repeat yesterday so I'm going to assume it's a repeat again today if he grinded this map back in 20 like 16 I'm coping sorry Snell I love you okay um Colo I mean like how do you get Dr in that you don't lot of cola Mexico guat um Philippines Thailand yeah it's not easy it's not easy for snail though it's easy because see this the goat 10 second round one was estin yeah this was me trying to get more West I you guys could have seen it okay um what was this turkey couple turkey Europe guess is there makes sense actually like in hindsight great guess I mean there's a lot of people in Ukraine here I thought it was Ukraine but it was just over the Border but great guess by Blinky trior and consus there anotic cly um just getting that kind of Western Russia feel round three was oh I'm the only one that got Chile right I wish I had like 10 more like three more seconds to like actually make a good guess I would probably guess like Santiago though but still conceps on there is crazy like without people the context of them like looking at my guess it looks like that's like the worst guess of all time because I just guessed like concepion on that is kind of crazy um lots of Peru Mexico Bolivia yeah lucky guest honestly on my part no back in consis getting that and then Australia any Vic enjoyers thank you my and Planet Pierce um great guess there Lots in Queensland couple NW here trick are good guess but not a bad day for [Music] me not a bad day did jhp get last he did by quite a large sum but tomorrow is a new day where we will maybe see the updated score sheet I have faith and I'll see you guys ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 20.6272329722264, "lng": -89.50093759845754}, {"round": 2, "lat":

right it's other day to wake up and play the game with you guys sir and it's another day to have the privilege to use your Noggin round one this is a USA beautiful fall coverage somewhere in the US you would presumably go like this is like the type of location that like you go down the road and you just like find like an empty field and like you just want to you just want to toss a pig skin with your you know your friends you know this is that type of location this fall coverage in the US just invokes that feeling you know like Sunday Night Football you know let's just okay let's uh let's think the yeah just Pennsylvania that's just oh okay Taiwan is an obvious answer here is it ever Hawaii or like Japan I'm going Hawaii here you don't win by going Taiwan and this I could see this being a crazy Hawaii oh there's yellow Road lines wait this is actually Hawaii is it wait or is that leaf no that's a leaf a [ __ ] I'm committed [Music] now you don't go Brazil on that you guys call out for being bad when did Hawaii get coverage let's figure out what month okay there's some Gin 2 here Gen 2 Hawaii okay if you get Brazil there you're actually just uh dude what is this seed brother okay uh me Europe obviously Noggin okay we're actually Noggin cing I mean yeah this is impossible quite frankly you just have to click Hungary Slovakia Bulgaria czechia Slovakia czechia Slovakia Hungary Bulgaria it's one of those um oh [ __ ] I mean darus Clicks in between all of them don't I don't go Rush on that I don't go Rush on that oh is this a Western Road in Cambodia this is a wait is my score 5,000 if people don't understand I play hard Maps because it's more fun to play okay this isn't this isn't easy I think it's just right over here yeah one of those oh no and then fill Philippines okay well we ended better than we started which is good to maximize some points here I'm just going to go here like I feel like it's okay well we didn't start off strong how many points I get here in Hawaii too yeah I mean no where even is this bro yeah like dude you that's actually crazy wait wait have I I have looked in this park dude should be somewhere is it this one it is dude oh my god dude I've looked at the [ __ ] Park and I didn't recognize it okay context I spent like a lot of time a couple weeks ago two three weeks ago trying to find a capture in Rio and this is like the locations looked at and I remember this like I actually have been on these roads before look cuz I was looking at the parking lot at the bottom here I think that's a cool lock wait where's the parking lot I was looking at somewhere over here but I've literally been on these roads before I had four locations there but like I would never recognize that as like the same but now I see it but that's very very hard to get yeah that's kind of crazy even here I don't go Brazil though either even in Gen 4 all right Terminus though hopefully that does not have anything like that that's for sure I mean we we came back strong but I don't think anyone really gets Brazil if they do it I think they're just cheating so it's okay C round two or game two this is Brazil um guess you go somewh south near like South actually even more south okay oh okay wait what is this wait is this like loky like Kenya Rwanda I'm going Rwanda here oh my God okay this could be a couple things I like Monty I like Serbia I like North Macedonia I like Serbia the most could be it could be anything in Eastern Europe though Greece makes sense okay okay this house feels like what this I mean it looks like Italy Slovenia or like or Austria or something Austria Slovenia yeah okay Philippines or Java or Philippines or Indo yeah this is a tossup ah I'm going Sula it was Sula okay I mean I just lost points going 2,000 points going Su on that it's crazy I could really get there in time but not bad yeah not much let's see if this what's this uh Pennsylvania town does it have any selling scove 4x4 trucks pulling at nothing [Music] about that [Music] showing off the power in that big heavy the Old Dominion see what Cliff has he oh right into the lower r one of the top 10 to get into round two it is the fastest 10 trucks out of round one will get to compete for the Fast Five final round and Chris wolf not able to get into the Fast Five but he does indeed make the highlight real all right let's see how everyone else does dude I've been looking at too much us and I mean I know it is the us but it's just like is this like Georgia or something no it's hard kind of reminds me of like the Tennessee Alabama border sort of stuff I'm GNA go like right here no Pennsylvania yeah I think I looked at too much Southern coverage recently what is this it's like a weird little rocky stuff over here is this like a big blur or something could be like a Japanese island maybe or even Taiwan uh it could be like a Taiwanese Island I don't know lyia hedge like one of these no it wasn't okay it was Brazil downtown Rio was like a treer or something okay I think this is Russia I mean very snowy you would go like sarov but is this like a just downtown or something could also be a little more south as well I think I'll go sov okay it was like Cambo maybe yeah I think that's what I'm going to go like one of these roads I don't know exactly where okay nice and then this should just be Philippines either minda now or like one of the Eastern Islands I don't know that I want to go men now here so I'm going to go like late or Samar or something around here okay nice what am I looking at I don't know Brazil or something like down here okay it was Brazil Kenya Rwanda I actually don't know I'm going to go Rwanda okay good it was Rwanda which country is this I don't know it's somewhere in this general area nmk Okay Greece sure it was something B I can tell you exactly okay I guess it's like Slovenia or Austria it looks like the South if it's Austria anyways maybe okay it was Slovenia yeah this looks like a South Thailand or something sure H it's just Indo okay I saw the I saw the roof and I thought it's either a tie roof or like a southa roof but yeah I guess it's southa it's a tough one I didn't think the landscape looked very southa to be honest yeah like I'm seeing I'm seeing some like oil palms and rubber trees over here I don't know SRA pal it's quite tough you know it's also tough what a song of the day not for me because I was in Atlanta today I was like downtown and stuff you know with a friend and obviously I have to pick an ail song today so the song of the day is at ens by Outcast oh wow Outcast thr your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care is that at alen [Music] yeah all right round one let's do this how many people played 20 dude look how close jhb was no 100 points less than 100 points less than like 30 points that's crazy tomorrow um where did I place seventh when you got fifth okay Pennsylvania Chumley Chumley got second place today and second place yesterday is crazy thought in Hawaii guess here I thought about Hawaii okay I did uh I saw like yellow lines and I was convinced but I guess Taiwan I mean taiwan's like the obvious answer I feel like yeah taiwan's obv I should have got Taiwan I feel out of odds any of these three aren't repeats I think Chumley just got a little bit lucky but snow and B are definitely repeats I mean snow callede maybe maybe just the goat bro maybe is just the goat rushia yeah I didn't get rushia on that I don't know why I probably should have the roads or like the trees on each side or yeah Western Cambo people going Africa ma wait look at Ma's guys he like basically got the fight oh what the hell Mac Kimo goat yeah he did learn Cambo I know I can tell I mean looks like it yeah all over Asia and Europe there they Asian Africa five oh Philly damn yep got the island oh never mind why did I think that was the this is super South I was not expecting it to be that South yeah round two oh this was fun I'm surprised more people than go Kenya to be honest yeah I was really not sure I felt like the random dirt road kind of made more sense for Rhonda but I could have seen Kenya yeah yeah I can I can see a lot what was this oh yeah anyone go Ser no one Serbia what the [ __ ] bro I mean Albania yeah GRE people two people getting gree all right yeah I mean that was not easy and this is just a syia yeah syia I guess and then the Sula that's my sir sand teammates right there dude you and JP Thailand goats bro like I feel like it was Thailand's Peninsula but yeah makes sense yeah I was hedging Sula Philly fair enough but uh yeah I didn't know Chum going maluku on gen 3 I think this should be more talked about I mean CH know what you're doing there CH yeah to go bro I didn't update

US this is not the US there's a [ __ ] truck is this Europe Water West H dude I got there in the end that was not pretty okay these Hills good Lord that was ugly that was ugly I got to Argentina and then I didn't go turkey that's okay Water West not sure why I went ba okay we have Hills okay where are these Hills are the hills over here maybe this Road's going Slightly North South so it have to be like here that doesn't really make sense um what other Road could it be it could be a road over here near cans I guess or maybe even closer to W over here black cart maybe go like here this makes sense [Music] maybe I know you love me I I know you care you shout when never and I'll be there what is this what the heck is this wait no is this American Samoa wait what is this okay wait what is this wait what is this okay wait I have zero idea what this is wait can I even find American SM on the map God I'm [ __ ] washed okay where would this be I don't even think this is American SM I have no guess here but this architecture kind of feels American Smo I have no idea what this is yeah it's not here oh wait that's low key a good guess that's actually a really good guess I did not know this had coverage over here though and that's actually really F I was like I couldn't find a bridge here that makes made sense okay it was American Samoa that's kind of a great guess just shout whenever I'll be there just guess South Australia dude shout to Justin Bieber haly Bieber sh it's really cool they're having a kid all right South Australia what we do is this ever New Gen 4 Kanger island or is this ever like lowy just like is ever like near rot Nest you know like in W No it should just be this should just be uh South Australia somewhere surely Western Australia um moral the story is [ __ ] Australia good night M all right the second Terminus let's lock in shall we honestly I'm not going to like talk like just watch my Noggin just like watch on display crazy call watch this I should start talking is there a worse guess in batswana unironically could you get a further away guess in b Florida or like no it's like loky Lou Mississippi Louisiana this is not going what is this what is this bro what is this Romania Bulgaria Russia it's probably it's freaking Texas bro this ain't Texas more [Music] West wait what is this Spain oh no oh no I have no idea what this is if this is like even dude I'm never using my nogin again might be last place today oh my I'm going have to take another walk today bro it's not even I'm not even upset about the Mexico Spain guess that's a fine guess in my opinion cope not getting North Carolina here is kind Southern Pines like maybe Mississippi isn't the greatest guess rert dude it's like one of those things the game where like North Carolina South Carolina just has no Aura like there's going to be nothing worth interesting of well we have this guy that keeps posting train videos in rer maybe this is I thought this is

like right on the shore that is Goofy as [ __ ] okay um I mean I want to go Florida I don't recognize the city though so I'm thinking I don't know it's kind of thinking like Jacksonville or like Pac or something yeah Jacksonville we'll stay there it could be more this way wait it was Argentina oh [ __ ] dude I was so I I uh yeah I don't know it's okay I focus so much on the McDonald's I didn't even McDonald's instantly sent dude literally does this have this driving direction I don't even remember but like I feel like it has to be this or something maybe more this way yeah we'll try we'll try something like this nope okay Norway and I don't think it's Northern I think it's just somewhere in this general area okay oh yeah this is a base lock this is um if I can find American Samoa it's on this island it's the bridge right here very goated lock I mean surely W but I'm just like trying to figure out where I don't think it's like the Northern Road I think it's just somewhere kind of here somewhere in this general area maybe like this road would make sense with the angle nope it's down here never mind okay there's a POI oh it's in like that place let's go to McDonald's oh it's in the mall kind of underwhelming not going to lie I mean yeah at least have a m Cafe yeah they do I uh don't know where this would be like downtown Gabon or something oh it's here okay H this feels like South Carolina or North Carolina somewhere over here okay nice I don't even know what I want to go like Poland or something Romania what I don't know what was Roman there maybe I missed the pole Texas it I don't know exactly how far south I want to go I'll just keep it there yeah it was South dude I thought it was Durango maybe or Chihuahua or something I don't know yeah Chihuahua okay was that like an easy mexo for you like do youone El's get like no I don't think I mean it wasn't straightforward but okay before you look at my guess can you name three other countries they be like oh rainbow that's okay I won't get shame you South Africa what's that Brazil wasn't that okay come on um I mean I don't know to me South Africa is an obvious second choice here but I guess um I don't know did you go Australia like these trees don't look Australian at all I think austral the rock okay wait okay it was in the northern hemisphere northern hemisphere is Kazakhstan okay never mind my guess is just probably really bad I went Spain on this oh uh I mean it feels like too wide open but I can see it like yeah uh landscape and vegetation wi that makes sense thanks I mean it wasn't in your top 10 guesses but I guess I'll take it it's like most pity I like yeah like I saw this house and I was like I did not think of Romania when I saw this I thought like Poland or something what's uh what's the song of the day song of the day is Von Dutch by Charlie XCX which I've had like in my head for like it's really catchy song that no it is so yeah Rond dut is like a new song of yours and it's really catchy all right it's next day let's see how we did we got 10th place out of 22 and jhb tomorrow is a new day brother I have faith um chumbley getting second place that's awesome and bad getting first place and 26 seconds on round four he spent 12 seconds to 5K that was probably the American smell we'll see round one Argentina lots of people going ba um how many people Santa Fe conas and totic great guest there Rosario shout out to bag and CG like how Do's bag even get to Rosario in foresight like recognizing I don't even know bro like couple us McDonald's happens Australia I mean wasn't a very easy Argentina okay this was Eddie and Oscar bag and uh bag and Oscar getting that that's a great guess over here on the road anyone over here okay we got a lot of people going this road up here too so it's validating um good guess by jhb honestly um D chumy great guess what's round three here this is the uh the Norway super South no one really going that South but uh still solid was okay the American SP this one I'm like upset over because like I feel like this is like something that like people have seen before if they've seen it because it's like cover checking they get it but uh yeah everyone getting that bridge I just haven't seen that bridge and I forgot that had coverage on the islands but me and CH over there on the other island Hawaii and we have a couple like Malay yeah and the this was the my downfall here just going W I thought the soil was too white but it was more red so makes sense there and Mi and Lenley g a great guess Oscar on the same road GG's oh no no i' see I clicked select all and I don't see very many people in Spain with me let's see where what I got here 15th okay that's not bad that's 15th is not bad I'm in good company I'm between cons and too cope okay round one was bot SW it yeah we were off to a very good start we weren't we just weren't no one really doing that South okay what was this oh this was a okay shout out to trior Mississippi guest on top RC G guess in uh South South Carolina it's just over the Border there um kind of going all over the US this was a crazy call by trior 2 I'm happy with my guess here too it wasn't easy um Russia all over Europe this was a very very hard location what did bag spend on this one did bag finish he did and he spent 20 seconds on this one round four Texas right round five okay okay so that's validated yeah maybe it wasn't Spain but at least I knew it wasn't but at least I knew it was a hard Mexico only two people G Mexico V and RC yeah no one else is in Spain they're all in South Africa but like it clearly was in South Africa guys clearly that I mean I would never go South Africa on that Spain is a better guess and maybe a different lifetime but life life that's life and believe it or not yeah the scy tomorrow's a new day if you guys if if you if I'm going to be honest I hit Level 44 in the fame pass on Fall Guys yesterday and like two days of playing maybe averaging seven hours a day of Fall Guys the score sheet will come when it comes and I'll see you guys ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -31.65202167106614, "lng": -60.70232788606151}, {"round": 2, "lat":

while you're South though you would have to be like over here um I lean towards cersa let's see if we can find these houses I don't know um okay it was cell I thought the coast was a lot closer than that Am I Wrong was a coast not super close uh I guess it's just perception no that's really not the close at all okay that's okay at least I got curse out right so I only lost 50 points round two um Portugal do you go Island here or just go do you go it's not medira so it's not aor but is this ever aor do I just go aor what if it's just Mainland like the Gen 2 I just automatically think it's going to be aor or something but if it's Mainland that's just silly silly because it looks like Mainland but like I'm going as I'm going which one of these has coverage is it this one it's this one does this have coverage I freaking hope that one has coverage I'm checking okay it has coverage they both have coverage okay is this is this gen two or Gen 4 it's gen two okay it was not a bad guess I have to pre- before I cope I have to fact check myself okay we're two for two so far around this is not Australia It's Brazil and I will not go yeah I mean I I literally think about that guest yesterday for like at least two hours like non-stop I I had to go take a walk outside because I was so like upset with my guess that's how bad it was okay um Mexico yeah one would think you just go cdmx but I want to go like something like it looks a little more drier like Coastal AC does AC mean anything on that sign AC I don't think so is that water South actually it looks like lowkey water South am I throwing on a stack no KY for real for real is that not water South it's probably not that water unless it's like a body small body of water like that that was way more North okay it's fine actually it wasn't really that much more north um okay see there's this thing where you always go Bolivia when it's Peru and you always go Peru when it's Bolivia but lucky for me I'm not doing that one today I'm going Bolivia right and guessing the PA and getting a good score such as life I mean yeah it happens let's keep going Terminus though did someone else make their name Terminus hello rainbow Terminus Terminus love you rainbow keep with the thank you Al colan Mr play this map or I'm coming L just kidding I'll play it I won't finish it though so he doesn't know I'm playing it what is this guy like what this guy what is this map is he making this like references or like is he just want me to play his map confused I'm not sure what that was but that's okay let's keep it going since second Terminus let's act like we've been here before because we have I hope okay brick walls Rock walls with this you go Bari or Palama nice that's a great guess um Southern us um that looks like the I mean that's the Florida outline there you go Northern Florida I guess go s like more south head south a bit yeah it's just freaking Tampa um is this Malaysia wait what is this wait is this Argentina I I can't get to Mid legian time so I have to guess Argentina I not is this Thailand this is not easy oh my God what is this Thailand is the only I can think of here like Northern Thailand if it's not yeah okay good guess are we back in the US or what is this this doesn't really really look American wait what is this this is this is Europe I don't know what this is France green triangle really I like my I think my Belgium call here isn't bad because I can see people going America here but yeah wasn't really that bad of a day to be honest besides that Peru Bolivia because that was just in my head it was fine um I'm not sure why I thought this was Malaysia for the longest time this is not an easy Argentina low key all right let's see what Florida city was this in the thing about getting Florida is I'm pretty much like like I have to look in to see what the Florida man news article went on in Arcadia Florida now like I just have to Florida man finds fully intact Mammoth jaw while diving in alligator infested waters Arcadia Florida a man found a rare fully intact Mammoth jaw he estimates is about 10,000 years old what the [ __ ] yeah Arcadia is on top Arcadia ston said at all-time high bro what the [ __ ] police bus driver a beauty Patrol vehicle in Central Florida teenager nabbed in National booty Behavior protection truck says it it was just funny it's never meant to be anything bad the driver of a booty patrol truck in Florida parading border patrol Vehicles was pulled over by local what bro there's actually no way the truck store also features a decal that says National Beauty Behavior protection the sh County Sheriff Office posted about the truck on Monday to raise awareness oh it was claimed to pulling over other vehicles okay that's not cool I mean that's average florid of activities I guess that's greased up naked Florida man arrested after Crim spree all right I think that's enough news articles for the day was a fine day all around I would say nothing too crazy nothing too bad some good guesses some decent guesses no real bad guesses but let's see how every else does all right I think this is cell and I will just click here okay this one I guess we have holes in the pole so probably just Portugal then I think that seems right and I'll just go lisbin oh okay okay that's interesting I mean it was Portugal but I don't know like I could go tokun tees here but I was kind of feeling a interesting guess and go like Baya or something could even be minus so I'm going to go for that oh I cooked let's go all right Mexico my first thought was just like CDM Max to be honest the pavement is interesting the pavement would suggest maybe Waka oh we have a 649 600s I forget where they are wait okay let me think is that this one maybe or something like monter or is this one sixes this one might be sixes I don't know okay well going there actually helped out in the end so I don't remember where the sixes are but yeah probably close my first thought was Peru but I just want to make sure yeah I feel like feel like it is Peru it feels like not too far away from Cusco to be honest like this road maybe or something okay nice it was CCO RC you got first place by going [ __ ] Lisbon on Madera or aor hey we'll take that all right and I uh scripted to be Ziggy last one as well so by actual like eight points dude that's that's just me that's just me things right there um Spain Spain Spain Spain like exad Dura maybe ah mayor yeah all right um it's a tough one maybe Arkansas Florida oh okay yeah where in AR is this I don't know just G to go here H it's downt you're gu or gu that's crazy all right uh I see bamboo I kind of want to go like Thailand or something could be like Shri Cambo it was Thailand okay good and I would say Southern again but again I have no idea so I'm going to head Georgia never mind that was not a Southern Pine wait zigg is a goat Ziggy is a goat yeah I don't know why I assume that was a Southern Pine then that's actually French but it look like lowkey this stuff looks like a US sort of like I thought property sign wait I think this thing wait what is this thing right here that your cursor I was like I don't think I've ever seen like something like that and that's why I was confused yeah that's true yeah Tricky Tricky Tricky I mean good luck can only script one game a day where it's too obvious you know am I head by 6,000 points you're just the goat wait what happened I didn't think it was that like where was the discrepancy points I mean there were a lot of tough rounds maybe the Thailand or wait click the click the Florida one bro you're going to kick yourself there's a little Florida outline on the car in front of us oh yeah there is all right what's the song of the day okay song of the day since today's my last day in Athens last day of the semester you know um so I'm picking a local Athens band the b52s uh and if you know if you know their song yeah their song Love

the longest time it went through my head but I felt like the landscape didn't uh myth the goat dude I came I don't know yeah I don't know how that's ba and I don't know how no one guesses there that's that's probably the even weirder thing that nobody even guessed be yeah what was it oh Thailand that one was pretty tough guess yeah Ian where I could have seen Philly yeah I could have seen Malaysia

right it's another day to play the game of Jer and it's another day to wake up with the privilege to use your Noggin round one oh this is fun okay because the question is is it South Africa or Australia and the answer is probably Australia because it shouldn't be South Africa because it should be Australia because it should be Australia Outback I think I've seen something like this over here in NW yeah just a great great oh no first thing that came to mind here was Taiwan on a port with water South okay let's think what else could this be Mexico is this ever Mexico this is impossible there's not even any vegetation to go off of here it's literally a concrete road this never Mexico right I have to go Taiwan here right ah no it's never Taiwan I was doing so well bro we're literally volcanic rock is ever like a crazy Greenland or something why is the water like just chilling in the freaking like what what is the car doing bro I'm not getting this right it's never like a zor or Portugal or like aor or Madera or aor or canaries is it do I go canaries here I have no idea what to guess here everyone like oh my I have no idea what ah I freaking timed out dude I was getting zero points anyways was that low cam uh is this like ever like Yukon I'm I'm is this ever Alaska no it's not yellow plate looks like it could be on the road to Alaska [ __ ] if this is like more south or something it's whatever oh okay well I did not mean to get that road right why couldn't it like I just get Japan hotel hotel Turkish pil Dingle what what the [ __ ] okay um what is this wait what what is this why is it in English what is this is this South Africa is this is this Europe or South AFA like I don't even know it I have no idea what the Argentina I mean I didn't what have we seen more highs and more lows okay was this low cam I could tell there was like a car but like I couldn't someone's going to get this right for sure all right well I mean we had a couple of good guesses I didn't mean I didn't mean to get this road right um that was horrible that was not an easy Taiwan there might be people that don't break 4,000 score today all right 10 second termin this I'm actually happy with how the game went though honestly it could have been worse like I could have blundered the Taiwan I could have got in Japan and in Argentina but that those are insanely difficult and um okay no front plates Southern us um a [ __ ] I'm never beating the allegation I just got 7 km away guess the city on accident that's not skill that was accident I will never claim that skill that is accident luck is an opportunity meets skill lock in uh that house feel is Nordic but nothing here feels Nordic at all looks like Russia ah okay [ __ ] okay Argentina or is this Argentina or what is this this is not easy okay is this Australia what is this Australia Brazil oh my God oh please Lord give me the patience please Lord give me the patience why did I dude this house in the back tell me that it doesn't look Australian these trees tell me those don't look Australian the soil obviously is in Australia but I've timed out twice I was going [ __ ] BR anyway I can't cope it's such a free Brazil but when there's any ounce of like oh you did good don't choke it choke let's focus on the highs let's focus on let's not discredit the highs of today which is getting six mile shout out to freaking Eminem I hit the Gertie with him in fortnite at least once a day yes I know it's 8 Mile don't tell me in the comments rainbow a I know okay I'm not going to lie guys Six Mile looks boring they have okay they have bare Falls and Falls though so that's already a dub just not brown it looks like [ __ ] sorry which St Falls um okay they're kind of balling though not going to lie here yeah believe it or not this random small City in uh South Carolina's got no uh has no Aura sometimes it be like that um let's focus on the highs and not on the lows let's see how everyone else does but what is this I I mean I would have said like here somewhere but I don't yeah I don't know okay it is yeah is this penu probably I mean unless it's Mainland but I don't know I feel like I want to go pengu here it's findable okay the fact that I'm not seeing is like you feel a little concerned to be honest I don't know okay it was just Mainland yeah wow this is sure I thought Korea like juu with the black rocks I wonder if it's like this island or something time to scan for some more water 35k oh oh it's Japan okay that was purely off the Rocks so well first guess that good yeah I don't know probably say like this red yeah okay o is this um iguasu no the water angle doesn't really make sense maybe it's uh padas yeah I'm not seeing it but yeah no okay colon I I've never seen that yeah I've never seen anything but yeah no went South Africa on that happens is this like here no it's just south that was Norway this like no how do I how do I even think Australia on this oh my God I'm cring so hard I I even know if I can post that bro that's actually one of my worst gu of all time helina coverage I don't know no it's okay I mean yeah that house looks very Southern but I don't these trees look very strange to me I guess okay we did have like red soil too actually what am I doing this this around was impossible though like I mean unless you got the vibe actually a lot of people got the maybe I guess it was kind of low car although yeah I D I'm went Greenland on this cuz like okay it looks like there's a car meta but like I don't know I don't know where to go I I tried guessing canaries because I just had no idea but I definitely go Greenland so yeah and I don't know why I did not get AR on that my vibe detector was just off I guess like there it's very Arch but like yeah I don't know you just have to like see like I feel like all the towns on the on the rivers around Arch look exactly like this yeah this was my original thought I thought we were overlooking like here somewhere but the road angle didn't make sense but you can see how the coverage yeah exactly I can see it like this coverage is the exact basically it's like Overexposed sunset or some [ __ ] I don't know what that is like yeah no it's uh blue but it's like the 2019 coverage 2021 B don't think I know same what's the song of the day though like for real I think I kind of picked a bunch of songs in like a similar sort of genre so I got to Branch out go to one of my alltime faves um so I'm going to pick Kiss of Life by shade all right GG's sh is just amaz all right it's the next day let's see how I did this one I got 14th and I will presume on the next one I got last so not the greatest day for boy that's okay round one was in Eddie get in the right Road there I mean he is in Australia main so it does make sense everyone getting inw if they're going Australia couple W all valid this was Taiwan what Mexico I thought it was but everyone get ended getting Taiwan here couple pangu and did Blinky get the port right Blinky found the port couple Philippines Mexico round three what was this oh this is the island I tried going canaries um Greenland I called the Greenland gas I like the Greenland gas Iceland makes sense Norway um Toro and Chumley goats couple at Japan we got some JJ guessers with the black rock um they're Volcan crck Taiwan and Antarctica guess I like that I like that guess wait there's more than 25 people playing okay jhp got 3,000 points okay round four okay a lot of people getting this for Dr right consis bag RC snail getting it is that foul of course foul fungus I'm sorry Blinky and the round five was yeah not my best guess but like there's people in Europe so it's validated you know Argentina D great call out there by D getting really really close but RC coped enough so I'll probably get it again if I get a location on that River again that's why we play these games to learn and then the 10 second didn't quite get last that's encouraging but Craig performed here earlier today for some school kids that was on fire at that time and seems to right now all right round one let's do this this was oh yeah this was insane okay trctor trior why was there two trickers I know okay a lot of people getting close here round two was great guess at nor here shout out to snail my teammate going north I just fumbled that so it's okay um round three okay arge okay did Lenley actually change his Lenley Chang his profile picture to trior so I actually can't tell who's who now this guy's actually trolling bro is this trior or is this lley or is this trior or is this lley it was it was an honest mistake I did like twice LLY okay I don't know how I even ever thought this was in Brazil that might be one of my worst blunders of all time like quite literally ever but that's okay because life and I also believe it or not probably didn't update the score sheet maybe I will tomorrow also I forgot to mention this but if you guys remember like a couple months ago I added like I made a Spotify album with like my favorite sounds from Thailand that I've been to for like sleeping and [ __ ] we have to change my farmers market and all this stuff but I added a new uh like ocean sounds my favorite ocean sounds um on the outour beach in Nang but um yeah you got like faint roosters in this one it's kind of sick okay I spent a lot of time on these to perfect them and believe it or not my Thailand sounds have like two million streams on Pandora and we're getting up there on Spotify okay so if you see me at the freaking Grammys you'll know why I'll put the link in the description if you guys want to listen but it's my favorite beaches so good sounds and I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 23.05368048878281,

somewhere is this like lowy like up here I'm going try it I'm not the guy but sometimes I am that guy oh no this is not good um call an ambulance why does this Loki feel American why does this Loki

this us or turkey or what is this where do I even guess in oh this is bad this is bad look it's okay okay Portugal s um we have the Portuguese pavement here by the way guys that's how you know it's Portugal it's a real thing when it's like Checker like that yeah know just out here teaching guys tips you know you know me just being a yeah I don't know Southern Portugal probably just lesbian okay um yeah I played well I messed up my Russia guess probably and I didn't know where to guess here I mean silt all right Terminus though let's let's keep the ball rolling here no we'll go back to silt and see what we got let's just make sure we get our Pace this is a good game we keep the momentum going um this is Eastern Germany like Max East like something up here okay bro how is it not Berlin is this lowkey canaries or yeah I'm going to go canaries here what island though don't know yeah that's a good guess what Ballard is that M Fred oh [ __ ] I'm about to scream and shot let what is this turkey I almost went turkey on that oh my God this literally looks like Germany oh my God if it's Luxembourg how is this Russia yeah it's a free Russia oh I'm so silly I'm so silly that's such a free Russia this is why you don't use ballards I thought it was a Hungarian Ballard for some reason I just completely forgot that Russia uses ballards like that sometimes immortalizing your mistakes on internet is a very humbling thing to do though so it's okay well welcome to beautiful downtown bro recording in gen One camera that's crazy Colorado yeah that's like AO where we play music really loud and offend the neighbors because it's fun over there is a church where I'm at my husband well I didn't meet him there but that's where we wound up meeting each other again when we were like eight after we had met initially when we were four goals oh that's where he is yep and he lived right over there down the street and [Music] this shake it up oh my god dude silk Colorado has UFOs oh my god dude oh my God not the UFOs in silk Colorado though this is groundbreaking evidence I think I go uh iOS here okay um I think it should be Poland and I would just go very Central like yesterday um this one's interesting it's like Sandy that's kind of weird I was kind of thinking like somewhere over here maybe see okay nice ooh okay so I think it should be the US H where would this be it's like pretty hilly like my first thought was Colorado but now I'm not thinking that anymore kind of thinking something like Idaho is possible or like I don't know I might just go like T on Village or something CU I don't know it could be like here in Colorado a dude it was right there I had the f I should have gone there my first that was like my first thought oh my God I should sent that I still have to I'm reging gu I think we're like here okay hey I'm still in first bro you'll probably still get first but like that could have been a really good seed like that could have been yeah insane seed so uh Eastern German pavment should be like here never mind why do I think like canaries or something uh okay it was just yeah should have gotone gr Canaria uh Hungary no is it what is it is it Hungary no it's actually Russia okay I thought that might be a Russian Ballard dude you did the exact same thing I did bro this is I think it's Albania right okay yeah and then this feels like this area over here okay pretty good still third I mean did you script to I don't think that many people yeah I did script to wait is that 11 points yep classic I mean you have pretty base guesses overall you want you hear with me you want hear with me where did I lose maybe just how maybe just work on your Albania region I literally lost to Albania are you kidding tough look at this lovely design but like how often are you seeing a fortified church I mean there's quite a few of them I guess but you just click middle if you see them so does it really help what I do anyways I use some of my own pictures nice all right RC what's the song of the day all right so uh this is uh I got this idea from someone in the comments from yesterday's video um so you know how we had like a Kingston Ontario round someone in the comments mentioned Kingston by Fay Webster and I was like dude yes I got him put this is the next I saw that comment I had no idea what that meant Kingston by Fay Webster shout

last place in every single seed let us know in the comments jhb we believe in you unfortunately this was a Germany not Serbia everyone look how many people are East Germany though that's actually it's a free East Germany if you don't go East Germany it's skills you honestly round two was canaries lots of people get canaries here people over um South Africa makes sense too I think but um yeah canaries um how many what time did bag bag 20 seconds stay for bag that's on par um thank God there's more people in Hungary okay that's just a silly mistake but uh yeah J Gen 4 winter coverage like that is uh in central Russia over here so the these guyses make sense you can get elsewhere too so sn's guess is validated um but yeah round four was in alvania um lots of good guesses here uh Monte Albania and round round five your guess my Conant here everyone getting Germany um let's see jhb another day all right round one what Nigeria um everyone going like us tricker knowing the neighborhood

Poland Max North okay round two 673 this is a um this is a Ontario cone like construction cone the black and yellow so this is going to be Ontario 673 and actually don't know the area code but it looks like a place there's like holiday in express here so like place where there's like at least high traffic of like highways or something right it doesn't really look like over here though it's not near Thunder bit I'm going go like near like subb Kingston or what was that what say that yeah Kingston um okay is that a Danish flag or L that has to be what flag is that Let's ignore the flag are we

what this [Music] is I'm okay with that I'm upset with this guess cuz how is this actually Kingston like that looked way too cold I know maybe I'm tripping look just it looked more North this is just like a cop because it's southern Italy and I went Greece I could lowkey get top three here because that was not easy at all and I got this turkey guess that turkey guess is GNA like whoever gets that right and I will get closer than some people in Italy if they go Italy here it's the name of the game and I recognize born I'm still upset I can't really Compass that's cringe um and then yeah Kingston I lose a lot of points on Kingston this will probably be the downfall of me unfortunately should just click Toronto not the only person taking L's in Ontario today though so all right termin

ominous Place reserved for the worst of the worst of Canadian convicts Kingston pen it first opened in 18 there's a drake joke to be made here but I'm not making it it's now closed for business yet there's something so strangely fascinating about it that hundreds of people have paid to get a glimpse of what life was like inside for decades locals and tourists have been intrigued by the mystery Behind These Walls the United Way is running these tours for just 3 weeks 9,000 tickets to see these cramped cells and haunting Halls sold out fast I remember watching the riots and the pictures and I always thought I got to see why they're so crazy in here and do you have a sense now yeah oh yes very much so oh my God we've done it damn they can looky dive though [Music] put the phone down no this reminds me of like when I was in high school like our school used to do this thing where they would like get classmates from am I am I Mis from do this actually happen it feels like a fever dream but like honestly anything before like I graduate high school I don't even I don't remember like any part of that of my life but like I firmly remember like then bringing us like this Auditorium or like this like football field in like a different city and they would have our like some classmates and pretend to be in the crack and they would like these police would come in and like act like one of the classmates die because they like were texting and driving or drinking and driving or something and they would like bring him out in like an ambulance and then like then we would go to like the inside of the basketball stadium or like the this the the court or whatever the gym and then they and there would be like their parents crying and like this is like a skit and it was like uh what else happened I don't know like maybe it worked though so like if it works it works cuz like it's not cool but like lowy gets traumatizing did anyone else have those or anyone have any idea what I'm talking about at all like the skits of like drinking and driving skits where they would like dude I'm probably sounding like an idiot now it starts with the coach banging on the door profanity shouted then an argument ensues the referee ejects the coach from the game but instead of leaving he walks out onto the ice he spit on him and he just defended himself now he just uh got up and started throwing punches Witnesses at the bog in Kingston say the coach started it by spitting in the ref's face the referee eventually tackled to the ground while 12-year-old children look on I just can't believe someone would actually do that to a referee that referee is Eugene benda's uncle binda is a referee coordinator and refs at the Collegiate and professional levels he says he's never seen something like this before the most disturbing part of the whole video is you watch the players on the ice and after the altercation they you see some of the kids uh like banging the sticks like like nice job average like hockey player ref finished the game with a few bumps and bruises the coach fired shortly after Junior Monarch say that coach will never coach for them again that referee is doing okay tonight we're in Kingston I'm Peter leopolis WCVB let's see how everyone else does all right po I think a center guess is good here B all right let's see what is a 613 I actually have never heard of that but we Ontario thing so yeah I mean you'd have to go Toronto here I think okay 613 I guess is probably this uh I recognize that oh it's born home that's what it is I knew I recognized the uh shape of it yeah so I guess it's like probably just here okay nice maybe like siisy something could be grease as well turkey is possible it's like a reservoir I guess surely I'll find this yep right here no okay it was itly at least that's good okay and then why do we have an antenna here what is that antenna doing is it like rgds or something maybe it's just the us cuz us can also have antennas no I don't know my first thought was like rgds okay now what uh is it it's like North no it's not it's Mexico damn um I thought the BR screwed Maybe okay good South Gambia surely I kind want to go like this road or this one no okay um I don't know Slovenia Slovakia okay I think I just go like goas or something or oh actually you know what I was I was like thinking about M so what's the song of the day so recently I've been really into wise blood so I'm going to say Andromeda by wi BL Give a listen thanks RC M all right it's the next day let's see how we did we got fifth place out of 25 o 27 people we also added jhb to the squad if you guys know jhb he will probably get last every day but that's okay because he's cying let's see how everyone everyone did round one um Poland yeah the trees polish trees if you know you know round two was uh the Ontario cone no one getting Kingston there any up here in sbur oh maol Linley and V up here with me all over um it's couple quec uh Toronto you The Vibes round three is just born home um yeah bro can't really Compass that's okay shout to everyone lots of people got that right that's pretty much the whole Lobby um yeah other people getting DeMark just not really probably not seeing the outline there what was around four oh this is Italy South by Jacob nipped RC and Jami getting that couple people in Greece couple people turkey Bulgaria Spain us yeah all over the place and round five is Turkey um Finn okay Finn Blinky good guess by Blinky there snail myself consis TR Lenley and South bying Turkey all over Europe there and then on the 10c we have Mexico Colo happens around two was oh this is aan Russ I guarantee you Finn got the five yeah Finn check him PC yeah I mean he's the best Russian player so that makes sense this road is probably pretty distinct once you've seen it though so I'll probably get it right again thank you southp for going that same road as me people going all over Russia here round three was Sagle totic on the road based everyone getting or most people going south of Gambia there with how green it was around four was oh this is a Sakia chumbley D Oscar totic and snail and then just the Brazil great guest is there in Brazil and GBS I'll see you guys hopefully with an updated score sheet tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 44.276539559089116, "lng": -76.56300932402075}, {"round": 2,

right it's another day to play the game of you guys sir it's also another day that we all get to wake up and have the privilege to use our Noggin and let that sink in for a second you get to use your Noggin today what a powerful thing to do round one wow not easy at all oh man oh I love this I love rounds like this so much this fuels me that was kind of cringe I'm not going to lie this is giving weirdly like Baltic Vibes but like it's never Baltic but like Poland Northern this house is never polish this house right here feels like French is this like green triangle or like Italy freak dude Northern Spain freak dude him okay water South Oh What a Beautiful Mount dude I like I actually got like I want to like I get emotional looking at this okay is it ever this canal or this channel down here are these mountains big enough South okay is there a road here no if this okay is this Chile Argentina though actually fre if find I I want to say it's down I spent too much time is there even coverage down here like I don't know I'll try this road okay this will be Northeast Brazil I want to go pwi I'm just gonna send dude I like guess you go Queensland here like Max North Queensland like cans KS how you say it something up here oh my God I mean that's an easy guess cuz I recognize mountain range but like it's still such a rewarding feeling I when you like you had them when I had them and shared that moment with those mountains that was just something special okay okay um and then wow what another beautiful location dude de [ __ ] love that guy dude okay these Road lines look lowkey wide are these wide Road lines like lowy going to give us like Eastern Washington or something over here or do I just like commit like a um like a Colorado or something I'm going to go like loky Eastern Oregon something over here I've already made like I don't care like I've already made my good guesses for the day round five round five chokes are inevitable at this point okay inside Theo what a great game I'm very proud of that I'm very very proud of that game like all around I'm just very proud of that game there's literally nothing I could about in that game at all Terminus let's keep it going shout out to the guy that renamed his account to hello rainbow Terminus so it shows up when I search Terminus Kind of a Funny move SEO optimization on top round one Terminus um I'm going Southern Vic here I'm playing this quick because cope okay how is it not Southern Vic what plates are these oh oh no I forgot to guess is this California this is no this is I don't even know anymore don't care and okay uh who what is this South Africa I guess low key this is lowkey like border down here [Music] if I could have just spent two dude why like oh my God that's so cringe I okay let's be honest I was never going this North cope I just I I just had to go wherever my first placeat opened up because I spent too long looking at the license plates and like usually if I like time out or something I would like just like restart as you guys have seen But like technically I got a guess off so like I can't even cope about that it's just a skill issue is there even a witch do f is there like a Falls here that's like popular there [Music] is that's what their city is look at this dude wait till you see the no no no no [Music] look at the top of his head oh this wasn't even Idaho it's Montana that's even more based Sula Montana bro imagine living here something tells me this isn't the right Sula Montana [Music] it's a Vibe though she loves me she loves [Music] me she loves me she loves me not she loves me oo she loves me car thieves are always in the market for no interest autol loans W ad put some numbers to how does Witchita Falls Texas have a hockey team the right hander at the top of the left wing Circle hash marks fires saved by tacus it's underneath them and he kicks that eye of the crease Ryan Cogan he gets the Whistle the right hander for the Bulls wearing number 24 in on Ryan Yuan top of the left wing Circle fires off the post and out no good this guy's got Tricks all up his sleeves here he is the left-hander Kade L top of the right Circle slow slowly around oh that was an awful voice crack from our boy the Leander for the Bulls picks up the puck drifts immediately out to the left top to left Circle hash marks fir high and wide off the glass they got put me in bro wearing number three for the Warriors picks up the puck skates off to the left top of the left wing Circle looking looking drags around shoots he's scone let's go Warriors win it in the shootout make it eight straight eight straight let's see let's see how he pronounce does the house looks kind of t Ian possibly French but like nearby so I would go like here or possibly like Catalonia but I think I kind of want to go something like over here like it feels pop Valley right I don't think it feels like Rome so yeah I'm going to see no it was French okay this one is justu I think or like here this place may be or something um yeah I think it might actually be this town like over here okay nice base guess BR just two Bros chilling five feet apart oh okay this is interesting the soil doesn't feel particularly pey to me but like at the same time it does also feel kind of peow so I was wondering if it's like bajia like over here somewhere DN again BR I think it's my maybe it's my a note to be fair should I go b or P I mean yeah I'm just like hedging to over here it was actually peruka okay never mind this is like a really weird o I guess it's like I don't know I'm trying to think if it's ever queen or like ever Darwin or just Queensland no I think it's just Queensland but I'm not sure where I'll probably go like town or something yeah that's first place what the average RC scripting moment what the heck baller here is that maybe Montana a check out I think and then turns to the landscape it kind of reminds me of near Yellowstone so I'm thinking like it did it again but you're guessing it's okay I mean you got first so I did get first now probably hold this I would go near like camber I think it's more North everyone's down there um this feels like Texas feels like Dallas maybe Houston though it was switch top falls but we will take that back in O and I would go a similar area to be honest just some there like over here and now it's more south should swao actually don't know if it's oh my god dude I don't know if it was Spade or Portugal but I went border and it worked we good we good I think I did go I went Spain I want Spain right country country right country right country it's like Kenya or something no it's South Africa bro I I didn't recognize the it's okay I thought the houses in the back looked African but what's the song of the day bro so I was thinking about the uh Kendrick and Drake Feud and I was like I was like damn they they had a good song together you know the song Poetic Justice yeah Poetic Justice that's a fing song of the day RC I like it also the uh sample is really good from a Janet Jackson song I hope everyone is ready to have a good day tonight tomorrow um let's see where everyone went and I got fifth place today um you know it could be worse round one was France con snail chumble axel self France Lots Italy those are the two I was in between um of course I called Poland and stuff like that too I think that makes sense but the house thre me for Loop last second went France round two was this like down here yeah let's see how many people got the road right here probably a couple Lenley myself RC maup and Anna congratulations lot people going Southern arge though going all across uh probably the seven there um any good guesses here gor great guess where did g he got gor got thir yeah that's a good guess Oscar Jami got Fort was oh this is the McKay I'm assuming that's uh Eddie Yeah Eddie uh Eddie trctor and RC everyone in Queensland round five what was round five oh the Montana I should learn my ballards because apparently that was a Montana Ballard um but yeah I think Colorado is a good guess I was in between col I thought it was going to be in Colorado but uh yeah everyone kind of getting this region of the us though um contest everyone super close there so well played and then on the 10 second I probably didn't do yeah I got 10th here 22 people playing here round one was no one even got like there's like a force fi around this location that's kind of funny uh Texas shout out to bag RC and Toro for getting Texas totic me and Jami coming out first here congrats the same Texas only person that get Vic was totic everyone else is going inw there so could guess by how is it actually there though that's actually kind of crazy round four what was oh is a Spain yes D 96 Bulls on top okay and then this was a z this had a couple different content guess some Brazil uh some Philippines some Europe it is like an odd uh an odd South Africa but like if it's going to be in South Africa it's going to be here with the vegetate you're like no it just looks like it um so shout out to con trior Lindley I'm so sorry consis I keep calling Linley okay consis uh Linley M Jami myself sell andna D Eddie and gor freaking zah such as life and I also dude I forgot to update the scor sheet again and I don't want to do it right now I'm too lazy um I think Oscar

"would you look at that it's another day that we all get to wake up and play the game with you yester but it's also another day to have the privilege to use your Noggin round one okay so like this is my thought process here is like this sign right here fills Italian everything else kind of fills Italian I'm going to go southern Italy here I don't know why that's just my Vib it's like something like South Bari like in this like pocket right here I mean like it's okay it's Naples round two looks like okay there's two answers this could be Spain or Romania I lean towards Romania because we have the dash IR lines we also have the white painted tree here so that makes me think more Romania what else could this realistically be don't know I'm going eastsh something like this there's like Hills northish yeah I don't know maybe something actually over here dude yeah I mean urban Russia is impossible dude wait is this Ukraine I'm gasl myself now I can't tell if this [Music] plate no it's just Russia I'm not gasl myself it's just going to be Western Russia that one of these cities I go here I mean what the heck okay Indonesia o this looks like a pole I should know like that thing that sticks out like that I actually don't know it though all right let's think about like geographically though like what makes sense here like for the vegetation I'm popping off right now I L you want to go Cali but like this isn't like it's not [Music] West is it ever t no no no no I'm gonna go C here North Cali okay that feels Gable e okay this is going to be quite difficult it looks like Norway this could be bad for your boy I'm not going to lie on a stack no KY um my score isn't really that good anymore though like it have to be Northern Norway right but wait what is this that doesn't really make sense creation no I'm kind of confused guys I'm sorry who the [ __ ] go Scotland on this if you guys remember when I spawned in though I immediately said oo that should have been the first T that this was uh Scotland or like the UK that should have been the first tail if I have that immediate gut reaction I should probably just go to the UK yeah guys this this feels like the UK like that that Hill there feels very like UK and this maybe kind of actually no no I I I'm just it's just a skill on my end to be honest more than anything why do they have to go such Why why do they have to go so North Norway though why couldn't I have gone like Oslo I'm interested in seeing the road I clicked like what that looks like actually compared to this is a road the closest coverage I mean yeah there's no trees here whoops you can see the you can see where I'm coming from though right see like this is like uh This what I was thinking right like this looks am I coping too hard right now this looks like come on you can see where I'm coming from with these trees right guys with this elevation all right enough coping let's get Terminus going as if that probably won't add more cope to us but that's okay lock in 10 seconds on the clock lock in round one okay this PHS Italian like near like this selenian border um where else do I have nothing at all oh Lord if the UK ruins a guess again is this Ireland we have a White House guys if I see a white house I have to go Ireland I'm going to UK though if this is I'm going an I thank God my internet sucks shout out to my shitty internet thank you for that Philippines why are we driving why is that car on the left okay looks like LZ on though but the [Music] Pavements okay dude I'm sweating I'm actually sweating right now maybe because it's 115 degrees outside I have to turn my AC off to film these videos but holy okay we're playing out of our minds South Africa you probably go um south of lutu here lock lock in bro lock in you're not beting the four the round four allegations you already beat the round four allegations don't let it be a round five blunder that's all I ask okay um this is thail Lane this is lowy up here you boom K I should just it's just a free Cambodia was there it's just a free Cambodia my guess makes so much sense though this is why it sucks playing country I'm coping it sucks playing countries like Ming a country for a while because then you think everything looks like that country that's just really demoralizing it's just a free Cambodia I can't even cope I can't even cope on this it's just a free Cambodia is it Northern [Music] though that's I would go I would have gone Sanctuary or something if I went Cambodia all right all right let's see however else does I would go I don't know it's like mountains all over kind of I just want to like hedge middle cuz I don't know it could be as far north as like here but then they could be like way more south maybe I'll be like that okay I don't I don't know exactly where this one is I was thought like maybe here or it could be like here somewhere wait you're like oh wow uh okay we're good we're good luckily that guess is not cut on camera this one it feels kind of Southern maybe not cross well I don't know I'll go there no it wasn't that s why is it so like dark I would have said kie I don't know I was kind of feeling like up here somewhere maybe okay it was nice I should got even more North 21 can you do something for me can you do oh wait dude you're your stream died again wait oh well it's okay you didn't have to do where I guess did you guess Norway no I guess Sweden oh okay is it working now dude why are both your bad guesses both your stream for once for once I always make the parties what the [ __ ] no I make you the parties what do you mean you want to do what map bounced no let's do Terminus [ __ ] it Terminus sure oh this guy's 1953 it's a shame I'm G take his El way imagine if you could why is there a wide blur don't know what you're talking about if this is like ah what okay I thought I was cooking how is it the Netherlands though like what yeah like actually I forgot what the thin border was I think thin was so right [ __ ] dude I'm watched I don't even know I just remember the fs Rao I literally have more points than you oh yeah you do I was like wait dude I think it's just like here D okay I thought you okay um I take L's on this R you think Kendrick or Drake won I actually haven't I mean I haven't listened to either but from what I've heard of the reception I think Hendrick definitely probably won B dude I thought about y oh my God I actually did me like hope yeah yeah now this is a nice luck oh dude I feel like like taught me a met for this but like I don't remember what it was I'm sure he didn't I'm going to disappoint my brother free anyways dude you're literally so freaking cringe multi Merchant bro actual multi yeah you can't spell Merchant without RC actually actually you can't spell dude why are you instant guessing on this what do you mean we have everything but you have like a 360 monitor what are you talking about wait what what you mean we have everything bro bro we have the black back of the side yeah that's why you g me guessing no way I get this this guy actually gets this lock on freaking when I have health I'm I'm on a 50/50 dude I don't even know like what to guess got to go for this one I think like it yeah ultimately please don't beat please don't be can I say what my other thing is no because I'm still trying to figure out where to guess you can say it Northeast exas okay it was did I just lose dude you're actually dude you should got Mississippi what can I say it's free northern Mississippi D what's the song of the day bro good the song of the day okay I mean okay seven by man I trust is a Vibe yeah is it an LR W by RC [Music] GG's RC my food is going to get here all right all right it's next day let's see how we did round one or game one 40 seconds we're coming in 16th here which I think is like lowkey like not justified like I I like played really well like how did I come in 16th because I guess North Norway like just because I didn't guess Southern Norway when no one else cope round one was it leite everyone getting that round two interesting no one getting Eastern Romania there going all over row um but yeah everyone getting Romania so that's good sign this is a Russia uh wow Buzzy with a great guess great guess by Buzzy there Blinky couple people in Ukraine all all in Russia here round for interesting everyone in Indo bag won by a thousand points today yeah North C is a great call snil and RC also North Cali lots of people in Cali Sula couple samatra round five was just at least took 7 Seconds this time you know um yeah bag the only person to get the UK there or Scotland but everyone else is uh in Norway so I'm glad that's Justified I just remember I forgot to update the dock again I'll get on the dock guys I promise cope round one or next game I got I got third on this one okay that's decent this is um a really good guess um that was a really good guess everyone going all over uh Europe there round two no one getting or like well coup people getting whs but bag and Blinky everyone getting the kind of UK Ireland Vibes though of course what was this oh the Philippines I think we had the LZ on or like that tuck tuck that's like different elevation roofs is like there and then I played really well where did I fumble this oh [ __ ] dude I went Ty on camoo that's what happened ah dude I like don't want to look at this I'm so how many points I lose by dude oh my God I lost by like 100 points bro even if I just like went like if I didn't even go like Max North like T like today's going to be a good day I'm not going to let this bother my day because you know I wanted RC to get the points anyway so it's okay it's okay I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations":

right it's another day to play the game G guys but more importantly it's another day we all to wake up and have the privilege to use our nogin round one 40 seconds on the clock let's run it I'm back we're back daily challenges are back are good guest is back we'll see but what better way to see if good guesses are back than the region guest Thailand let's go I went to the Philippines for a couple days um past like five videos are pre-recorded yes I'm bronzed tall dark and handsome what can I do about it you know all right um looks we have like rubber trees we have mountains South okay so when you have rubber trees like this um I sometimes want to go like here I've seen rubber trees like this up here in L and I've seen them like in like prong Na and like down south right of course like here um but I'm leaning towards up here and uban ratchatani was not the thought that went through my head h okay so the sun's North southern hemisphere doesn't really make any obviously I mean like if I went Northern Hemisphere on this i''d be bad um I like a crazy like African country like I mean that's just a good guess like I don't care that's a good guess let me Analyze This estin Grass of course not sure why I went listen you to on that but oh fun okay things I like shop in the Name of Love Shop in the Name of Love um yeah I mean dud it's just like down on instagam boring okay um how weird oops very weird is this kir no is this Russia yes caucus North no okay I mean what other mountain range could that be in hindsight you know all right then we have a oh man we're about to use our Noggin on this one all right okay so the road is going east west and we have this hill in the back West that looks like it could be like near like I mean the question is how far north do you I mean like it's obviously up here I don't see this being one of these roads or like cockadoo and the question is would this road be in Gen 4 now I mean it's East West and there's mountains is it ever like down here or like somewhere over here in Queensland ah we'll find out dude this is Gen four now like what is this map it's so silly I mean this Road's gen 42 I yeah this Ro is Gen 42 so I'm not sure why but I don't think it has I don't know I mean 20K is not that bad this is a fine guess I just guessed in the mountains where I thought it could be because I mean what other mountain range makes sense for mountains North and Russia free Amsterdam this one was not easy but like it's actually very Gable if you think about it like this looks very ESI um but I I see like going like a Kenya national park or something like that I just haven't seen coverage like that this is one of those things that once you've seen this coverage once you're you're never going to get it wrong again all right Terminus time let's do this hopefully we get a fun seat here let's lock in 10 seconds Terminus is uh not the most generous map to your scores so let's lock in round one okay do you go Northern Portugal Spain galsia do you go Greece you go Northern Spain Portugal like somewhere up here nice this is going to be well I think this is Kazakhstan but this map doesn't have Kazakhstan in it wait what when did this map get Kazakhstan oh dude oh my God I'm playing Terminus I thought I was playing a balanced world still I'm so dumb I'm so dumb I was like when debor has not added uh Kix San to this map um yeah I'm just going it's could be West Cali but if it's here I'm sad okay we're good um okay one would presume you go Georgia here not sure where else you go I like these Southern Pines

a beautiful day to play the beautiful game you guys here using your beautiful Noggin round one game one let's do this double lane Highway in Nigeria is this two lane yes it is okay there's not very many two lanes so I think it should be where's the other two lanes this two lane that's one lane um it feels like it' be somewhere over here though that's to Lane I'm just zooming in here looking at what roads I don't know I'm just going to stay on this road to Abuja but I think it could be somewhere Southeast okay it was just that highway to Abuja round two you have to go Ukraine [Music] here and it's summer coverage because this guy is out here flexing uh you know Suns out guns out and so I'm going to go eastern Ukraine maybe that makes sense maybe it doesn't round two three Cambodia no Brazil Rima I think this is Rima it could be acri no I think it's just Rama is this crazy Rima um I guess it could be Aur I think I like Hera more though like what if it's ever like one of these roads up here isn't there white roads up here somewhere maybe over here I mean usually in rman you'll see Hills in the background that we don't see here but so this could be a silly guess but we'll try our best here to guess somewhere like Northeast orima I mean like sure I'm not ever guessing there to be honest I'm not even sure how that's there um is this Russia or laia because like usually with like the thick red border it's usually laia right but this is a Russian sign back there so I'm going to go Russia like something I mean I'm not going I don't know how re guess this looks West Miss Miss Westy okay I'm kind of popping off right now wait what is this is this wait what city is it I should know this wait is this canaries or something actually I thought initially was like jabaz somewhere over here but now I think it's like canaries or something wait alt why am I confused wait why am I so confus wait what is this driving right Palma or like no this is a bad guess canaries is a bad guess here that's G to be something Spain wait what I mean that's just a bad guess can you see the plate oh was that dude I didn't even it didn't even look like it double blue strip on that plate uh Terminus will save us cope all right 10 seconds on the clock let's lock in and let's not go Spain or yeah Spain um southern Spain or Southern Sweden I guess um why is this crazy is that for Dr north north city Dr wait was there he yeah that was a bad guess but we'll still take that um Denmark um Germany maybe ah freck France I don't go France on that specifically this Rwanda is he updated Rwanda he has updated Rwanda wow um Eastern Hills uh I'm just going Lake here I'm sorry guys I don't know okay nice um um but yeah that was that was a good game all around I would say a good game um sorry if it's less of a boring day and no deep Dives doesn't really look like there's that much l to go on here but you to have an entertaining days you also have to have boring days C let's see how everyone else does let's see how everyone did round one Nigeria this makes sense because it's the two lane or the double divided or the divided highway going to Aja uh churcher getting that really close Blinky totic on the same road didn't wait where did I guess tootus over me you silly goose um everyone G Nigeria though too was Ukraine Southern Ukraine great guess by trior again round three was Brazil great guess thank you Anna for the validation there um couple people in Aur oron I think those are fine guesses round four was over here in uh Russia makes sense round five was oh yeah this was a crazy uh round did anyone go canaries with me no this was the guess I was thinking of in Su or something I thought could have been um Mexico's a valid guess too but yeah that's one of the harder locks I've seen in a while Palama I think I called Palma out than that yeah that's a crazy location and then for this one see round one Sweden everyone getting that pretty obvious Dominican Republic thank you Anna round three you guys know there's only two cities covered in Dr so it's only here and here um France I guess was one I got Dutch or Danish and German vibes from that um I think I saw 2023 copyri I'm being honest but Anna's in Germany with me me and Anna have had like the same guesses like he's on the border here but five people in France so good job to them and then western or just Rwanda kagali and this is cool to see like how close everyone is in Russia usually that's a year ago that would not have been the case but great guess by Trick dude tricker makes some insane guesses

right here what the actual freck I mean I can't think of anything besides Bolivia this architecture looks like bivan architecture but I don't know where this is in Bel like something over here maybe just laaz really okay I've not seen that oh interesting okay this should be Mound I think this is just mound like a free Mound H it's in east west don't really like that don't really like that at all maybe it's not Mountain it could be like NADA maybe or something up here or maybe up here it was mound okay nice I just thought that was a main road for some reason um what a beautiful location oh wow this is really really cool wait this is like such a deep photo I feel like I mean I'm not sure where it is I'm just going to click DACA but um yeah what really cool like this guy with a hay she's like walking on the bridge over like the sunset coverage like wow what a beautiful like image really really cool oh Lord okay wait Noggin time okay this is the US or Canada I think um I think you have to go Canada here okay so there's two options here A Part me thought it could be like over here in like this pocket and the other answer is like down here in near Vancouver I'm goingon to do this up here I don't know why I'm just like feeling a risky guess up here I'm one of these roads [Music] I can see someone getting that right but I can also see people going in Cana with me I hope I hope oh this is not fun oh this is not fun at all I mean when I said we have the privilege to use her Nagin like we really have the privilege today yeah I mean it's not like this road would never make sense for Russia like I could see a crazy like Eastern Slovakia or like Romania Bulgaria um yeah it feels more Mediterranean than like Slovakia though so like I'm not sure why I'm clicking here but yeah guys this is back toback two bad rounds sorry I just don't know where this is Romania okay I think I might have called Romania so that's worth something I did not even think of Greece though um that was a great location I'm sad I didn't recognize uh these are probably like iconic um like that wall that's so pretty I'm want to go to Bolivia um Mountain I recognized Bangladesh is kind of easy yeah these two I can see myself doing like a top no actually because it's going to come down to these two guesses right here and I didn't quite do well on those so that's okay though cuz Terminus is is always there for us when we needed it the most 10 seconds let's lock in it's actually probably not true it probably will make things worse Spain probably like Southern over here Croatia this brick uh crotia Monty Greece maybe Monty dude uh freck Romania I have no idea it's a great guess B gr it's fine that's fine you can't really complain too much about that what I can complain about is this gree location cuz what the heck okay there's a a little Lounge here we can let's look at the reviews I've been twice once I was managed by the owner and it was accommodation from people with basic level unfortunately because of a problem he gave the management company they turned into a broo hotel while the house was lovely and I would like to leave a good review the hostess accused us of attracting flies when in fact there was a nest in the room and when we sprayed the room was filled with dying flies he also had bugs walking on the bed I wouldn't have written all of this if the Villa manager hadn't unfairly accused us and I'm writing it here so the owner of the house can see it because we are also involved in tourism but I've never seen such bad management to accus and allegedly ask for money for extra cleaning when some people just like to yap on the internet for literally no reason I love sorting reviews by Lois though it's always it's literally my favorite thing to do the food below average the room wonderful the service amazing one star huh all right um yeah I'm interested in seeing where other people go there but we'll see oh no I always oh no no these ones are just the laaz ones I remember them don't see anything that's wrong electricity kind is rat should be the pass somewh okay okay that's very white so I think if I was making a rainbow tips video I'd call out m i don't I doubt it's Franc town so it should be something up in that Northwest region if it's m on one of these towns that goes further up here I would go M oo Bush fire coverage and this is not a safe foot path my friend it's a lot of palm trees I don't know I'm just going to when it's nice and pled I like to go near duck car tends to make sense to me like this that's okay Blinky wow what's the point difference 100 less than that's very weird with the ferns we have a tall wooden pole and the trees would seem to fit and the road definitely fits so I guess like the concern would be like Italy or France don't think the trees really look French but they could be like Italian could be Spanish maybe I think it really looks like Greece I think I want to trust it I'm more in here nice oh nice gu blink oh dude this is wait zoom out zoom out who went to us with me K Gorka B okay um I think I've seen like Ro rounds like this in Romania okay thoughts could be Southern Russia rever like that's my main three I think I like Romania the best out of them it could even be like Slovakia potentially I guess I would go like Southern Romania here in the mountains go like yeah nice I'm actually really poor at this 50/50 I'm just going to click water me the script feels like Albanian coverage I was just practicing a bunch of Albania like middle maybe okay Vin that's uh Norwegian is it not am I throwing believe no time oh thank goodness I actually wanted to click where Blinky clicked so that was lucky oh what the hell is going oh it's a Romanian pole okay okay that makes sense B and Russia snow normally Saratov or V maybe more VES to me I don't know nice just cooking o the the no was literally better than I intended so true all right let's see how everyone did this is only like after like an hour or two after me I sent the link so um I'll be unable to get everyone in here unfortunately but I'll update the scores accordingly when I'm back round one everyone G bu yet round two um laaz anyone get the exact one no round two we'll do this quick shall we was mound I mean keep in mind we only have 12 people here but lots of people getting Mound that's because of the the soil the white sand on the side of the road it's kind of really common the mound Bangladesh is DACA round four was Greece okay anyone go the US with me besides cor nope I'm glad that at least one person did that would have been more embarrassing Axel trior Oscar uh Blinky getting that all over kind of Europe here five was Romania Axel or Emily and Oscar only want to get that so far and then as of right now with only 10 people finishing this Spain kind of free Gorka nice gor only one to get Monte couple Albania couple Catia up here Serbia Italy um free what was this oh the Romania also mentioned the pole but I don't remember sing a pole there and the winter coverage uh Rush has only found here I'm sorry if these videos feel rushed they're at least the end of them I'm gonna miss my flight okay I'm

score I'm sorry well actually yeah I kind of fumbled the Bulgaria around but that's not easy yeah I played fine I played fine this is what's not fine Harper's fery Harper's fery West Virginia also has a strong case for being the most beautiful town in the entire country okay bro no first of all the like sure it's beautiful but like do not say it's one of those beautiful towns in the entire country I mean I guess the Confluence of the patomic and the shinoa river and is surrounded by Rocky Cliffs and beautiful Forest it's also approximately on the halfway point of the appalachin trail between Georgia and Maine the town itself is like walking into a living history museum it's been incredibly well preserved and parts of it reconstructed you can easily walk from one end to the it is really pretty the other but you'll probably do it multiple times cuz the town is that Scenic and that beautiful you're looking to up your Instagram game while traveling in West Virginia here are that's exactly why I went to West Virginia was to up my Instagram game Casino website bonus finder used hashtags to find the most Instagram landmarks in America and each state the ranking found that the most picturesque place in West Virginia by far is Harper's Ferry historic National Park that number one place is unsurprising as Harper's fairy appeals to almost everyone whether you're an outdoor adventure or a history buff Tik Tok famous Town wait is this town actually Tik Tok famous the small town of Harpers fery has a long history of Bloody violence and natural disasters and huh wait wait wait I thought this is like a Charming town in West Virginia the small town of Harper Ferry has a long history of Bloody violence and natural disasters earning the name of being a child of tragedy and is believed to be haunted by ghosts of its past its strategic trading location where the bomic and shanoa rivers meet between the three states West Virginia Virginia and Maryland made it an attractive prize for both sides during the Civil War and it was taken over 14 times harus fairy is teaming with ghost stories and reported apparitions including a whole Phantom Army that marches down the street the spirits of the drowned screaming Journey John Brown a murdered drummer boy and a priest all allegedly haunt The Town I'm not going there God that song actually really makes me miss the us though I'm not going to lie [Music] dude that's a great like the US scenery sometimes is just beautiful makes you like emotional and it's next to a Sandy Hook wow all right well I love Dives like that that

but I I mean it kind of reminds me of that sort of stuff yeah and if it's not Harper's Fair it's got to be somewhere nearby like somewhere like antium area or like Hancock or something I think Harper's fair is probably the most likely option like what else should it be I don't know I'm just going to send that okay nice it was it could be like that kind of uh Colonial architecture in like South Carolina or something it could be like Kentucky Tennessee as well to me we're kind of into the hills aren't I could hedge Tri point I'm going to hedge Tri Point that's fine oh Maryland oh wow no yeah didn't Channel my inner Ru hard enough here apparently dude I like watching zoom into a map is like the harest never to watch Oscar me because you're it just like loads like a single square at a time I know dude it's so I hate it here man like I hate it I also think like Chrome is kind of slow I've been experimenting with other browsers but they they only improve it a little bit so whatever like look you zoom out and like half your map is a gray box bro what CRA D you've got to leave Australia bro this is or you got to pay off to you guys or to put some servers down under yeah I'm sure showing you guys what I what I deal with that was the toonic map bro what the [ __ ] bro the toonic map that's one that's one way to call it okay let's uh not make the same mistake as yesterday's so I would say yeah I would say this one is Peru and I would go like here or something or yeah I like this actually something around here is this New Zealand ever or is it like near monkey puzzle territory n or is it what is this really wide gravel road with a pine tree is it just Spain oh I I would have checked copyright R to see about like what we were saying about the uh go here oh that makes sense a river it feels like Amsterdam to be honest is there any like yeah okay like this River would make sense yeah I'm going to send that I wasn't mrict okay that's that's tough could to be asked yeah uh we have piranha Pines nonetheless I would still go rgds here yeah I mean I'm I would just send like a central here ah it's piranha okay it's like barely any Palms at the same time though it kind of felt like Min now but without the Palms you want to go more like Central probably something like this I'm G to try that okay that's quite a tough one wait are you in first by 14 points you are or by Four Points oh my God somehow well average RC scripting less second do you know it's the most haunted city in the US really that's what they're claiming I thought there's quite a few yeah there's quite a few haunted towns out there I know like uh Savannah Georgia does like ghost tours like like the haunted what's Savannah Georgia I don't know they do I don't know yeah I mean there's like HED hotels and stuff I've seen in like Arkansas yeah did you ever go on a school field trip to HED hotel is it like no I didn't dude they made us sleep in like a haunted hotel and I was like 11 and I think that like lowkey gave me like trauma that's certainly interesting I remember they made us go to this basement and we all sat in a circle and held hands and turn the lights off and they like maybe as I'm repeating this sounds like that's traumatizing what and then they like and then they like had a chair that they like moved and then like you're supposed to like wait till you feel The Ghost and like this girl next to me started screaming cuz she thought she fell The Ghost and everyone started screaming and we all sprinted out dude like seems like a seems like a hazard Public School in Arkansas by the way okay uh fosa I think like something like or Cho I'm in Cho right now but you know what I meant okay brother north south what the hell what the where he where'd he go where'd he go you go here don't you why is it oh no it's like ooh this is like we got Spanish moss I think you have to go Florida on this one I mean it could be like actually locked in oh oh oh that's look cookable is it Florida uh could be like a actually in the mountains or something or what's your favorite flua song to honest I don't know that many that's okay like all I can think of off the top of my head is my house we're just we're just three Bros chilling around chill not too close because we ain't gay at least 5 feet apart you think people will get that surely surely man Europe Europe I don't know uh hedging Austria dude oh look at that that Cub uh okay where where where where where uh could be could be a svir I think maybe that's a hard one though [Music] um think I go like East Java here okay nice let's go I saw the uh the pull at the last second P which made sense uh window tiled roof uh don't see anything isometrical uh uh a jumie no wait it was a it was a tin roof though I said Todd but it was 10 Sweden we'll go Sweden average RC script yep duck him we did it let's go yay all right and on this one 20 people playing this one cons getting first place that is by three points conest moment round one was Harper's fairy and RC only person getting that everyone there lot of people in West Virginia here I'm kind of all over that look at this line here and let me get out um and Pennsylvania all sorry Peru RC great guess there getting the lake RC started off really really strong what happened round three and they're close was this just Netherlands yeah okay shout to Gorka for getting the bridge there think got the bridge yeah he did great 5K there by Gorka get props for props are do what was next was it the oh the pipines yeah that makes sense and then how did RC lose this where did he oh because he went rgds that's how and round five is a great guess then the 10 second is RC got first on this one we get the right Road here um couple people technically am I on the same road I'm on the same road the four here RC and con is my no one getting the three blink is close over there too everyone going north AR round two was Florida plus be looking that any really good guesses not really round three Romania or Bulgaria only trick from uh blink gting that that's really really tough round four East Java consant D and RC and that's the top three placement so that makes sense and then me and Gorka yeah no on five Sweden okay that's where I hedged Finland Sweden and a great guest there I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 11.100992790891798,

right it's another day to play the game of G yester but more importantly it's another day that every single person watching this video got to wake up the privilege of using their Noggin including you Tyler just scared someone named Tyler that was kind of fun um is this looky the Netherlands no Belgium oh you guys are getting massive forhead cam right now that's kind of embarrassing checka what what is this wait please don't clip any of that my mind was just not in the right place my mind just wasn't in the right place that looked like I knew something felt off and and it didn't it didn't hit me until like a couple seconds but it's not about how you start it's about how you finish and my Noggin was in use and that's okay what a beautiful I love South Africa um do you go like cape surely right something down here I mean I guess you could go near lutu but these Hills don't really F Lu in L Lun what's the called if you're from l l lottin ltin Lan Um mountains northon this road no it's not really I'm afraid it could be up here like near like more East a forehead cam time I mean this looks like a bike path no like what's a car doing on here bro he's actually lost I mean the obvious answer is like the UK right but it could be France I guess it could be oh you guys are getting too much Noggin right now it's getting self-conscious um I have to go to the UK here doesn't really look like the UK but like I guess it could be France but and I makes sense I saw a White House in the distance I should have used okay this will be fun what city is this with mountains somewhere one of these small cities over here I don't know which one um surely right um if I knew Russia better I'd be able to do this and guarantee Finn knows where this Ridge is go somewhere by over here it just your C [Music] dude I rage I should not rage guess that that's okay fine guess I moved away from Yakutsk that was um a game of trial and tribulation I think I didn't really make any bad guesses I mean Northern Ireland was getable because of uh this white house right here I think Yakutsk I fumbled by not just clicking yakut when it's obvious this one I actually don't think this is a very easy like Japan I'm not even going to lie I could see someone not going Japan on that per Olivia just rageed it and this one I was didn't know if it was these Hills down here or these Hills up here but uh such as life Terminus [Music] time 10 seconds let's lock in let's do this 10 seconds oh lord it's a Grassfield and what I would like to be I would like to think this is Russia like over here I mean like wa like come on um okay well this is going to be Canada I think is this ever like up here in BC like Vancouver Island uh I mean State streak um I'm going Bali here like something weird Bali ah that makes more sense that's why it was weird B uh Baltic uh freck dude oh yeah this is a nothing yeah dude what a depressing oh I mean tiles roofs is just Java right surely cope okay okay yeah dude the UK come here we have to have a talk I mean yeah I should have seen like how depressing it looked I should just guessed England we like right here right poy White Horse is this their claim to fame really wow really thrilling stuff going over here in pooy all right let's see how every else does wait is it Taiwan or Japan actually don't know it looks like we're driving right so should be Taiwan then right I've just never seen these like red and white Chevrons in Taiwan but I think it has to be no it is Japan bro oh my god there green signs over there was it Japan actually yeah they're driving right it looks like no I think it's just an exit so I don't think they're actually driving right but the everything the sign just kind of weird like am I Rumble stripped as well am I wrong here uh didn't really look like turo but I feel like that's just safe it's cookable I just have to think I want to go like here somewhere like yeah sure no wow this looks really like kutu do you get that around here maybe yeah could be could be like Northwest could be somewhere around here really don't mind that this road here good bro cooked holy insane thought Germany to be honest no it's 21 maybe Belgium then um yeah no I was thinking Belgium here could make a bit of sense we do have like a seemingly Red Brick House it could be like definitely could be uh Denmark but I don't know if the fence feels that way what about England wait it could be England here I'm going to be based oh Northern Ireland is tough though yeah that's what I said okay and then this I guess would just be I thought it was Yakutsk I think I still will go Yakutsk and I probably just go downtown because I don't know which road this would be yeah okay M could this ever be Yak y Yakutsk cuz the trees like obviously first thoughts here just someone like the bush fire coverage and here whatever but I think the trees are really spindly which makes me think it's like north of Yakutsk or something you do get some hazy stuff there man and we have heels are there are there heels like oh man I'm so no no no I'm going back I'm going back [ __ ] lens let's try it no it's not lens no oh my gosh bro I I like he called it you said north could I know what that looks like I know what that looks like lens is way too bushy and then I think this is Peru is it Bolivia maybe it's Bolivia actually yeah actually I'm going to go Bolivia here I don't know which exact Road it is but I mean okay there's yeah I don't know no it was Peru ah yeah yeah okay that road in Bolivia but obviously if it's Peru it should be close to bivia surely with this tit takaka Grass Lake Tiki what did the lingual as call it like TI Tik taka remember Tak Taki Tiki I don't know he said something dude that reminds me of takis you guys ever had Takis yeah I have a few times yeah she has a red 40 don't know about that one okay I mean you looky bro uh call me ARA something like that I think it's like ARA that would go like pretty close down to nope it's just Moscow bro what the trees look I me it's clearly Russia but I I can't read these trees that well go b or something yeah I was going to go Moscow as well but this looks like um like us like probably like Juno or something no it's oh it's Canada okay yeah I don't know I just kind of assumed it was the US for some reason only BC area it's my best bet here okay nice we even zoom in on the map I don't know kind of thought like Sula or something or tar yeah it was Lok okay uh okay okay okay okay uh bonian roof surely it's a bit flat but I didn't notice that the that's yeah yeah yeah what are these rounds bro Hungary no I don't like Hungary I don't know what it is UK wow oh Malaysia no it's Europe it's Europe oh I can't read the sign that's devious I don't actually think it looks oh Poland or here okay wellow that worked out yeah that out yeah just a East Java maybe Central like that no West Java okay and oh hella rues here they look more like sun Sund right or Java I forgot what it mean what what it is but like East Java yeah that's what I thought too well I'm still fast let's see how everyone did I got seventh place anyone get Japan everyone got Japan not everyone a couple people went Taiwan um that's valid de is is not playing his own map again um Hong Kong Taiwan Japan makes sense round two was let's zoom in here a bit uh yeah okay so shout out to Blinky holy [ __ ] Blinky got the 5K that's a blinky certified Blinky moment to in the right Road as well D trior Jami ax will G suu Vibes couple people going south your cap round three was the UK Ma

right it's another day to play the game of you guys but more importantly it's another day that we all to wake up and use our Noggin and that's exactly what we're doing right here on Bounce World round one in what a beautiful location I assume it's EA like Northern EA I mean I guess it could be Colo but it feels more Ecuadorian this pool does what a beautiful like Gorge or like Mountain wait is this Brazil I think this is Brazil why did I think it was EA for the longest time this is literally just triy point you guys were probably so worried you're were like wait what is bro cooking right now oh Lord I mean this I mean like this is impossible to guess okay so we have a road though I mean it looks like it Russia I I don't know where you get factories like this or like in Russia I mean probably a lot look at all the kemt TRS in the sky I'm just kidding guys I'm literally just kidding okay um I don't know I dude I mean hopefully this is even Russia something over here it looks dryish like southernish if you go Portugal on that you're you're not my friend anymore because you're a cheater I mean obviously that is Portuguese I can't even get over there how is that P dude like oil refineries like are impossible to guess there's like it literally just takes all the life out of a oh no dude this is impossible it's literally just okay it's Africa I think okay okay okay think think think think think my immediate thought was like Kenya National Park Krueger National Park in South Africa no X that I think it's a Kenya National Park a crazy Nigeria without a follow car or Mexico don't think it's Mexico because this Cactus is weird and this is insane I have no I mean it's if it's Nigeria it have to be like a bja or something it's not that I have no idea like no idea at all maybe it's Uganda National Park am I bad am I bad um this a texus where do I want to go here guess it's just Acura I'm I was trying to read there's anything on the signs but probably not okay that makes sense cuz it's a freaking border location like this is Indonesia I mean you have to go Central Java here like this Mount this volcano like is surely or like that mountain is like probably some over here Java okay Western Java or West Java this vegetation does not feel like Brazilian all to me though and this cacti this cacti really for a Lube because I've never seen this before Terminus let's not go Africa and Brazil twice today let's actually use our nogin for at least [Music] once let's do it I have to go like samatra somewhere like South Suma okay nice this is Canada right or is this Austria or something Freak No this is Austria or something or like Finland or Sweden or something Kon sylenia svenia how do I do that and then like miss something Austria border no just Austria B I mean you have to go Mainland here and if it's sok then so be it no actually I'm going Salk oh saw it okay this is a failure this elevation in the back threw me fur the loop you know um I mean look it's literally just like Asia Austria my guess is um speaking of Asia I'm going to the Philippines tomorrow because I was like you know I kind of want to go to the Philippines so book to Tri to the Philippines tomorrow so the next like 4 days will be pre-recorded but I will do my best to keep the quality up and I will do my best to try and get zigzag and RC in every single day so that the quality does not drop while I'm gone I just wanted to go to Philippines can you can you blame a man I'm go see some tuck tucks in water let's see uh how everyone else does Oo we got some lovely Brazilian mountains here I think lowkey I feel like I've seen this before and it's like this area over here like these this road um yeah I mean these are just really iconic mountains yeah I'm going to send this I think oh it's like next Ro over okay but yeah I would say Spirit s we do also have coffee so that really makes me feel good they kind of look like the northern ones more nice uh what is this now this is quite quite a change this feels like Coastal with these plants um and we have like this little like grass thing kind of reminds me of the Netherlands would there be a factory in the po valley though that's kind of strange I mean the lines kind of fit more for Italy though don't they maybe I'll try po valley just kind of trying something different I don't know okay Portugal that's kind of tough reminds me of that round we had the other day with the damn rer yeah I don't know why but it does uh could it ever be like I I obviously immedately thought Russia but it could it be like Eastern Slovakia or I wondered about here now I don't know if these look like Romanian Road lines the vegetation might fit though I'm I'm going try that you know could be honestly that's kind of a cook like I know what you're talking about like neod is a yeah it's like a big industrial area in that area cool yeah wow what bro this is a crazy Cactus this like this like a like an alien creature here Cactus she tells you not to worry about okay I think it's Brazil again um I would just go like somewhere generally over here I think okay nice okay big cacti o disgusting balance World location right here does it feel a little African maybe like Kenya we don't get any car I mean obviously I thought kurus out first but I'm pretty sure it's not there I don't I think I would know it if it was carusel so do I have anything better than Kenya I don't really like Kenya either I'm going to go Kenya though I feel like Kenya is such a cope guess it's like it's never actually there okay it was Brazil that makes more sense it's GH and I don't know i' probably just go Acra I'm trying to think if it's over like Kumasi no I feel like I have to go Walker on this what downtown Togo okay uh like AOW something let's not throw it here my first thought was Mexico ever Indo no it looks weird for Indo like these trees feel weird for Indo but everything else kind of feels more Indo um I'm not really sure where I would go probably just hedge Central because I don't really know okay West Java yeah D okay I'm glad I thought that one through you clutch first yeah it's fairly difficult felt like does it feel like Mexico me me it thought was southeast Asia but like I'm between like Taiwan and Mexico which is very strange I don't see enough uh palm trees for Taiwan TR like I only see one palm tree the whole round we have B okay whatever I'm going to go that one oh okay lot of people got that as well mod I was also thinking about Mexico yeah you guys have the same thought process like completely like I would go Sumatra here probably like a real or something okay nice bit of like konton Vibes to Me Maybe I don't really have anything yet damn it we had so many fake tiled RS that I just thought it would be there but it was gen 3 shouldn't have gone there tough to say I'm going to head s could be any of the nordics and I'm not really sure okay it was Sweden nice I guess it's Norway or Sweden click on the border okay A wise man once told me cie Center yellow lines let's go we take that oh wait my guess makes no sense with the pole actually it's not a West K pole but I have to go for something now I feel here maybe okay it's a good guess Slovenia Austria something like that probably Austria to be honest okay feels rather Austrian to me I would say it looks like batam does that make sense no it's Saba yeah I thought about Saba to be honest yeah I guess the PO and finally we have to concrete road A Damn it luy caught up though like you made progress yeah just needed to not blunder the first round otherwise I would have been like second or first yeah probably first yeah probably oh well I didn't recognize the lamp but I guess bag bro second in the water bro oh classic yeah nice all right it's next day let's see that is a live black lines okay I got de okay de um I got 11th Place you know honestly I'll take that this is not the easiest thing um round one let's do this quickly um yeah everyone got Brazil there um Pride more south that's okay guess anyone get really close and I got really close with Oscar there um no yeah I mean that's a certified moment for sure like I said if you go Portugal there you're actually cheating like unironically just cheating shout out to Ronaldo round three uh Brazil yeah if you got Brazil in this you're just the goat snail that's my teammate bag and RC Buzzy and tricker and de is trolling because this is his map and he picked this location okay bro get off Mexico is a good guess I actually like Mexico who was in Kenya with me just me Oscar mackam okay well that's validating that at least zigzag was there and yeah the curse out guesses with the cactus makes sense lots of people curse out Toro V Jami or to and D round Four's round four oh yeah um you got Anna shout out to Anna for getting the road there in Ghana kind the goat for that I'm assuming just Capital eror AA five uh just Indo kind of all over the place me and D just holding hands over here no one getting that close with trior getting the closest but RC still getting first trior bag oh nice bag got third place with 20 seconds averaging 3 seconds per round great job bag average bag moment honestly okay let's see what we got here what I got 15 on this one you know it could be worse barely but it could be round one also guys um I'm going to the Philippines tonight so like the next couple videos will be recorded I have the next two already edited and they both include Oscar and uh zigzag I'm trying my best to do the rest with them but if there's a couple days where it's slightly less boring please uh excuse me round one SRA lost going Kelly lot people get samatra we will take that round two thank you vay for B me I'm not sure why I thought that was at South but um Sweden nor I think I called Sweden nor last second cope but um yeah round three C uh great guess by con and bag there and bag getting uh third place again with 20 seconds get this guy all the card spot round four let see round three yeah Allo round four ringing Austria yeah because of the house and then round five was just Saba not too bad lots of CH Jami Toro

freaky in this is most ABW log okay so I've actually might know this road and I think I know this road in Gen 4 and it was this road somewhere down here dude if I could remember where this road was I would be the absolute goat it was a road somewhere I'm going to I'm going to find it without looking at it actually I've seen this is and when you turn left here it opens up and there's like it gets like very windy I feel like I remember this road where was it though it was somewhere in southern Brazil obviously [ __ ] dude I'm I'm catching myself yes dude I knew it was Gen 4 why is I forgot where this road was watch this watch this watch this oh turns right okay look at isn't this like the most beautiful thing ever I looked at this road so many it's one of my favorite roads in the world honestly I just forgot where it was so it's obviously not that good but yeah get super windy but that's that's like the best Viewpoint I'm not sure why de doesn't have a panel ID but look at this it's really really pretty really really pretty Road I actually tweeted this out um like two years ago probably I'm beating the no and re alligator a at least because I just didn't remember where that repeat was um all right I mean this looks like Brazil again but that looks like it could be a short plate which would then send me to Mexico but like I still thinking I want to go sou Brazil no I prob cdmx here lucky we got blue car and everything yeah it's just cdmx all right oh this is interesting because this is like these IR lines don't look that long but I mean it's just going to be Norway surely it's not Sweden um [ __ ] I can't believe I forgot where that road was that's actually so frustrating this looks Southern AF like actually like down town like somewhere over here yeah okay and then round four we're not going to Fumble round four at least well I mean country-wise we could get a bad region guess why is there an antenna on this Gen 2 car wait no this is Mexico oh my God D I almost went South Africa dude what was I thinking did I say South Africa out loud I hope I didn't I mean I did after that after the fact my brain just immediately went to South Africa I saw Gen 2 with this like climate um yeah northern Mexico mountains South maybe it's like closer to Monterey or something but it looks more West like it could be like weird Baja or something so I'll go here in Chihuahua oh wow I never go there what does this look like in New Gen coverage this road isn't covered again actually really this Road's only been covered 20 years ago like what D Dey would find the only road that looks like this that has never been covered again in like literally 15 years also I feel I remember there being like the antenna meta somewhere North up there but whatever bro uh Urban Europe with winter coverage is not very fun because then it's just like a Rel light of like czechia Hungary Bulgaria but this looks like it could be czechia winter um could be hungry winter sure I think I lean towards cheia though yeah I lean towards Che here I mean well it's going to be it's not really bu these houses aren't really Bulgarian I could see it being weird hungry no let's just chcka let's just check you hope look at this I tweeted this August 30th 2022 so look at this road in Brazil with this link this is the same exact road we were just on see it's a it's I mean it's a pretty iconic Road I mean there's people up here on the top taking photos here so it's honestly one of the coolest roads in the world if you ever have a chance to go to Santa Katarina I mean look there's people up here taking photos yeah I mean look at this that's so cool oh my God riding a bike down that would be like heaven bro fixing his hair for the street car that's kind of crazy all right let's lock in on Terminus 10 seconds you guys already know the Vibes we're here to hopefully get a good score on at least one that wasn't that that was kind of a boring seed so okay us Southern us Kansas City Missouri Philippines Philippines again nice oh this is not easy just I mean it's just a for is Austrian or I guess we just go Austria here nice that's a great guess I mean this is a good I've played well here um yeah and this is where I don't go to my continent I think Mexico and South Africa is the only thing that comes to mind and I just have to go Mexico because I don't know okay nice I played that really well I mean I can't be mad I messed up my round one US guess reion guess Mexico bad because I clicked in the middle of a [ __ ] CD Max but I didn't know I thought it

retiring in excelsor Springs Missouri what the [ __ ] is Steph Curry doing in excelsor Springs like it's really cool that they're doing like active shooter training but like the fact that you have

riding dirty trying to kiss me riding dirty trying to kiss me riding dirty trying to kiss me riding dirty trying to kiss me riding dir shout out to exceler Springs Miss man let's see how everyone else did single yellow we don't have like a Guatemala back of the car but it looks kind of Guatemalan so okay is this just Mexico I mean the uh curbs kind of look you know South American style could be theoretically Peru or something I'm struggling to place it in Mexico I was it could be Europe to me or something else in entirely or southeast Asia even I'm going to Mexico I think that's the best like idea I had here this is a crazy round though okay yeah yeah yeah single yellow line between the mountains I thoughta looks like something I've seen but what okay Southern Norway dashes look fairly long only somewhere really quite South yeah that's a great guess trolling on the line it's Norwegian lines bro I I was like I don't know okay and it's a bit suspicious to me like I'm wondering about like gu or even like pbla here I think Gro has quite a lot of gen too I could honestly see it being grow here it's it may be more likely to just be it's a lot of gold and Long Grass well I think I will actually go further north here quila something like that I know it's it's like a golden grass state right it's like one that's really known for that so I'll try out here I don't this looks really familiar like I feel like I've totally seen this road before I know I'm feeling something up here no was Guerrero I mean gentu I think the houses would fit for my Croatia idea they certainly could be French we don't really have enough to kind of make up my mind properly I like croaa on the uh Slovenian border right there okay hungry sure is this czechia or hungry I mean I don't see anything but I'll go check you I think I was hungry so quite South oh it's really hard we have like a super pale Road I associate that with like Kentucky Tennessee a bit on no definitely European trees to me I think I would just go Austria Slovenia okay difficult decision here I think it's I think it somehow looks like this area okay why is my three seconds bro what is this is it no it's Mexico I didn't even have time to look at it scuffed dude I got trolled like I didn't even get to look at the sun angle or anything like I could have gone Mexico on this all right so next St let's see how we did no points for your boy but that's okay 25 people finishing um de where did Dey guess in the he is just clicking Chad every single time okay Dey imagine if he ever won doing that that would be actually it's actually not that farfetched I'll turn AC off because I know the white noise is bad round one Finn is the goat um and he probably knew that before too but also didn't know and Ziggy and myself getting that no one else knowing that road I guess I for some reason I thought that was a more popular road but I'll take a repeat that's like the only time a repeats ever benefited me I think cdmx I'm glad other people validated me in South like South America because dude that's the thing I keep doing is I keep saying it's because you say lat am and like you guys are like Latin America lat am he want to say South amm why not South PM round three uh also I would get uh RC back on he's in Discord but he's currently I'll show you guys he's he's currently doing a Pand quiz and I'm not one to bother a man doing a Poland quiz because if you're doing a Pand map quiz you obviously have deep rooted something okay um totic is 5king the road somehow what okay everyone getting no there round fourt I thought Blinky was in chat for a second four was okay yeah wait who is that that's not that's wait that looks like Blinky bro who's that's oh it's Planet Pierce dude I thought that

right it's another day to play the game G guys but more importantly it's another day we all get to wake up and have the privilege to use our Noggin round one at balanced World which is where we will be using that Noggin and this is a really interesting location and I have a couple thoughts here the road right here this small Road feels very Taiwanese but this does not feel like Taiwan therefore is it penu or kimin I think I go kinman here and if it's pangu I'm sorry it's an east west I'll go somewhere North up here on one of these roads it's pangu you can't win them all round two boring okay lock in okay this will be fine oh Lord I mean this okay okay wrong continent incoming why do I think this was a us for like a Split Second I just really thought this was a us for some reason I I I couldn't tell you why I think I have to go us here like somewhere like is it ever Ozarks even no [Music] why am I the man that I am is it ever Ozarks nah sometimes I I genely think I don't deserve happiness is this is this a Canada or the US that feels like this feels like low key like student housing or something for like a college I should be North surely I might just go like like somewhere over here in hedge like because it could be it's not New York but like it could be like Michigan or Wisconsin or something okay was Montreal I mean I got Canada uh the coping today is on another oh Lord just give me an could could you not have given me like [ __ ] lutu like Paris you're giving me okay my immediate thought is this road right here though do I just send it okay little more West that's fine d dude I'm so sad that there someone make a compilation of rainbow calling the 5K and then not guessing there like is that a cope I think that's a cope pangu 50/50 Ozarks called that Northern I mean yeah whatever and I'm not even like where even was this in Arkansas Bullfrog Valley like you don't even deserve like a deep deep dive all right let's move our game over determinist shall we listen even if I have a bad game I will make sure it's a good game because I had the privilege of use my M again and that's a glass half full kind of pressure taking today on termin this lock in ah [ __ ] this game yeah I'm just not getting this right [Music] sure Spain Italy uh Spain Italy Portugal I only can think of Spain or Italy Portugal Sue how about I sue is this Eastern Russia somewhere over here on this one of these roads um sure that's a good enough guess where is the river there don't know that's a road someone will know though for sure but I will have a guess because I haven't seen that room before therefore I'm the goat just kidding um yeah and what I'm about to do I'm about to go like Colo on like a crazy location that's like wrong continent surely right nope it's just Southern Colo and uh no idea I thought that was English did that sign that say fall K is maybe not the best guess I thought that was laddin and I thought it said fall on it for some reason I like how did I read fall act D [ __ ] the ACT [ __ ] standardized tests all my homies hate standardized tests specifically me don't let those test Define you if you're out there in high school the test does not define you you define yourself uh yeah let's see let's see how everyone else does maybe it's a bit much elevation for penu County though like I don't know if pengu county has any Hills maybe the far ones could have it I don't know I think this could definitely be this these islands though that's maybe more likely something like one row that actually fits here I'm going to leave it there no uh concrete okay what is going on here concrete road danglish the trees definitely look us and then we have Hills so I guess it would be like Missouri Arkansas then so we literally like ozox or something but it's like kind of looks a bit further south I don't know I'm just going to leave at Arkansas not too sure okay nice well that's good that's good that's good is this Arkansas it feels like arkans on of me but I might be wrong let's bro you're doxing me what the [ __ ] cter Bridge okay what's Aransas at it could be an Ontario plate I don't mind the Ontario idea it's probably better than anything else I've got right now oh no oh no El got it so I guess it's yeah but I really could have gone there like the more I looked the more I thought could back yeah I mean I know it's Canada just uh not sure if it was on onario or something else and I actually don't know if there's any there might be a meta here but I don't know I'm just going to go Toronto okay yeah I whisle back I thought about it but I think it's here pavement fits trees seem to fit and I think it would be like this peninsula maybe maybe it could be this road it's kind of healing okay we see heals to our South okay could be oh Blinky got me if I 5K maybe I could have overtaken him there I know there's like some New Finland coverage like Max North but I think it's just old Norway coverage with like updated copyright yeah nice gu all right well casual first place I guess I'm surprised I got first place to does that have G four do the other one I don't think it does does does kman no just okay so you literally just have to click pengu yeah yeah you have to click pengu oh I hate these I hate these what are we looking at huh I guess just go Philippines in case cuz it was there last time it was stupid [ __ ] I mean is yeah oh gosh is this like a lab one based guess wait that's actually such a based guess though with the with the blue Barrel yeah with the blue oh my God I thought I was cooking do not recognize this house ever Denmark Maybe holy I actually don't know what this is is a PO or something making the same guesses as me shame it's like near is it like here okay decent okay this is like here somewhere I'm not sure exactly where no never mind very Sandy which I don't quite understand I I guess it's just you know I could have caught up there but you could have then I don't know uh I think I'll just hedge middle here because I don't know okay yeah good now I'll get called that on Reddit for uh only knowing some countries bro I don't know I still I still think Lavan is a good guess here yeah laban's pretty valid like these trees really souy stage all right bro it looks exactly the same what you mean all right the cope is here we'll see it the C is here like look they got okay first of all we got the trees we got the trees and then in the next 20 seconds there it is right there I see look the whole yard is made of blue barrels oh [ __ ] yeah they are let's compare to the to that round I don't know man they they look pretty similar I would say I don't know bro I mean in 10 seconds sure I I stick by my guess it's a good guess it's a good guess it's a good guess me personally I knew the exact shade and I could tell the shade was off so that's why I didn't guess there like this guy that's the one that's the one Carnival was played at which party the Tik Tock R

pedestrian two trees what didn't even add a bike path or anything like the [ __ ] they just added lights like you just added [ __ ] Twilight lights like what the [ __ ] pedestrian friendly is this the bare minimum now I guess they removed parking which is fine but like at least like make a bike path or they turn this into a bike path all right it was a day full of ups and downs but that's the game of you guys here if I got everything right this game would not be as fun right cope let's see uh let's see how everyone else does the roofs are like way too shiny for Indonesian roofs you see what I'm saying I think Thailand can work yeah please don't be something stupid know what it is what that looks a bit uh Romania to me here I think maybe Delta area bro that was clearest gen 3 ever what was this guy talking about that's like the third time you've done that today is your saturation on your monitor back up or what's a I don't know what's causing me to get that wrong today it works it works go for it yeah okay catching up slowly I don't think it's us I think it's almost certainly Canada if it's North America Ontario second thought Quebec otherwise it's something gy oh nice it's a Ford Falcon those cars are only in Australia um where would this be though so the New South Wales would be the obvious choice could be Vick oh what oh oh what am I doing uh in here somewhere not too sure

right it's another day to wake up play the game with you guys sir and have the privilege to use our Noggin round one please revoke my privilege I don't want to play this game anymore okay I mean it's Australia or I mean it's it's Australia obviously the question is do you go W or do you go Darwin I mean there's water North which would like if it's Darwin the red soil is weird it would have to be like one of these roads up here right do I commit Darwin here I mean I'm already committed it could be wall but uh I'm committing here dude I was moving up there oh my God that's actually so findable dude why am I coping I got really good score but that's so findable dude if I zoomed in I could have 5K the parking lot [ __ ] dude God I'm going to cope someone's GNA find find that that's okay oh my God the seed's actually cracked I'm going here okay well if it was there it would have been okay what is this this is not easy Urban Europe is kind of not fun I mean it looks Turkish right you have to go Turkey right what is this white thing in front of us though like what is this is this a wall a house an Overexposed Dam like what am I looking at architecture feels Turkish I don't see any water tanks on the top though is that red thing right there potentially a Turkish flag hanging from someone's roof maybe do you go like downtown like Batman here what are you do here oh my God yeah I don't know how's that European turkey I mean it was turkey that's fine oh my God I'm coping dude I'm actually dude this map actually tilts me okay lock in these fencing looks Brazilian is this ever Mexico no it's just Brazil surely right oh Lord if this isn't Brazil I'm gonna have a like an actual like hissy fit wait no this isn't even South America wait this house in the back looks European wait I have no choice but to go to Brazil here I'm sorry guys okay why did the house in the back look so weird am I what the [ __ ] we're oh my god dude this has got to be actually a [ __ ] joke I'm going Mexico somewhere down here I have no idea though it could be like guala or or like Costa Rica or something too but I don't know what maybe guessing right here in the Caribbean is my best guess to be honest if it's like somewhere over here I mean like honest like what do you want for me if I'm be honest like you just had to like like what what the [ __ ] is this de like what the [ __ ] why would you put this in the map bro certified de moment okay bro all right 10 second Terminus enough of that let's lock in deep breaths this is like one of those cities in southern Chile cute dog by the way go too Santiago really is it really that North uh Greece is my best bet here I guess I go norn gree wait is this Thailand non how is that Paya what this Brazil wait what South okay and then what you do France is the only answer here I can think of if it's like Ireland then so it or Belgium yeah I mean I saw that one coming now this is actually crazy how the [ __ ] is this Paya what I'm honestly out of anything today I'm more upset at 5K Darwin yeah all right [ __ ] dude let's see uh let's see how everyone else does oh fun one does like this stuff ever look like that like it looks like we might be near a fairy you know that's North Ocean could be oh W it Beach yeah is yeah fairy terminal I think it's like somewhere like this kind of feels like a holiday spot maybe somewhere like that okay yeah looks like molter to me oh we're balanced world I keep forgetting yeah yeah it's just going to be base locations only huh oh it feels like we're on a okay I was going to say Italian island but we don't have double blues uh we got like the Turkish pavement uh it kind of feels European or like North Coast maybe but like that's very difficult to get a proper vibe off just apartment buildings I feel what about these maybe these don't feel so nor that's difficult to make a right decision I'm going to go there oh not too bad not too bad okay oh we had the exact same fences in in yesterday's videos these Brazilian ones and they were in like carara or something like that Bia I think B's pretty decent though that's just something in this big area I hope I make the right decision oh no CR you call the CR fences bro maybe that's offence maybe that's offence though oh my gosh Dee you [ __ ] is okay we see something to our Southwest I I first thought's Bermuda it kind of looks like Bermuda water Southwest where would we be maybe I don't really think so oh my gosh I don't think I have anything better than bero oh what we have mountains oh it's certainly wrong BR yeah this actually just frustrating I'm just going to go I don't care wait it looks too crappy for Bermuda Brazilian island ever no I I don't have anything oh my God how did that many people get Philippines wait what that's ridiculous bro okay this is like downtown maybe maybe slightly South we'll do that nope it was downtown it was slly South okay yeah is this like Max like no no it's not I'm like here okay what is this it's like here or something no it's Thailand why is it just rgds probably don't look at my gu that's okay this is an interesting stone wall oh Belgian stone wall that makes sense actually yeah g I wonder where zigzag went on round four bro got bro be me with this guest that's crazy oh I went Thailand another zor is a funny we had look we had those flowers bro look I know I know I just fixated but Jami went there with me oh yeah hes but you can kind of see it like in hindsight it does kind of no like I I can I can certainly see it yeah if I like lost all my vision like without po if yeah if you if you if you like squint and guess in 0.1 seconds then to be the you if you squint and you miss these piranha PES there's a t oh yeah there's one yeah seen him miss it cuz it's like right behind the palm tree Oscar just knew this is downtown Bangkok he's the goat easy one for me I don't know how you guess that cuz it's like Mountain but I just had no idea D sometimes bad guesses are good guesses and that's just the name of the game you know the fact that it was a blue car that's kind of I don't know I feel like was the car even visible yeah it was yeah that's that's one of the main reasons I went Mexico is cuz it was a blue car all right it's next day and wow that is a lot of black lines dotted everywhere so let's see how everyone did shall we round one Australia Darwin tons of Darwin couple Queensland I'm surprised W there like Perth but like Brisbane Sydney makes sense um construction sorry air conditioning sorry it's literally 9:00 a.m. and it's 95 degrees outside I'm doing what I can anyone 5K this mackam 5 this shout out to maol round two oh my God so many noises round two was oh this was uh Malta yeah boring round three turkey no one got European turkey or I guess couple close uh did where's my guess at who guessed with me wait where's I'm not selected that's embarrassing I okay um yeah coup people South down here with me based if blink is there I they go but a lot of people canting turkey around Fort what was this oh this was North dude thank God people like agreed with me that this looked weird like this is like such a weird dude this map dude dead BR is just guessing Greenland like I get he wants to see like dude the construction I'm sorry guys scuffed we're trying uh yeah I mean that makes sense that and round five was I mean how did that this many people get the Philippines like that's just golf clap for that one actual goats um but yeah no one I guess RC and Oscar are kind of in this region of the world a lot of people in Europe Indonesia and then the 10 second let's see I got on this one can you guys hear that tapping oh my god um okay Santiago dude this is audio so scuffed too was Grease a lot of people getting close here tricker great guess coule Italy round three what was round three Thailand oh yeah this is a crazy shout like going Downtown Bok and I mean yeah it's clearly it's just North clearly it's just North cope with that Gen 4 like burning season coverage I always go north there lots of people went moreth South here but Brazil Santa Katarina makes sense I think this was one Oscar and Jami went Azor on because that flower and then round five was uh Belgium but lots of people in France Belgium close enough all right shout to Anna for getting first place getting three axle getting two and Jami getting three and then for the 10 second we have Axel Axel popped off today five trior getting 15 that's good for trior and Emily is getting two um yeah I mean that's a great for tricker he's uh takes a lead there on Terminus with 15 points so shout out to him and I'll see you guys with hopefully no construction ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 11.903871987070115, "lng":

right it's to play the M GS but more importantly it's under day that we all get to wake up and have the privilege to use our Noggin and we're switching to 4C map to bounce world it's a handpicked map made by De that I would consider probably the top two hardest map in the game of you yester that most people probably don't play because it pisses them off too much so what better day to what better way to prevent coping than to just cope with everyone else the average score on this is 11,000 let's lock in 42 a you it's not about how you start how you finish Bounce World lock in use your nogin round one South Korea this literally looks like I'm going to find this this literally looks like one of those forests in North Korea one of the treer in North Korea I'm not even kidding this looks like that trucker like these trees look like that so I'm going to go in where the right person wi pong Chang and South Korea the for I'm talking about in North Korea is literally like over here somewhere I'll find it CU it literally looks those trees looked exactly the same all right round two um okay Vos is Dustin double white snow coverage not Norway okay we're gonna have to really think about this is it nor is Austria yeah this is bad I guess you go Norway here like but like where what is this like it's not Northern Italy is it is it actually Northern Italy Austria okay I'm glad it switched last second it was just Austria this long what the [ __ ] this long year be in or whatever long gear does the compass work here it's one of these streets wait I'm going to try and find East West it's not the main road here is it this road isn't covered oh gu I go up here nice 5K we will take that and then okay lock in is this Shri Lanka or Cambo or is this like Shri Lanka or like Northern like Cambo or like Tai oh no this is not good this skinny Road feels more sh but like these houses in the back don't really feel like sh and like this pole I can't tell if this is tie this doesn't really look like Thailand dude [ __ ] the roads feel so Shri Lankan that makes so much sense while I was so confused that's getable that's very getable that makes it's just vnn I I haven't had a vnn lock in so long I completely forgot it existed okay that makes so much I'm not even going to cope on that because that just makes so much logical sense God the things I would do for Gen 4 L Lo in this is uh how far south do I go like here is fine probably Max South okay I mean that was kind of bad I mean this was a fun seed though I think this is a fun seed the osri was a really cool location the an I forgot South Korea was free um and then yeah I got the 5K there which is pretty free though but um yeah all right 10 second terminus if I can type all right I've been doing well these so no time for the chat time to just lock in here time to just lock in uh yeah I'm just going to collect mrid feels oddly Southern I guess Kentucky Fair oh Lord okay this is a dirt field France czechia Slovakia Ukraine Russia France czechia Slovakia yeah I have no idea what this is sorry guys don't expect a good guess sure um Serbia Northern Ser or Southern Serbia Croatia Croatia dude I have no idea what I'm guessing here check it I guess broken clock is right twice a day type thing um this Brazil guess so but like what mgds is crazy there um fine day I mean I'm [ __ ] up my uh Kentucky and my Brazil guest there but the rest is getable I think Park City looks pretty boring in here in park seity I'm not going to lie they have like three cemeteries one two wait one two three four cemeteries is that normal for a city to have four cemeteries of that size five wait it's all cemeteries wait am I tripping why is there so many cemeteries here wait is that normal I feel like that's that's not normal no all right let's see um how proun does yeah I mean like here somewhere okay Austria Italy think if there's anything else like surely it's not Poland right okay this just Austria okay which one is this dude I literally cannot remember is a Greece fjord think maybe no wait it was swart bro I my god dude it's actually I actually hate swart who throw back to to that one swoard round you know this maybe yeah okay dude this is actually a free seed that's crazy more s okay well Toro 23 Second Place Toro Toro [ __ ] wait is he GNA get his first points dude he actually will let's go Toro W all right it's next day let's see how we did this was 20 people finishing this one this was the aw's first seed and yeah what did I get I got 12 honestly not that bad I think I messed up a Brazil guess or something here round one everyone getting South Korea free and boring did and where did Anna go in South Korea Let's see we have to call Anna okay Anna did not get the right region W I'm just kidding Anna okay um Austria okay I'm glad I didn't go Norway that would have been a very embarrassing line there but Northern Italy we'll take it Ziggy Lenley myself Gorka Toro great guess with Mack him totic and dude gor has been popping off also does anyone know what this means in Spanish Villanova Ela G don't know I'm assuming that's uh means something hopefully something not vulgar okay round three was uh longan any five kers a lot of five carers totic uh myself V de probably well de doesn't count why is De playing his own seed this guy I'm taking his score off he just wants to see the locks that we get I I guess it's fair but he knows all the locations okay and then he guessed wrong on the last one on purpose okay buddy this guy at least don't finish like okay a couple yeah a couple Greenland but that's fair round four uh what was this oh this was loud dude okay this is where I messed up yeah sh Lanka Is So based on that um Lots people getting loud here that makes sense that's one of those things where like as soon as it happens you're like oh but you like when is the last time you've had VNT unlock and Jer it's been like you just forget that's why ABW is based keep your mind freshh cou Thailand can't V yeah it's funny that's funny um and then Norway yeah okay all right and then on the 10 second I got fifth place out of 24 people playing and yeah let's see what happened dude Gorka what is this guy eating dude actually the Spaniards are on top right now okay wait I think Blinky got like a 245 on that last SE too I forgot to mention that but that guy kind that guy's kind of cracked um dude the World Cup in September is going to be insane all right um everyone getting Spain I'm assuming Gorka got really close I mean he's definitely the best Spain player like in Spain like at Spain but like that's just next level like brother like okay round two is where was round two oh it was the US Kentucky conas and who's that Eddie in Kentucky that's great kind of all over the place there in the US I'm the only one they got czechia yo this is a crazy line that's a crazy line yo that's actually an insane guess and then round four I didn't get checky yet lot of Sakia but Hey listen you can't win them all I think there was a soak pull oh also on the I realized on the ustra round in the first one I think there was like a green Austrian sign in the background I missed and then Brazil no one got mgds here right Blinky getting three Gorka getting two and Toro wait Toro is the last person or the only person that has never had a point on any season at any point and after eight on season eight he's got his first point everyone W Toro in the comments W Toro he's done it Gorka gets eight on this Eddie gets two and Blinky gets 13 and the 10-sec one's actually kind of close uh tricker Blinky and Oscar tied so that'll be interesting it's first a 20 and yeah this is a nothing Burger so far but ABW will make it really fun so we'll see and I'll also see you tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 47.25155675055619, "lng": 13.509091529613341}, {"round": 2, "lat": 37.88252129582072, "lng": 127.5516162397662}, {"round": 3, "lat":

would you look at that it's another day to play the game of J but more importantly it's another we all get to wake up and use are freaking Noggin round one 42 Terminus lets everyone lock in and use their nogin on the Saturday shout out to everyone out there that celebrates this beautiful day we like to call the weekend is this Thailand AC is not good for Content because it's white noise good whoa that bird okay what else could this be see my brain and me like thought it could be like something like this up here in Northeast Thailand um because of these Tre scatter or these cluster trees right here then I was like okay it's like South amm why did I just say that that's so cringe like that doesn't make any sense South like South America um Brazil Malaysia do I go Malaysia on that if I have another guess quite frankly I do not we're off to an amazing start here why did I ever decide this was a good map okay okay let's look at the architecture we got tiled roofs that you would like resemble Spain Italy something like that this water counter is like interesting it looks more lat America is it for like Uruguay no it's like definitely Italy or something is there Shutters on the what the [ __ ] is that I mean like sure and then you give me a freebie like this I'm just going to cook like okay that is actually insane this ash yo you guys remember that brand isn't there a brand called Ash like Gap but it's like ash I hope this is Ash now I guess it could be Bish K but I think it's just ash it was just ash do you guys know what I'm talking about was it Ash or is it Gap and it was like a brand by Gap that's called Ash I remember having a hoodie and I was like six it said Ash on it am I coping okay lowkey is this Eastern Turkey we have okay so let me talk through my thought process here we have these like tiled roofs which is like Eastern Turkey not Western turkey or like these like tin sheets it could be like weird Bulgaria but I don't think you get this Roofing in Bulgaria do you I mean the two-story house kind of make sense for Bulgaria does anything here make sense for turkey don't know North turkey would be my guess I have a legitimately zero idea where in Europe This is though besides there Romania maybe makes sense [ __ ] dude oh West turkey you know like 19,000 points but every single one of those points were earned like they were all earned I mean that Italy guess was just amazing I mean not really because you had the architecture kind of that's a free Finland Ash is just like I'm the goat this is never Malaysia well in theory it is Malaysia because it's you know in Malaysia but like I'm coping but that's Terminus for you so let's run back on 10 seconds now hopefully we can do something a little bit better but that I think that was actually a good game like all things considered that could have gone way worse now let's do 10c ter this and lock in uh Colo is that Lithuanian Ballard and then this would be Eastern Lithuania but it looks like Ukraine oh my God calling out Eastern Lithuania is insane lowkey Northern bajia [ __ ] Siara okay that's fine uh the US is my first guess here I could see myself I can see this easily being Europe but I'm going to go somewhere over here it's just a forest yeah I mean what are you going to do about it it's either a random Northeast US Forest or it's an Austrian forest and there's nothing you can like there's just like it's just one of the one of the two this is going to be is water West I'm 5K in this IO man I mean sure that was fun dude this looks so American like what like 10 out of 10 times I go to the us on this like why does all these Town names here sound like they're like the like the th and Ferb like villain doin smch or whatever like the uter Peters dworf like what the [ __ ] is going on U's Peters Dorf this is in Peters dorf where they're getting lit in petersdorf music Val in petersdorf why does inter Peters dworf like music yo okay get it okay get it I [Music] guess me and the boys when we we get a fortnite victory Royale why does this city is this UT puror mean something else why does this city only like music I'm so like like what this is like what is happening in this video I'm being trolled does un pf mean something besides the city name it has to this can't all be from the same people in Austria or there's like the musical like they're going to produce Beethoven in five years at this rate like what the [ __ ] all right man shout out to everyone that Ines Peter door out there repping The Good Vibes let's see how every else does I think we I think the car's driving right which is funny because it looks more like Thailand go it's here here okay what the heck 2021 that's interesting cuz I was thinking South AFA here but I guess it can't be Mexico Spain electricity kind of doesn't look Mexican I'm thinking this is Spain actually kind of goofy there Argentino I guess is possible yeah no no no the sun the sun would say no okay I'm going to go here think actually might be uh what does it go sunny I think it be a maybe is ever uh Romania I'm just wondering with these like exposed red bricks okay maybe you're Romania you only live once oh nice guess by tra that is an insane guess how you get that region of turkey even that's even am I I don't know okay I think maybe okay good it's a tough one GNA go here I think dude is so North y this is quite a lock no I don't like buium yeah I mean I should have gone for that in the first place and then this I'm going to say it's like here oh dude Island man makes so much sense all right it's the next day and it's slightly late because I woke up late and then watched the Garcia Devon Haney fight okay deal with it okay I'm sorry it's late 20 people finishing Terminus 42nd I got second we'll take that round one did anyone get Malaysia cons and bad got Malaysia that's very impressive um everyone else going kind of all over the place Brazil Thailand Lots in Thailand here Philippines other places in Indo round two was Italy I'm like very proud of this guess like what the hell is that great guess is by Toro Buzzy Conant there inome uh me and Sardinia getting Italy too but um yeah bunch of Spain guessers too Mexico zah chile all make sense uh Ash probably we got yeah and the round five was just turkey and only me and uh trior got turkey what a great guess by trior I don't know I don't know I was very confident being North well I knew it was Northern turkey but I thought it was going to be East with the roofing but I guess you can get that West too but whatever bro and then on the 10 second was not as good of not as much of my day as I got 18th Colo everyone getting col round two uh Lithuania everyone getting I think I people getting Lithuania Brazil North great guess by totic wow and that's Emily yeah EMily doing well there but everyone getting Brazil pretty obvious thank you me thank you thank you my thank you me no one get Austria though so yeah I mean czechia

let's go elim it was close so we'll take that okay we have Brazil ladder pole oh looks amial but like something like this maybe is it ever Rima no acri no could be accurate I guess no ronia maybe or something or is it just like over here in like Goos sure why do I do this what am I looking at is this South Africa or is this Kenya is this like crazy Kenya coverage nice okay that's a good guess and what the heck is this AR what the sigma oh okay so we have water East surely this is like somewhere like this right I'm not sure what else this would be I think I 5K AC turn off oh I was so wait where was I was I down there ah dang it oh man I messed up my first my second Brazil G when I literally called it and I was too big of a scaredy-cat to go anywhere in my life I'm literally just stuck in this NeverEnding hamster Loop of unsuccessful failur Ness because of this unsatisfied guess and [ __ ] in Brazil my second round I will never Mount to anything and I'll forever be the guy that missed round two because he can't commit to anything in his life I'm not going to let that bother me I'm just not 10-second Terminus we're gonna we're going to move on it's a good day it's a Friday keep the Vibes high and let's not cope on one round 10 and 40 second because how is that samatra I'm even been proud get Indonesia there but how's that samatra like Call's actually an amazing guess I don't know that street I'm just going to go like somewhere over here okay what is this Borneo wait what is this Sab wait what am I looking at wow that was a great guess like all around for like the end of a like a CAC that's an amazing guess would you throw it all away was this Italy Spain Greece Spain Greece turkey turkey Spain [ __ ] Portugal this is Greece like a Greek island I'm just going to click over here I did not mean to get the the right Greek island there but okay this is like a fun thing I like to do in Portugal do you think I need honest answers is Portugal wait is this port dude Spain's a great guess I'm not even mad at that that was actually a really good game all things considered Focus do you think the person living where what house in this house right here do you think everyone in this house knows who Cristiano Ronaldo is I've had this Tob before on this channel or at least on my main channel on the tournaments but I'm convinced that there's a less than 100% chance there's a less than 100% of people living in Portugal that know who araldo is and I all my friends are like oh no everyone no guarantee you some grandma or some kid somewhere does not know who Ronaldo is what was in New Zealand listen to it it's so beautiful that's actually so am I supposed to have known about this probably I go there's always a guide it might not how cool what a cool spot yeah I mean fine day let's see uh how everyone else does yeah I'm going to say it looks like um wait wait wait I actually want to try like here that was more okay dude this could be like Amazon or it could just be like Coastal Bay or something yeah it's just Amazon bro ah then you got Kenya this is like here ly little more North wait what is this this is quite the lock it's a pre- location it is why is this like low keyia trer but it's not and is that like a I'm trying to make out what this pole is and I'm not sure okay 5 Guess okay okay [ __ ] on your Brazil your second round oh oh my go and I I should have gotten Amazon all right so next day let's see how we did this one I did pretty well on let's see how everyone did where every went round one only person to get somatra is Buzzy and people closest were in Malaysia C sui tons of Philippines not sure what the heck that is Philippines is probably a better guess than samatra if I'm like that was an insane location okay round two New Zealand uh great great guesses there by a couple people a couple South Island guesses round three was uh Saba four people getting Saba lots of going Salk there out of the hill I just click Saba what was this this was Portugal getting Portugal there is kind of impressive Blinky trctor who's that Dey what happened to D's Avatar Toro aan and snil great guess Italy Greece yeah and then round five was the Greek island everyone just Toro got the island we will take take that just realized I did the 40 second or the 10 second first and D popping off dude 96 Bulls we actually need to run it back we actually are in the need of running it back round one was South Africa that's kind of free with the Hills this is a horrible guess by me dude oh my god dude I I I want to vomit even looking at that Blinky great guess Blinky great guess round three was Kenya everyone getting Kenya I don't know I honestly I didn't even wasn't even confident was Kenya so I just click Center but shout out to Mack for getting the right Reserve there I think maam did a lot of um Road fixing in Kenya mapping in Kenya so that would make sense but great guess Finland [ __ ] C and the round five was oh Northeast Brazil D my [ __ ] teammate imagine if bro just clicked a coast with water that would have been a great guess D not sure what you're doing there buddy no I'm just kidding why am I the one trying to act like I'm lining Reds up D getting three wolf getting two and Jami getting two and this 10 second we have wolf getting uh wait did Wolf get wolf is popping off wolf got second and first wolf is

last week's or last season's rainbow world 40 seconds so we're switching the map to 40 second Terminus and 10 second Terminus everyone lock in also also I recorded this yesterday because I've been back in Thailand now for like two days but I was so sick when I got back that it was like honestly like my voice voice sounded so nasly today it's better I hope but I was so nasly that like I was too embarrassed to post it um and I did well in the game and it was also just boring because I was sick I was like get this over with so today we're going to lock in Bring The Vibes up and guess Turkey right hopefully wait is this turkey this fencing is weird but it feels like Turkish pavement right and that looks like it could be a turkey baller right so I'm going to go like over here near like European turkey I think um yeah it's like this it was just European turkey I'm bad all right Malay head to the coast and call the day just kidding this should be Mainland malay we have the USA flag there which is kind of weird for Malaysia dude sometimes bait bait used to be believable right it used to be um all right let's think about this I think it's going to be like somewhere like honestly Central M maybe somewhat Coastal but oh [ __ ] me we're off to a great start here okay let's ra and guess po valley downtown San Marino [Music] it was just s Marino it was literally downtown I was like this looks really this looks a lot like s Marino oh man I'm off to listen sometimes it's it' be like that okay um yeah we're guessing off the blur here it's we have some crops there's two answers this could be Southern Brazil or like Central Java Indonesia I've seen roads like this over there and I'm going to hedge Southern Brazil like Salo s piranha region here maybe mgds something like this I'm going mgds nice it was just piranha and then we have a forest okay so I can bring back my points here I think Focus um I can't really read what that says but this trees kind of feel Australian and then I would go like Vic or Taz I think for a second I thought it was Australia but this fence also feels kind of tie which is kind of weird I don't really see where in tie no it's just Australia these too many eucalyptus trees uh D Vic in W what do we do here Taz yeah actually I'm not entirely sure it could be somewhere so could be even Queensland for all I know honestly have no idea it was Queensland for all I know all right I mean that's what you get sometimes uh in the game of G guess um but yeah let me cope on round two here uh yeah I mean I just yeah sure but yeah I hope you guys liked the World Cup um or the the European regionals I had a lot of fun it was a lot though eight hours a day for three hours on cast like really hurt my voice a lot and like I got majorly okay lock it slow down why is there English I guess that's just the Philippines probably like is it ever like like one of these like mes over here wow I kind of recognize that that's kind of nice okay let's not choke this Taiwan this road looks Taiwanese I'm like lowkey kind of good at this game sometimes like I kind of just like forget and then I think look at things like this I'm like where is this because is this Russia or is this like Canada and the only thing I can think of is like up here near Finland ah [ __ ] wait what is this oh it's Mongolia we're in Mongolia looks like this I actually have no idea where to get snow coverage in Mongolia just ool on I'm a freaking loser oh my God I'm so silly and quirky okay what is this Poland Southern Poland am I about to throw this because this is like Slovenia or something [Music] probably nope [Music] oh there's literally German on that sign that's kind of n yeah this isn't look anything like Poland that's just a throw I mean all in all it was a fine day solid Philly guess solid Taiwan I mean not really good Taiwan guess uh that was a fumble give me 11 seconds I get there and this was this oh this was Sweden okay did I go Finland I went Russia okay so I was trying to go Northern Finland cope this Queen's one kind of upsets me actually Queens one's maybe Queens one's getable here I think but I would go more North Queensland not Jim boomba what the heck is that kangaroo yo someone help bro wait that's actually so sad oh my God no oh my God I can't watch that I can't watch that why is all the cities known for is flooding [Music] okay I guess it does get a lot of rain there like a lot yeah okay that makes sense let's see what everyone else does damn you C fourth place all right it's next day and I did not do very well on the 42nd at least but that's okay like I play fine I just had a couple Mups um I'm gonna do this quick because I have to turn the AC off to record and it's literally 115 degrees outside European turkey everyone or a lot of people got um people Western turkey all over Europe round two probably the only one on Mainland couple people on Mainland but yeah that's just a bad guess round three was Sam Marino round four getting really close here so that's good uh probably the closest actually in round five they Ione go Brazil yeah Brazil round five was yeah came down to that Malay guas and they really messed me up but a lot of people getting Queens on there so and the 10 second I got seventh let's see out of 24 round one Philippines that was cool that I recognized that round two Taiwan everyone getting that round three what was this yeah this was a horrible guess oh my God what a bad guess but um yeah it's fine I had a couple like funny guesses today they just didn't really make any sense C or Mongolia and then like this like how do I go holding on that that's crazy trior getting three Finn getting two and Jami getting one and then 10 second bag gets six Jami popping off four

beatable score that's a bble score because the Philippines I lost a lot and I think you can get uh I think you can get LZ on here I really do and I think you can get latva here I'll take it though I'm I'm okay with that performance what I'm not okay with is Dyersburg the first thing that came up when I Googled Dyersburg Tennessee was bikini bottoms off-road park it's permanently closed now which is

oh it's next to Friendship like come on what more do you want go to family go of Affair and go of friendship also like w latitude guess all right I'm going to try and squeeze in RC's POV but I have a flight in like 5 hours and I don't want to miss it and I have to still edit this and upload this and get RC P before I go so oh wait okay real quick because I just mentioned editing is it bad that every single daily challenge video I've ever edited I've done one single timeline project like like literally every single daily challenge anyways let's see how everyone else does what's your thoughts on funnel cake on funnel cake I mean so it's fine but I feel like it's kind of greasy a lot of times so it's not my favorite like snack but on rating good rating um it's a solid like five wow yeah if you go to a fair what's like a 7 eight like a caramel apple no see that's the thing like yeah I mean yeah if they have like stuff like a caramel apple or something but at Ferris they don't have like amazing options most of the time I probably just go for the popcorn that's that's that's actually you know what sucks about Germany what they they only believe in like caramelized popcorn you you don't get like Salted Popcorn what is that what I mean I like caramelized popcorn but like at the movies though that's like that's like actually fed Behavior okay lock in lock in lock lock in lock in

Mount Gambier ever lowkey um or like South South what I meant when I gamb um yeah I actually think I like this region a lot so I'm just going to commit it solid round two oh okay this is doable I lowkey think it's just a city in southern Borneo like something down here um could be man no I really do so we have like the Chinese there which I think you get a lot of the Chinese here maybe maybe that's wrong or maybe I'm just making up things that's like literally everywhere but I'm going to I'm act like it I'm sure you get other places in um borne with Chinese there but I've seen a lot of Chinese in that City okay we're was playing Malay today aren we oh fool me one sh on you fool me wait I don't even know I'm going with that can I do it again though or my am my one trick pony in Malay this is not Borneo there's no way this is Borneo this is just Mainland right there's no way this is Borneo I've never seen a Borneo Road look like this oh man yeah I'm I'm going to go like something like this just kale okay I should just clicked K we'll take that oh okay Ukraine I'm gonna go Ukraine here and hope I'm right it's pretty good round for it's probably this road right here right the e95 surely could be something like this actually is it more West I'm going to go here I think be like something like this maybe this road here or this one but should be one of these three when you try your best but you don't succeed you get what you want not what you need um this looks distinct I mean it's turkey freaking Russia dude how's it not Ukraine how do you CH up being scar bro I will not be the only person in Ukraine c um yeah I don't know it looks like something over here in Turkey if it's like I don't even care anymore hello I don't know man I the road quality just looked so Ukrainian to me that's bad I mean does it really look like it let's let's look at this in a new Landes close my eyes and open again like I see for the first time yeah I go Ukraine again I can't let me do it again okay go your again one more time I might go rush it the third time 10 second ter this let's actually lock in now SK looks like a weird SK sure oh Lord no I thought immediately Indo like dude [ __ ] rainy coverage makes no sense was Endo I'm fine with that guess though honestly this is like Alberta or like Northern Manitoba dude zoom in like something up here like how's a [Music] BC then it's like they even got rid of the street you here like what are we doing am I tripping did we see mountains oh Lord Mountain Water West I'm just going to go Central Islands here [ __ ] LZ on this is not a good day sure I go France get this right though and not do I go Denmark I go Denmark and I get it wrong because it's just France and that's okay I'm going to go okay um not an easy seed by any means okay coping is about to come in round two I'm okay with not getting Indo here this is not an easy Endo well that's an easy Endo this is not an easy Endo what look at this like people go Colo on this for sure one injured one arrested suspicious fire and Prince rer BC that's not good that low key looks like the same neighborhood we were just in how do you get there where is the airport you have to take a fery you have to take a fery from the airport then the f is only 20 minutes from some on day also there's some on they they got school buses on there doesn't look like any houses here this literally just an airport interesting oh there's some civilization here I guess for the dock the more you know but let's see how everyone else does so it has to be like a weird place in Victoria New South Wales holes don't recognize yeah I just don't really think of wait it could be Western V oh it's 2023 H like here I might be throwing we'll see okay that's a pretty good guess I think um seu came to mind here zeu Oru I think it looks more like seu maybe let's see okay I mean it looks probably most like uh k to me panang or something or a singor or a perak something on the coast there think it feels more Eastern I'm going trust that oh it was singor yeah not ever Iceland okay could be Russia we have something like fire weed here could be Russian to me I want to say not think I prefer just like go here okay Chell Korea yeah I don't know De John bro what is this like uh okay I thought about Sula but I went I mean yeah CL that's unlucky is this uh like or no it's like here wait it's like Juno yeah oh okay it's actually BC but I mean I don't know where like here just click on the 5K what the hell uh I don't know I'm gonna go like Germany was Denmark okay I thought about first place how am I in first because you had a good BC guas there no one got right true I guess yeah oh I mean yeah ter crazy like how's that if I saw the black car it was free Co why is it free with the black car because like black car is really common in that part of sua okay or used to be but now it's all been over in and it looks completely different yeah GG's G all right it's next

lock in you go ni or Scotland here it's ni I oh it's Ireland okay okay I can't be mad that uh Sri Lanka wait is this like just a very nice Sri Lankan wait Panama wait [ __ ] dude this is the wrong continent okay token teens sa Paulo actually I think Minos okay oh Lord um Colombia Columbia Brazil Columbia Ecuador Brazil Mexico Columbia first guess colia okay um yeah I played well both days I just missed uh my ni guess or my Ireland guess that was a great Cambodia call um I saw this white house and I saw like Joe B no and then I was like white houses are usually common in um Ireland but I should have went ni but it is what it is it's a very fun seed I I think very very fun seed so okay but where is this maning it's actually a maning okay thanks or life is simple oh my God not the not the iMovie soundtrack where life is simple unexpected shopping true did not expect this to be here great coffee a live laugh love sign you love to see it some pizza looks mid all right let's see everyone else does is that just a kto pole think maybe I can't see it well but maybe okay yep yeah 5K right here a of Coursey moment bro like what yeah something's not adding up here cuz it looks like Baja but we have white car I don't know it looks so much like there okay apparently you can I did not know that I mean it should be just Iowa I think okay first place I could still throw on this two more yeah I'll go two more I think it's Su I mean everyone else two more yeah second's fine oh it's Cambo that's why Co okay okay ah dude I knew it was going to be wrong but I didn't know where to go oh gosh what is this oh I moved away from like the 5K okay I mean it wasn't bad game it's just yeah all right it's the next day let's see how we did I got 10th Place out of 25 people playing round one was Japan I presume was the Cai round right let's see yeah lots of people getting kind of the region there uh Blinky great guess Gorka great guess Tokyo guessers great guess round two was bhan uh and

City zigzag close Snell dude snil is popping off that's my 96 Bulls teammate baby let's go lots of people getting this region of Mexico that round four is Iowa the Iowa guesser is RC tricker M uh Toro and wolf lots of Nebraska here this is the downfall my points was hedging western Nebraska for some reason when it's literally not looks doesn't look like that at all and the round five was uh only wolf myself Jami and Eddie I think Harrier getting that lots of Team War here makes sense same everyone getting East or newes though so that's that's uh that's fair because of the pole and then snail getting first place again where am I six and people played 27 people finishing this one let's see what happened here round one was Cambo consis great guess everyone getting Cambo though so no one went Scotland I guess two people me and wolf went Scotland okay wolf going Scotland is kind of validating let's just clear and I clear Ireland I guess no one went that North but Gorka getting up there couple in I guessers let see was round three uh Sri Lanka yeah I mean this one you had to think about it's kind of weird because it kind of looked super like different than like typical like neighborhoods in Sri Lanka but everyone got that so that's good and then Brazil no one got Minos at all literally everyone no one literally got me and then EA yeah dude snail getting first place back to back is crazy and Diono getting third where we run back to 96 Bulls maybe all right I fixed a score from yesterday so don't no no need to comment snail getting nine Linley getting nine and RC getting 18 oh [ __ ] look at this this is close that's RC needs to get second place tomorrow and con needs to get at least third um nice okay and then 10 second snail put himself on the board here

right it's another day to play the game you guys but more importantly it's another day we get to lock in and use our Lin round one a rainbow world 40 seconds back to another normal day it's been a while I also updated a rainbow world or SLP did so there is new Kazakhstan and Salto coverage added you guys are playing this but round one is neither of those and this is Northern Finland okay about as standard Northern Finland as you can get and I'm going to go up here somewhere like this road right here is that considered Northern Finland I would say anything like north of here is Northern Finland Central Southern that's North if it's north of like the lake or the Gulf oh we're doing this again we're doing this again are we listen do I go Uganda national park again or do I go Kenya this tree feels more like Southern Kenya you know like something you'd see near KY and really in all of Africa but I'm going to go in National Park in southern Kenya down here preferably one that has roads marked like this one could this be Uganda yes do I think I'm five Kyon Kenya I do and it was actually that Reserve call me the goat call what you want you can call luck too if you want that's also fair but you know it's more deduction skills than anything I would say okay this is zah and we have Hills West um yeah personally me I go petoran and probably get good points but then you're like wait these Hills make you want to go more North like here and I think it could be this or I think it could be even more like South like down here near Newcastle and the obvious answer is ptor but okay it was more North okay I'm actually I'm happy with my guess there that's a good guess that's a good guess because the hills deduction skills we made it okay now surely this is just ba surely you go ba here right what else would this be is it ever like North I think it's just ba I could see it being North like up here but the strawberry on the side doesn't really make sense I kind of just want to go like Western ba maybe like maybe even Cordova now that I'm even using my Noggin even a little more it's pretty dry and now I want to go really North like North like up here near salta [ __ ] dude okay I'm just going to go near Cordova okay Mendoza but like I called it like ba but like West and so like that was kind of the right Vibe but I kind of just threw that life goes on and then Switzerland okay standard day for for uh rainbolt world but let's uh make a good guess here shall we um yeah it's north maybe near like lucern or something yeah I think this is a I mean you don't really see the Alps anywhere I think over here by zerich is probably fine and it was nice was it like a 22k 21k 227 yeah it's fine um this is 24 cable seed though for sure um which I think it's fun I think it's fun to have these I pretty much region guess everything perfectly um or within like the right like I called my vibes out I think fine like I called Northern Finland and I called like dry West ba I he kind of went in the wrong area called Northern zah called the right national forest and Kenya and then like Northern Switzerland's obvious but could be like maybe a top 10 top five um but we'll see let's move on to terminus and do where the big boys are playing 10 second let's run it on Terminus you guys know the Vibes we got lock in yeah this is low like this is Yucatan if you know you know uh Malta do you go Malta here wait is this a lowy crack score this is A50 area code isn't that Orlando that's 251 wait am I tripping wait uh so fine and then what is this France formania Bulgaria FR Eastern Europe somewhere like Italy ever ah let's get guess down it's gonna be like Italy I don't go to the UK there I just don't wait where were we facing there's a yellow sticker on the polls here which I would get UK on that if we were see if we saw that but I don't think we saw that no I I I don't go UK here I just don't I mean 19k 189 yukatan I think is free malta's free Java's free this is obvious like Southern us um 850 what's Orlando Orlando is 321 right and then 407 so I'm not sure why I went Orlando I guess this is a Pensacola uh yeah I mean I can't believe he got Pensacola wrong this is also probably good time to mention like about like probably two or three months ago there was a point where a memorized every us area code for a video with Nelson it was very hard and I spent a lot of time on and the only time I get a code in NPC it doesn't even pay off because I [ __ ] forgot if you guys are interested in like memory techniques or like how the how we memorize like 350 three-digit numbers in a week quick shout out to Nelson there I've literally been to Pensacola so many times in my life like I can't even do a deep dive on pinacol City Lord because I gu know too much about it the Blue Angels I think is what they're called Blue Angels those are that's a cool part about Pensacola that's technically Alabama low key this is 251 I just forgot it honestly comes down to whoever gets the UK right here like where where even is this what even is this grouth grouth it's like an industrial like the town that was obliterated you can also see the extent of the town with details like the original site of the police station the post office Crown in and zland arms in by 1896 the harbor has been become disused and is now called the old Harbor even at this early stage trade on the canal was decreasing gr had a railway station from around 1860 some additional tracks led to the docks at that time but clearly you can see many more real lines in and around the new dock this Google Earth view shows the same area of the old town today and as you can see there is nothing left of that Old Town wow a building or Street just that old abandoned dock that's actually devastating that was a somber way to end the video but uh looks like it was just like a Poppin industrial city that they built railroads to and then people stopped using the canals I think is what I got from that and then they like expanded East and then like Left Behind the original City I hope I got that right if someone can correct me if I misunderstood the that video but that's um interesting yeah it did look very industrial which is why I did not get it right because it's hard to guess it's hard to guess indust industrial places but let's see how everyone else did think it's spinland here okay guys oh no see yesterday we had the ugan trer I think this is now the Kenyon trer um ah dude which one is it I think it's the I'm S one but I'm not sure it might be like here or here oh no it's this one what really I don't know like I'm not sure exactly where I want to go here I'll go for that no I knew it was going to be something more okay this one I should be able to cook if I think yeah I mean I thought maybe this road think if it can be anything else I think I'm going to go for that okay good it is that narrator he did cook he did cook wait that's crazy the no throwing this time this is Ja pain bro yeah I mean here we should be fine okay nice 23 and you had like a low key like I mean you could pick the points in Kenya and yeah yeah yeah knowing argentini and Roads moment all right kind of cringe but like also like respect well you know yeah actually take that back or I think that's admirable thank you yeah thank you I'm just kidding it's [ __ ] CR bro anyways okay lock lock oh why are we playing skew today uh what I think like Yucatan it's like rock walls or something okay good Malta is ever goo no I don't know it is goo okay um was I don't know I have to just go like here because I can't tell H dude if it's like downtown I think it's like suraya pavement or not Sur East Java Central Java but it wasn't even Central Java it was East Java skull not survive sorry I'm getting my yeah why is there a nuclear power PL going on here what the [ __ ] it's like Al ever oh no wait what the UK bro I so sure that was Russia that's crazy definitely not yeah definitely not going UK there I was lowkey thinking Carolina the first and then I realized there's like a ton of Palms here I was like oh wait City yeah if you could live anywhere in the Gulf where you live and the golf I mean yeah definitely here like I would be living here no I'm I'm good oh man we someone definitely just caught stray watching this video that's crazy yeah all right GG's all right so next day let's see how we did I got up third out of 25 people playing so I'll things sered not too bad currently recording this during the halftime of the Alabama Yukon game game so I'm going do this quickly I get everyone that played the daily challenges to make a bracket before he March Madness ocean man is currently in first place with Purdue and RC is in second place with Yukon so if Yukon wins RC's looky goated I'm at like yeah don't even look at mine okay round one was the Finland that was just standard how many people got the right park here a lot okay well Blinky Oscar maam Jam myself tricker lots of people around the reserve we'll take it round three went can there was just Northern um zah lost vioria all over there yeah and me they nipped anotic there couple outside but we'll take that round Fort was an RC moment only person getting the right Road there he's just that guy and then round five was yeah Switzerland 10 seconds I am very interesting to see how many people got round if anyone got the UK right I'll be insanely surprised 28 people finishing and no one got the UK round one Yucatan lots of people getting yukatan there round two where El did they go yeah kind of over the place there round two was Malta lots of people getting Malta lots of people getting going north okay uh round three oh yeah any Pensacola Anna and uh conas and mobile same area code there so that

that's not bad not bad at all actually um conest amen bag oh my God there's such a funny comment on yesterday's video someone was like it's so obvious bag is cheating like can you guys make it can you make it less obvious like guys he's literally one of the best players in the world Slovakia Austria czechia Russia Kazakhstan turkey France Belgium Finland yeah that's just not getable that's just not

eastern city in Russia that's like Max East on the water wait no I've seen like coverage like this and one of these cities over here there's like a a slope on one what city was it down here am I tripping was it one of these cities ahead I've seen this elevation going into to a city skyline maybe it was down here Omsk this map is supposed to be bait I got 6,000 that's okay is Argentina here getable no also like how is this ever on like how is this ever Omsk there's no way this guy jjk found a hilly gen 3sk you guys want to see what msk looks like you're telling me this flat ass area is the same within 20 miles of that that is how we know if a player is cheating if they get that right they're banned you don't go Omsk there you don't you just don't if anyone when i'ms they're not your friend anymore they're your enemy and you ban them from Ever playing with v guys with you ever again how is that obsk hopefully 10 seconds if I get more than 5,000 on this I'll be happy just give me 5,000 just 5,000 that's all I want locking this is supposed to be very hard see this looks like Mount game beard therefore I'm going deran Cape Town I got the country right he wanted me to go Australia there I'm not going austr he wants me to go us here I'm going France he wants me to go us here I'm going France I'm not going Iowa I'm not going Illinois I'm going France it's not bad I'm playing psychology games this Hawaii no yellow Center Line pull s pull Sol pull Sol pull Sol pull H second Korea is only thing is H this Bangladesh surely but it would never be that easy right how's it Malaysia maybe I go indo maybe a Java not in Malaysia just not 12,000 I'm proud of that 12,000 I'm proud of that 12,000 let's see how everyone else does yeah I'm seeing I'm seeing I seeing the vision um I thought like arge like Arch I was thinking like like here somewhere like tandil has some Bay locations like this or something let's see yeah I don't have anything else okay it was Arch Mendoza yeah that that makes sense I I think I is I think in like Italy or something I don't know like here yeah I don't know oh wait what Jordan that's crazy good luck why do I think like South Korea I think yeah I don't know it's like yeah the trees remind me of South Korea I'm going South Korea here curi away oh know it's what I don't know I thought it's like Nebraska or something but no I can't I don't know I know there's like something weird going on but I don't know what it is oh wow wow Idaho I don't want to like get baited and go east for no reason like I mean it could be like Nova subus do I go for that I'm going to go for I guess oh no okay I mean I mean yeah gen 3s that is quite crazy I mean you played well honestly like yeah yeah like you played really well in my opinion I mean I don't know I have to go a still I don't know what it is South Africa yeah of course it's South Africa just not here it's it that's crazy oh it's Malaysia good thing there's the pole over here can barely make it out is it like Hong Kong or something no no Mak the white play Taiwan okay it was Taiwan let's go uh this looks like Bangladesh what am I tripping oh oh it's Malaysia okay all right it's the next day and um I'm excited to click this select all button to see how we all did but on the first one I got 14th with and Blinky getting first place with 13,000 points all right let's see how we did select all that's what I was expecting let me see if there's more than 25 people there is we have to reselect all and take out JJ wow okay I'm not not going to look at everyone's guesses I'm just going to look at who got him right and I'm not going to count these scores on the leader board because it's just unfair because this is like maybe more luck than a lot okay who got Argentina we'll give props for props to do bag deor Oscar tricker and RC and then Chile with um who got Jordan right no one got Jordan okay literally no one no one got Mexico literally no one how many SK people do we have lots of SK okay round four anyone get Idaho no one get Idaho that's actually a good sign if you get Idaho there you're probably cheating round five and we get Omsk no one got obsk okay all right this is fun this is fun okay 10 seconds will I ever do again maybe probably not but uh 30 people finishing okay let's see what this one looks like probably lots of lines here going east west lots of lines here yeah round bag winning with 16,000 points on this is actually insane I'm getting six and the lowest yeah we have some five digits which is me last okay Cape last people get Cape last people going Australia makes sense round two that's what yeah I mean that's the obvious us you know but like you can't really go us okay Jacob and Jami in France oh Donis is back for this by the way Donis got 10th Place can everyone say w Donis W Donis D is an AI okay Borneo if you guys saw the Sava Pole then that would make sense did anyone go Hawaii there yeah okay I thought the Hawaii was

northern Malay that's just skill right there yeah the obvious answer was Bangladesh so shout to everyone in Bangladesh but sweet thank you guys for um supporting these daily challenge series for a 100

right it's another day to play the game ofer but more importantly it's another day we could wake up and use our freaking Noggin round one this looks like Belgium housing um like brick Oh there's there's literally Belgium ballards right there okay round two um okay so it looks like we have an Irish fence here it's a real thing I stand by the Irish fence the Irish fence is like on the corner of the fences in Ireland and Northern Ireland you get these like curved edges right so I'm going to go Ireland here I'm just going go Central Ireland and probably hope or maybe somewh more North and hope for a good guess it was southern Ireland but it was an Irish fence that's all that matters round two it's not easy okay so my media thought was like a weird Nigeria like Abuja or something outside of Abuja oh Lord I'm taking a sip of my tai te I needed to lock in for this one sorry guys what's could this be like not ever Uganda national park right I don't think it would be that I might just go north of Abuja but like what else could this be it's never anything besides Africa so it's like Krueger or something maybe you guys remember that one time when I was like making a guess and I said it's never Uganda national park right Northwest Tasmania I don't like this game anymore like I sometimes I'm like wow this is the best game ever and I'm really privileged to be able to do this for a living and sometimes I'm like it's okay if I never have to play this game again you know no I'm just kidding I like to use my Noggin you guys like how I'm currently acting like stalling because I also don't know what the heck this is um Italy Spain France if it's France I would go Corsica Italy Spain I'm going Italy if it's Spain I'm going Spain if it's Italy I'm going Italy if it's Spain I'm going Spain if it's Italy I'm going Italy it's France I've had better days I've had better days how's this not Tasmania let's look at it for a second the these are Tasmanian shrubs like they just are called the Nana National Park I I listen it was one of the two it was one of the two France was getable there fine Belgium guess horrible Ireland region guess one of my lesser days but it's okay because in order to have a high you have to have a low let that just be your lesson for day if you want to have a good day you have to have a bad day the rain will go away I have to guess do this isn't Pei right where was where even was do what the [ __ ] is this port Limington wait did I forgot where do was I'm actually a fraud wasn't it over here oh I guess I'm do oh I'm actually good shout out to do um port lemington this Russia or Ukraine or Baltic I want to go Ukraine here so badly I want to go eastern Ukraine what if it's like not even like either I'll take that this is the UK or no this is like Netherlands or wait what the [ __ ] is this that is the craziest Netherlands ever wait I guess it's maybe some like German influence but like what is this what is this housing for that looks like a Dutch house this paneling is that not weird for Netherlands we got there in the end though so that's okay this is Bulgaria like this you're telling me that is Lithuania what a boring seed I mean that's just boring I'm doing another Terminus lock I'm sorry it's just free country bulgary pole free Netherlands free Lithuanian free like I'm not like Terminus you want to use your Noggin okay I'm using my Noggin on Terminus Sam 10 seconds again let's run it the only thing that was difficult there was okay we have oil Palms you want to go Malay or you have to go indo because of the Sal dish it's pointing up so we're going to be near the equator okay double signpost makes you think Wisconsin and Minnesota I think maybe it was Michigan has double sign post I'm going Wisconsin it was no that was a miles per hour sign in in the distance this his maximum D honestly canas oh no oh no I have no idea I was going to go Hong I I can't even cope I I couldn't tell if it was Hong Kong or Taiwan bro I thought I saw Chinese here like zooming in last second like Taiwan doesn't really make sense logistically but uh if I had 15 seconds I'd get H Kong there call it a cope call it what you want I call it facts is this Netherlands again or Denmark or I have to go Netherlands here yeah this is literally just Uganda not or wait what is this this is a no this is Uganda yeah that hill was crazy big okay yeah I mean how the [ __ ] is where is this Notre Dame Notre Dame dunord what the [ __ ] is going on Notre d d [Music] [Applause] Nord holy [ __ ] dude that thing was going hella fast how is that going that fast you guys see that like that reminds me of like the do brick like Tesla clip in [Music] [Applause] LA I feel much better about my Us guest now how do I when's the next TW it's cancelled bro no the authorities have received a report concerning security problems linked to Spectators yeah bro they were like did you not see the videos it started in 1981 they've been doing this for 40 years and I've never heard about this for to $400,000 in prizes dude truck radio drivers are eating more than jig supress dude why are they have like thirst trap photos for these trucks look at this they put the [ __ ] vignette around it that's not how I expected to spend my uh Thursday afternoon but let's see how everyone else does this will be quick but thank you again to PPN for sponsoring the daily challenge series we made it if you guys don't know what VPN is it's a virtual private Network which basically means with a single click of a button you can make make it look like your device is anywhere else in the world it encrypts your data protects your IP and you can get past GE restrictions sounds like a nice little deal right I've been using pvpn for like over a year now I personally like it because only with one account you can access it on unlimited devices so it's on like my PC my laptop and my phone so that's clutch the thing I actually use it most for is to get past your restrictions so since I'm in Thailand some of the sites I try and get to are like blocked so especially in the daily challenge series sometimes I'm like doing research on like random cities the website will be like blocked but I'll turn a VPN on make it look like I'm in the US and then start researching the random cities then but if you want 83% off with four months free you can go ahead and click the link in my description or the pin comment thank you again to pvpn for sponsoring Challenge Series let's see how everyone else does feel like I'm behind I'm going to go here I know it was you called the 5K twice this is North Sumatra I think with that pole top let's go here nice good start Good Start feels okay double sign post maximum yeah I thought of here that's bur dude okay that's a guess that's a guess that's a good guess let's go okay a what's that Hong Kong maybe let's go dude oh my gosh I'm on a good score right now score yeah we have a y play okay first thought it was like lith but no I think this is Netherland somewhere okay nice can still get 24K here let's see that would be Uganda surely yeah Paul looks right oh my gosh bro what's like the record on yuganda or on 24 five that's a crazy like wait go to the npz record yeah let's see wait that'll be to that's the best score ever well I think it's safe to see he'll probably get first on that one I hope so bro that would be get devastating if I didn't wow if you just play 2,000 games in a day then maybe you'll improve you know yeah yeah that's crazy sheesh GG's oh oh no this guy RC hasn't changed his [ __ ] fire alarm bro what wait you can hear that bro dude change your you're get oh my God lock in bro lock in one sec my mom was seting all right all right bro you're GNA have to like cut that out or some

got this is not that good that's the closest I've ever been to last and that's okay you have to have high days to have low days and if I'm being honest this wasn't even that bad of a day this is free of bja if you go Uganda you're good Blinky new the national park okay wait I'm skipping ahead okay boring okay boring okay this is 50-50 this one okay mackam Deb bre and Jers good company quite frankly we're right they're wrong great guesses to everyone in Uganda in my opinion if you went Kenya you should also have the same points as going Nigeria you know so like realistically I'm like maybe you know there's what four people in Kenya um so that get that puts me to 20th okay round four um Tasmania is a better guest than Victoria here so therefore there's one two three four there's like 11 people there therefore I'm like ninth now okay redeemed this actually a good day for me if you think about it and um yeah blundered on Italy but we had a what was it why why did I go it here what was this lock yeah this is never reallyy that's okay though it's okay that bad guesses okay we're all Human After All shout out to the person that sings that forgot who it was all right and then the 10se second was the one that Oscar did well on this a good seed this a good seed nor suuma Vibes are there round two everyone getting Endo there so that's always good round two is uh okay base aan we're the only us guessers that's okay but a lot of people getting this region in Canada so shout out to them round three was Hong Kong anyone who went Taiwan with me let's cope conas went Taiwan with me D and I think that's Eddie so I mean what you want for me and kada yeah this was this is not an easy one and Notre Dame bro I gotta pull up to Notre Dame if they they don't get uncancelled soon

don't know that's and we'll be there I'll probably do more IRL stuff like I'll definitely be doing daily challenges with everyone every day in person so that's going to be Banger content if you think about it getting de on the camera might be the biggest like PR risk I could possibly do but it's okay okay cons getting 19 he's one point away from uh winning here blink is at 16 and aan is at nine it looks like history is repeating itself here with consis again and then Oscar is at 13 Jami is at two and Gorka is at two and I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

I just want one day eventually you know some days it's okay and some days you use your Noggin a little bit less and that's okay too because you know not every day is a day you want to use your nogin

C Tri Point bro this is cookable because we have like the slope is like eastwards which is interesting like maybe like I don't know okay was near here I think I think we're looking at this guy guy right here Mount Aras and we're like here close enough okay it's like these mountains or something I mean surely you got to go there nope of course it's north okay this felt like minda now I feel like kind of reminds me of like down here somewhere sorry I have to think about these roads I think I'm going to hedge like this cuz it could be as far as like here but it could be like here nor place we take that let's go is that norat triple let cook oh you actually just put on the grill uh I thought Croatia maybe not but what this guy have for breakfast what did I have for breakfast uh I'm not sure

company North Sumatra North Sumatra was free because of the pole I'll teach you guys the pole real quick actually when the pole is symmetric in the Middle with alternating 21 on the side it's uh North somatra so you could see when we were paying this way I saw the pole was in middle and I saw one and two insulators that's nor samantra you also have like oil Pals here which is super helpful then

right it's another to play the game of J but more importantly it's another day we could wake up and use our freaking Noggin wake up it's the second of the month round one okay and this is where we like to see nogin use a round one because it's just random rural European field that we're going to try and decipher what we can get from this um it's not Italy it's not France it could be France actually it might be France is either like France or czechia right and for me personally I don't think it I don't see it really being anything FR or check here maybe like a no it's not Poland could be like a southern Poland so check it would make sense let just check yet that's a good guess round one round two what a beautiful location blue skies Green Fields Brazilian dirt and I'm going pretty South here I might even go rgds I might just do it bye golly what's life without a couple risks you know I'm going to go rgds it looks flat these trees kind of line up just makes sense it was piranha but rgds isn't really that bad of a call out in my opinion okay we have a boring Ghana it's East West Road in Ghana and let me if thought is this road it's not that North I don't think it's north at all actually I think it's more Coastal than North how green it is um yeah it's like directly east west like straight so I'll go like on this road like something like that this isn't the right road but it could be over here too maybe even even by kamasi it was by kamasi okay and listen this is just a free Ireland you have to go Ireland here right yeah yeah like you have to I mean it could be Scotland but like it's the green Irish grass in the middle of the like like I said when you get this green grass in the middle it's it's IR Ireland not the UK and it was over there by gway I'm about to cook and please let allow me to cook it's the 41 the key to life is to say things with confidence and then in hopes that's it's right it looks way cooler than it actually was that's the key to life I mean that was a that was a good game that was a fine game it actually a very decent game I would say but like a very free game and I lowkey through round five like I don't really I don't win here because someone gets closer in Ghana czechia or not maybe not czechia I probably get really one of the closest in czechia but uh yeah it's pretty pretty standard um I'll do one more because that was kind of a boring I'll do I'll go quick though I'll go quick I'll go quick so it's not boring the sun is also set oh is this Panama it was Panama I don't know anything about Pama but okay you go somewhat Northern Sweden or like Central Sweden here I feel like okay it Stockholm um um uh what is this roof it looks like it could be like this roof right but like it looks like it's over here no is it ever even France or like UK wait no it's never the UK it looks too pretty to be the UK wait what is this this roof is so thr off I'm going go Italy I think but like why is it like Spain Port no it's never Portugal it was France dude [ __ ] France I'm sorry I don't mean that um Indonesia no it's Philly I don't know man I go lose on okay I'm I'm a loser for going lose on this is this road right wait this is a different Snow Mountain Road what mountain is this is this the one South like down here somewhere I know there's Road I know there's snow on this road so I'm going commit it but it was red okay that was more fun we had a Panama and a fun France guest I got wrong and a cool Road in kran so we'll we'll use that one okay 10 second Terminus let's do this I've had a good track history the past couple days I want to keep that up Terminus 10 seconds I'm Southern Brazil Mexico Mexico Philippines or sui why are we driving it should be sui right okay Columbia Ecuador Columbia Ecuador col Columbia not Mexico Columbia I'm locked the [ __ ] in that's an Arkansas okay okay this would be like somewhere over here Northeast Arkansas like one for like or down the behind Bluff okay do not choke ground five I'm quite literally it's Thailand there's no way gives me Thailand uh we've all been there right we've all been there did I just get my Visa revoked probably we've all been there you I thought through my head when I said this is Thailand there's no way they G me the Thailand right there was a split second where I was like oh this is probably this looks kind of like Philippines you can't blame me no you quite literally can't blame me truly I'm not the only person that goes tiing on this right oh lord for someone that spent so much time practicing and like taking pride in the country recently on Geer and you in her life it just hurts me like why can't I lose why can't I go like Columbia on Ecuador like why can't that be the guess I miss I mean yeah I'll walk you guys through my I mean like look at this like look at this absolute like goated perform I mean like look at that also just for like for the sake of like telling people um education there are sesy fences in this which is the reason why I got that right when you have these like close white together like fences with like painted bottoms these are SOC usually they're like blue or red oh we also have the stick on the back of the car I didn't see that though but yeah these are uh these are sua fences but it was weird though because it looked like this car was driving um it looked like it was driving right for a second um but this actually the back of the car and then I can see this was the front of the car driving left and so I was like okay this see another day full of some ups and downs but uh let's see what everyone else does sick Bro what song are you playing here um laugh is a okay bro I've seen your playlist BR you have you can have a better song than that I don't know I was

right it's another day to play the game J but more importantly it's another day to use your freaking Noggin everyone's locked in why because I am why am I so locked in today because today's a different day today if everyone looks at the bottom of the computer sees a date presumably it's April Fool's Day April 1st I thought what better way to celebrate April Fool's Day than to troll or we'll see some pros so I have two maps that are labeled a rainbow world and Terminus that I tasked jhk a good friend of mine in PH GS Pro to make two troll maps for the daily challenge today that's all I told them I don't know what to expect at all on these they could be unofficial coverage they could be insanely hard locations but the goal is to trick the players into thinking it's like a normal day and it being like something completely random or difficult I don't know what to expect because I didn't want it to go in this like with any advantage so I already kind of do have an advantage because I'm can tell it's a troll map I don't know what kind of troll it is if if I had a heart rate monitor right now it would be like 125 because I honestly don't know what to expect but I'm going have to lock in or something let's see a rainb world April 1 April Fool's Day I'm so freaking nervous dude round one there's no way this is where this is going there's no way this is where this is going wait I'm actually sweating oh my God maybe because it's 110 degrees outside but also because this is a uh this looks like it's going to be going into deep cut jaser lore or like Niche jaser references in the community that I will probably have to not only get the country right or the guest right but also explain why it's relevant and this is an all-timer like an absolute Aller it's an newon or maybe it's in what was it like Tampa oh my God what was the city okay context there's like a in an old Geo wizard video like years ago Geo wizard went like Tampa or like some like Southern was it like one of those like casino gambling cities or something it was like one of what city was it I'll have to find the clip I'll put the clip here is it could it be true is it Anan that's the worst guess ever then I have just mistaken Anan bat for Atlantic City now I'm even more nervous though because like what if I don't get the reference oh my God my heart is like actually beating so fast wait is this what I think JK is going for dude wait J is actually insanely smart for this wait oh my I have to explain so much lore that he's forcing me to explain now actually okay so this is turkey or it could be Arkansas right one would easily go Arkansas in this right or like Oklahoma what was it was it oklah no I don't want to no no no no stop stop give me into Turkey um yeah I don't know Western turkey sure okay it was turkey and I think what jhk is going for here or like the reference this is making is okay I have to give like more background now okay so basically when I run tournaments it's like important for the Integrity of the tournaments that everyone's not cheating right and so something common that I would run in tournaments is this thing called skill tests and so if a player exceeded expectations or had really good games um we would put them through a skill test and basically what a skill test is is to prove you're legit I go and Discord and I screen share a oh this sounds so bad I go on Discord and screens share locations and we play games because when they don't have the locations on their screen they can't pull the API and it can't tell you where it is so it's like a way to stop them from cheating or like to play legit is you screen share and they have to say MVC what country it is and where they think it is and explain the process it's one of the best ways to like get someone to tell their guess I don't remember who it was bro but like one of like the best pros at the time I think this s this looks exactly like that lock but one of the like a very successful GS per I think at the time when USA when said it was Turkey when was like the most obvious USA ever and it was like one of the worst skill test performances of all time that like when you look at someone's performance in a tournament versus like a skill test it was like two games played versus like 20,000 games played and I think that's what jhk is referencing there I I really think it is because I don't know what else would I have a bridge and turkey that I should be missing I hope that's what the reference is what is this I mean it's like Brazil wait what reference am I not getting here is this too is this too big of a deep cut for me oh no I have to ask J okay wait okay it looks like aury right or like somewhere over here West I don't know what am I missing here oh I actually don't know what this is oh my God I cannot wait to see everyone's reactions to like the locations for this and get like R do imagine if like RC or zigzag don't pick up on it oh my go I'll have I'll make sure to get the reactions to this I don't know what it's just I don't know the reference should I know that reference am I like out of the community enough to not get that reference is that too big of a deep cut it might be too big of a deep cut for me Aur it was accurate I don't know I don't know I was too busy thinking of the reference bro is this what I think it is it has to be okay this is so much fun because it's like testing my I mean this all this is all stuff like happened like years ago oh my God it's denet the infamous denet okay which one is it okay more [Music] context okay dude how do I even explain this okay so everyone knows it's like easy to cheat on Geer right and the way that people usually cheat and I'm not advocating for this but the most obvious way for that people cheat is they download something online that tells you where to guess and some of the programs that tells you where to guess it basically just gives you like a city or like the province it tells you where to guess right it tells you like it says like Moscow right or like St Louis Missouri right the amount of people that have been caught cheating the most obvious way people are caught cheating is when they go denet on this Ukraine location when it's in this denet in Russia it's the most obvious way to tell if someone's cheating because it tells that it's in denet and they're two like not good enough to know that there's more than one denet and so they end up going in the wrong denet and it's like an obvious tell if you're cheating but it's like one of those obvious again like cheating lore of the G communities when some players got caught cheating by going the wrong to netk it's uh that's pretty funny oh my god dude I'm sweating wait what round was that dude JK's a menace this is okay so rainbow world is like all cheating scandals it seems like one of the best players on comp went Barbados which doesn't even have street view coverage how can you claim you're the one of the best players and then go Barbados like oh my God okay I need to figure out what the acre reference was all right Terminus I'm kind of nervous guys I'm not going to lie cuz it's like I have to use my brain to think of like the references and then I have to think about where that reference was and like what it was used for and like where the actual location is cuz I feel like I've seen most of these I hope so I don't know what the accurate one was but all right Terminus lock in 10 seconds might be even that's what the location was wait was it it was Atlantic city was it wait was was it the video that GE wizard was it that he went Atlantic City on Mongolia or is it that he went Ulan on on Atlantic City I forgot I feel like it was or is that two separate Clips I actually don't know did he go oh my God I have to find the video I think that's another GE wizard moment though that definitely is unlucky bezo unlucky this is the sanctuary I think one of these rights dude okay this isn't all this is another cheater but snow relax the goat if you know you know what zigzag video I think that was in a zigzag video or like with Snorlax or like maybe Peter where snow relax one of the most famous you cheaters of all time went uh I think he went GH on that or something but yeah that's a weird house Akra maybe whereabouts sorry Akra South uh yeah I'm happy you yeah there's a person it's interesting the Wolves almost look like an African town or something but yeah yeah that's what I'm saying the house look like a Nigerian house too yeah yeah yeah like Nigerian ones yeah all right so I I I think it's a good call I think it should be Brazil right yeah should yeah it should be okay this is Reay Union but I don't know like the reference here can I get to Rion probably okay then got plunked I don't know if I know that reference maybe that's another like probably another cheater reference that I forgot about that happened like two years ago I don't think I know this unless this is jjk is a man of uh many talents and this is probably just DK the other DK right yeah okay I kind of Meed that one not gonna lie because it was obviously Central or this part of Russia with the Gen 4 winter coverage but okay that's good so yeah I mean I told you guys that L like theet Mi this is the location the pro went turkey on and that is [ __ ] amazing oh my god dude that is amazing all right tell me tell me you guys you guys winning at you your tournament going uh turkey on this let me know I won't scores for the leaderboard on this one cuz it's kind of unfair it's just kind of like a joke day what a funny kind of like video to like tell you guys about some of the lore in the community but uh yeah let's see how everyone else does and that would be strange one um we are we driving left is my question it looks like we are but it's really hard to tell we got striped sign post as well it's not it's only in the Caribbean I think which is weird we have no fronts but I just don't think I mean this actually could just be completely miss this could be completely misplaced uh monque screw it bro no it's not monque okay poos you got it well that's an interesting one how do we end it's not the one place in Barbados is it I know is it no oh it was was wait what did the person guess in Caribbean that that was like completely wrong one one cheater okay oh it's oh bro come on what is going on here this is this is Atlantic City which is where's that bro what what is this bro oh I just remembered the date oh um oh this is this is the Snorlax location you got it I wonder how many people are going to get the Atlantic City though the moment of realization you had when you when the Atlantic City I was like that's the most iconic location of all time what the hell wait what am I looking at here bro this is some April Fool's joke or something um wait what country would it be like what do I guess I'm going to go for us virsion Islands still no it was Barbados bro I knew it's going to be some wow great guest my this is Atlantic City pretty gooded not not as a city but just as a lock the uh um oh was it the Barbados and reun reunion DK and denet denet and denet okay what's the Atlantic City in the Louisiana Atlantic City was a j wizard going Ulan on that really yes the Cambodia was Starla going Aur on okay and that was a skill test where they went turkey that's funny yeah oh man that was funny sorry I want to do something f for okay all right next day like I said I'm not going to count these as like uh what What's the word like on the leader board but I just want to see like how everyone did obviously everyone got oine from like the from when I talk to people I think like 60 to 70% people got like most of the references some people were like what happened um so it's a lot of like how in the community were you um for you to get that but uh yeah so if you guys didn't realize the 402 was like a lookalike of the 10-second actual location that people got that they like cheated or like a referen to like the video like G wizard so that's how it was broken up by jhk which is smart but denet if you know you know how many people got denet a lot a couple people did anyone go wrong denet no that's that's promising that is promising round five was Barbados Blinky got that reference okay or maybe not people they're probably so confused they're like what is this uh and then the 10sec was uh Union okay Atlantic City a lot people got that reference the OG's this is a fun little thing to do I'll probably not do it again but a little nice little break in the daily challenge one would say Cambodia re Union and uh denet okay tricker and bl or tricker and Denver it's fun fun times and this was the J or de remembered this lock from the the skill test which is funny but um sweet I hope you guys enjoyed this is something slightly different but it's fun nonetheless I had a lot of fun I don't think most people probably really understood what was happening but for me it was a good like walk down memory lane and kind of just like a fun change of pace so I'll see you guys in a more normal day tomorrow

right it's another day to play the game of you but more importantly it's another day that we get to rise and shine and use our Noggin everyone lock in wow not every day that you get to see around like this in a country like this and uh a country that I can never find on the map Bhutan okay West or sunny skies are more West right that's the meta I think maybe with sunny skies are East we'll figure that out another day round two okay we have a forest okay let's actually think about this for a second it's just a dirt road it's obviously Europe so that's the first thing we can we can negate from this because we have the back of the car here and then the obvious answer Slovenia or Austria and then after that you go to France or czechia but I'm staying in Slovenia because it feels kind of Slovenian to me it was a syian forest round three free haido arrows I'm not going to try Okay round four um okay so usually The Meta in the game with you I guess here if you guys want me to explain my thought process a little more is usually when you get the the grass Mill it's Ireland right do we stand by that [ __ ] it we ball you know me I'm all about spreading fake information if you're not spreading misinfo what are you really doing with your life um is it just Wales or the UK yeah yeah it most likely probably is but you don't win this game by by not trusting fake mans Northern Ireland that counts for something okay oh this is fun this is really fun okay so this is so fun in fact I'm about to throw a birthday party not sure where that came from okay [Music] um so the obvious answer is like from like upington to Petoria somewhere over here like maybe even up here near Gabon I don't think it's up here because it would you would start seeing more Mountains and it's kind of flat so I'm going to go to 14 here is my best guess it could be something anywhere in this area though maybe a little more East but we'll see freaking heck that's just literally downtown batswana gr Gasburg Terminus 10 seconds now so where we're going to have to start to sweat okay I'm listen I want to do well in Terminus because it's a really fun map I keep saying this I don't talk as much it's because I'm sweating this is Lanka it's easy to go Thailand on this but I'm not bad this Forest is why is it low key feel like an American Mailbox because it wasn't it was freaking mobile oh my God I'm went to school in Baldwin County over here so and uh I've been all across this Coast so kind of unfortunate I don't get that oh Lord Mexico Texas Mexico Texas Mexico [Music] Spain Texas I don't know if you guys heard that but I did say Texas lock it oh no Brazil oh no Brazil New Zealand that's not Brazil you know for the average person watching this video you'll think oh rainbolt you're cheating or why are you so surprised because that's not that good of a guess maybe I'm overhyping it but that was an insanely good yes on round four let me just go ahead let me just like bro this tree just looked Brazilian like this these trees just looked so Brazilian okay I'm not going to like that for 10 seconds that's just that's just a pat on the back you know it's okay to to to Hype yourself up sometimes okay why because in round five here I'm about to go wrong content anyways so like I can have my flowers where my flowers flowers are due okay let's lock in this is Australia or USA I think I have to go Australia [Music] here you know in 10 seconds like I theorically wouldn't really want to make that guess there but I just had I still had two seconds left I had to make a guess down so all in all one of the hardest potentially seeds on termin yet but I think one of my best performances yet yeah maybe my guesses weren't that great but no single round there besides round one was like easy I think you know maybe you know everyone else also gets this right but for me personally I I I'll take a good Brazil guess here and that's why this map is so beautiful because every single guess good guess you make it means something to you yeah oh I get a good guess and you know whatever but it's like too easy sometimes not to say say that arrogantly but like when you actually have to think there and you have 10 seconds on the clock you like that's what this game is about and that's where you get to that it feels like you're you're starting to play the game for the first time again you know it's like day one of playing it's like that buzz of like getting Country right is like that you keep chasing that's the feeling you get when you play hard maps and that's why I will always advocate for hard maps and N mpz because you do not get this and moving cringe I'm sorry n npz is the best game mode if you play the game mode else else way you should rethink your life decisions do I judge you for that no are you welcome to here still Yes will I convert you to npz eventually that's my goal bro this is the most Alabama thing I think I've ever seen in my life I mean like how close is this to Scurry Texas it's pretty far from Scurry Texas 355,000 what does that get you in the state you live in over under 1,000 sare ft oh my God this one's wait what three bed three bath with the pull and like a guest house for 276,000 that's really nice guess you're in the middle of nowhere though and the heat is probably so strong but like still look at that I'm going super by popular is there anything over a million that you can buy here oh there is there's one 1.87 million wait what is this 5.8 million oh my god dude seven bed 11 bth like what could you possibly like need this much space for is that is that an ignorant thing to say 177,000 sare f feet is like do you ever even like see the other side of your house you know all right let's see how everyone else does interesting one I kind of thought Bulgaria Slovenia Slovenian dirt road maybe it is Slovenia going to go I'm going to go Slovenia okay good kaido mean Irish Road right you don't you don't go against Irish Road Northern Iron I mean basically see I don't want to go too North it is kind of feeling North I don't know stick it there yeah it was more North damn okay we all know the big blur means Sri Lanka is that us like yeah I think so and we have like palm trees or something it's like Louisiana or Florida yeah one of the Mexico of all time Texas is of all time kind of kind of script in there but we'll take it oh this is a true Terminus location right here why did I think like kons or something no Brazil that was a good good Brazil yeah well done uh okay this one's actually Australia and it's like I keep moving North yeah I kept moving North I was like it's actually not that so damn it was those trees I think those tall trees in the back yeah yeah that that does make sense that's why I thought Australia CU they're like eucalyptus but like yeah Brazil makes sense with the rest of the this is a crazy one of the craziest like IND the dirt roads I've ever seen though like fully crash is kind of crazy like like this is what I want when I see a Terminus like when I'm when I'm popping in into a Terminus game like I want to see this location exactly this is what we play for this is what you grind for right here this is yeah exactly all right GG's all right it's next day how many people do we have finished today 25 on the dot and I got 15th Place on this one round one was Bon Bas Emily okay maybe I should click Center and consis got the right road but he got the wrong Province so everyone comment ELC consus bar Lu next time buddy round two was svenia and V might be the Slovenian goat getting almost the right Forest there okay buddy um lot people in Slovenia all over Europe makes sense not easy round three haai though boring round four was and I mied and Blinky gting ni I and Harrier well played lots of people in Ireland because of the grass gous over here swimming and uh some France and UK in it and the round five was zah Deb Gorka totic Harrier Blinky aiman V trior and I think that's Harrier yeah getting the right Road and then on the 10c which is one of my favorite games I've ever played like from a consistency standpoint I mean that just says it's all right about there that's like why I'm so proud of this game I got second place and trctor beat me by 100 points okay let's go round by round here Shri Lanka easy to get mix up if you don't see the car there with the tide poles in the background all right yeah I'm assuming a lot of Europe here yep lots of Europe kind of all over the us but super South looking trees um so makes sense around three was Texas how many people got Texas uh totic bag is that bag or yeah bag de conas almost got another ratio you saved yourself okay round four yeah I mean okay who got this right me and de and Gorka or only ones wait how did tricker beat me where did trior guess where are you trior wa am I missing his profile picture oh you guys are probably screaming at your monitor I'm not even trolling right now where did this guy guess he he had 48 points where did he guess oh he's underneath the my on a pit Ken Islands oh Adams town is actually such a goed guess wait the coverage on Adamstown is actually not a car it's like a human walking with like gray hair and it actually looks like shriker over here here like you can see like it looks like that kind of same like Road like that type of a like human head so that's that's pretty based okay and round five was Australia everyone getting that for the most part dude I threw oh my God biggest round five throw ever I had a free win and then I didn't go Queensland and that's how the cookie crumbles it's a beautiful night looking for something fun to do okay blinkie getting 14 V getting six myip getting six and tricker tricker getting four I'll take five and Gorka will take one all right I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 27.41365383641108, "lng": 90.9875749526216}, {"round": 2, "lat": 46.31820186563813, "lng":

oh fun okay this this looks fun what is this your immediate thought goes to Columbia I would say with like the puddles in the road like this it would have to be east of the andies probably what else does your mind to go to here maybe it would not really I don't really see a road like this in Mexico I don't think what else do I see here I see a Columbia that's all I really see here honestly not sure I go somewhere like North or like east of the Indies North a bit but it was west of andies but it was Columbia okay that's probably everyone probably gets that so that's easy God I lost, 1600 points on Columbia that's actually devastating um and here I want to go European turkey really badly what does that say I can't read what that says I'm gonna go European turkey here that's CU you're

right it's another day to play the game with you guys sir and it's another day to use your Noggin I'm locked in someone left a comment yesterday that like saying it's time to user Noggin is like overly used and cringe so now I'm kind of self-conscious about it I'm not goingon to lie but you know what I'm not going to let that com get to me because there's probably plenty of nice comments about my Noggin use and in honor of my Noggin use watch me to get the exact city right it it's pretty damn close round two okay so we have Peru you have to go somewhere like not where I'm going click oh Lord okay so like immediately why you just go north of Lima here like Northern Peru it's like this because it looks like that you know but like watch it just be South and then how many points lose like at least 1,800 but this looks North like it looks like it's north of Li be like somewhere even more North but I can't commit even that North because that's bad look but if this is South that's even worse look dude don't go these are BC guard rails right yeah I think I don't think BC uses guard rails it use stone blocks right that's the thing right so we'll go somewhere over here uh just Vancouver Island which is BC all right boring seed get me off this freaking seed hopefully round five is easier uh oh my God this is the most boring seed possible I'm gonna go North no I'm going to go south like somewh down here oh my God can I send that to my friends that's so boring I'm going to do one more I can't send my friends a 40 second seed like that like 40 seconds you're supposed to like actually have to think for a second this looks like something over here in Romania okay round two uh Lord we're not really off to Noggin user Noggin using thought start that's okay though one love I guess you just go like somewhere like this y one um do I go to Lux I have that Scurry song Texas song stuck in my head from the okay uh no you don't go Germany or you don't go Luxemburg here actually you might it does kind of look Luxy God damn it why do I do this to myself bro all right we're gonna cook here this looks like this city down here is it this one of these cities is it this one is that mountain South that makes sense I part of me thinks it could be like like one of these like con no that's not a big enough City maybe Rio gallus Rio I could have found [Music] that I mean in hindsight these mountains are Too Close like that was super findable like this grid too dang it 231 I mean that's a 24K seed easy like actually free 24K wait yo this is a 245 seed for someone I'm saying this because I want to see how good of a score you get Luxembourg insanely small country that's 4,900 you click like you know lowy this is free 40 245 for someone we could see a really high score here for sure I mean it's boring but like in the boring sense that like we get a really good score from someone so it's going to be content so I'll keep it all right 40 second Terminus no 10c Terminus okay I got locked in terance is not easy map but we'll make it look easy today C this is an strange East West Road well if it's like this road down here it was that road down there that was kind of cool put that in the Tik Tok edit okay um Indo Philippines [ __ ] what have I done it's like that it's like that video back in the day where it's like the guy that like I what no what was it no he had like the he had like the afro and he had like the pins in his hair and he was like [ __ ] I can't believe you've done this you guys remember that video I just had that's Peru UAE ah dude this is bad why did I go UAE on that I literally said Peru what is this car blur wait is this Panama me out of here that was a great guess oh my God that was an insane guess why did it have so many good guesses and so many bad guesses oh my God I have have you ever seen such a I tried being so cute with a ter with a Panama and the fre Lanka maybe was obvious but thought it must be Panama and then the Peru I mean this is a that's just a free Peru bro with this brick Oh my God that's actually such a free Peru with the brick why did I go U oh my God I'm cringing I'm actually I'm IRL cringing oh my God I'm cringing at me saying I'm IRL cringing this is just an infinite cringe I mean yeah that was a good that was a good really good round five guess though and really good the road right in round one but and really good Java guess I think I guess I could see myself going Philippines on this in another like 10 second round so but uh Frick dude that was the highs of highs and lows of lows but that's what this game is about if you're always getting right it's not not as fun right Co let's see what everyone else does um I think it's Romania and I would say whoa okay dude this is just okay wait a second I told youo I was locked in I was locked in wait you're actually locked in uh it's like abucha here maybe okay bro what is this actually happening actually this is surely Bavaria right please go luxg no no it's bro I actually hate have got such a good score wait does that line up it doesn't really line up wait why does it look like here bro I don't know no dude dude oh my God D I should have switched the angle didn't even make sense yeah I should have switched wait you actually should have switched but I mean you only picked up 400 points it was the Germany that you really needed um oh gosh I don't know what this is sh D you're the first person to get Sri Lanka all right it's the next day and I finally installed the select all clip or the select all Chrome extension so there you guys go is kind of sad that the amount of scripts I have to install to film one six minute video but so name the game where did we six place that's not bad no yeah this was one how many 24K only 124k okay harier pop off round one was Romania RC getting closest there couple people all over Europe there but you know Romania round two uh Focus round two was Gana look at this like little pocket of people here that's kind of cool I mean kind of look like that Region Three everyone getting Nigeria that's good super I didn't realize it was going be that close to Abuja but yeah makes sense go north yeah zigzag and S on that North Road r four Germany how many people got Lex my trctor Ziggy and D getting a really good guess there all of us in Germany it happens it happens round five where is Round oh yeah this was down here and no one went the same city as me that City didn't really line up oh man I was like so that's actually so frustrating but shout out to let me give credits to where credits do lyly aan Ziggy Blinky har totic Anna the right City there so and bagged getting third place by guessing in the water in 2 seconds this guy's trolling like he's not even trying it's like almost like disrespectful okay and then oh I got third fifth place with 13,000 points oh Lord I have to refresh to get the select I think yeah okay um did more than 25 people play no okay round one was okay me I'm the only one that got the East West Road or I guess like technically everyone got their road but it was like that portion of the road you know cuz like the road goes like all the way up Borneo but like round two um Java zigzag and Con G Java I just oh we have a lot of we have a couple Columbia Peru Philly Thailand yeah this is not an easy lock at all at all round three was per I fumbled this bro okay Aman's there with me I fumbled if I get 4,000 points let's say 3,000 points I I I mean no I probably would have got like top I wouldn't change my place with that much Blinky or RC won by 2,000 points so but yeah click Lima where did what happened to Blinky around four you got zero what was round oh this is the Sri Lanka yeah no one got Sri Lanka besides RC not a single person got Sri Lanka besides RC how many people went pan with me a ton ner is also notable guess yeah that's yeah that's shout to RC for getting that one and then yeah this is kind of har are getting six points Ziggy getting nine I saw the comment yesterday thank you and bag getting bag getting four uh and then RC getting six conest getting five and Blinky getting four um all right let's see what placement

not sure if you guys got the memo or not but today's a good day to use your Noggin round one this is Ser by a pavement if you get that right you're just like why is their surviv pavement doing okay this is going to be someone's going to end up getting that right I have never looked the coverage on that island uh do a Germany here I guess God I'm so brainwashed I'm literally looking at the like [ __ ] copyright and not the landscape someone stopped me okay this looks Baltic obviously the question is do you go laia I don't think this is a lvan sign it doesn't look like they're red is thck enough so I'm going to go but these poles this looks like a Lithuanian pole here but these poles look Lavan but I'm going to go lethani or I'm going Northern Lithuania oh okay um it's the us obviously it looks sou South obviously um like I don't think it's Alabama but like I can see it being like I I I see like a Mississippi Louisiana like Florida like weird Florida like somewhere like like this in the Panhandle or like there's race track where tracks I this Moss stuff just screams like this Southern if it's more North H I don't know yeah that's a great guess that's a great guess and New Zealand with water East with mountains first step is to find New Zealand on the map you can do it God I don't know anything about New Zealand this is actually bad like that is only thing I can while you're East in New Zealand's kind of crazy with mountains like what unless it's like I don't think it's over that South should be somewhere up here [ __ ] it we ball nice what that road okay I popped off I actually really popped off that was a really good game almost unbeatable I would say that was Georgia okay so I guess Florida okay all I knew it was like the Tri Point somewhere um I'm going to check to see if this place do all the roads here have survive pavement I mean one of those things where like you see it yeah they do you see this it's just the main roids yeah I'm remember this what this looks like so I can okay all right fair enough all right 10 seconds on Terminus though this is where like I just need one one really good game here which is not easy but to pop off and hopefully [ __ ] dude um Poland no what the hell France [ __ ] dude that's the biggest hill in Netherlands right that's like the highest elevation in Netherlands what are we playing here brother right over here Lord this looks Southern again really dude oh my God what is this this looks like the UK or something maybe like a weird France Belgium but should be like the UK okay is this Russia or I don't know where I don't know I don't know what this is Texas oh [Music] bro you have to stop the reduci of coping okay now let's go and let's Analyze This I also have an ad read after this so I can't be tilted in an ad read who the [ __ ] goes Texas what is this map Scurry Texas sounds like a dog's name population of 681 Good Vibes Ranch in Scurry [Music] Texas I can't be mad at Scurry Texas bro they got they got Good Vibes I can't say mad at [Music] them [Music] the reason Jesus the reason Jesus for this season okay bro can we learn some typography like that is just not how you would read that you would never read the reason for the season and then [Music] like [Music] yo Scurry Texas is full of Good Vibes what the hell hey yo yeah what's going on in Scurry is that where Steph Curry's from all right let's see what everyone else does all right we're back and pvpn is a back it's going to be another very quick add read guys it's going to be a very another quick add read guys but quickly if you guys know what a VPN is it's basically a virtual private Network so that you can put your device anywhere in the world that you choose and then your device thinks you're there so if you want to make it look like you're in Stockholm when you're chill you know in SE Rapids you can do that you get 83% off with the link in my description and you get four months free and with One login or one account you get unlimited devices it's extremely based I've said this a million times before but VPN are amazing they encrypt your data they hide your IP the J searches are especially good if I'm trying to watch like you know an NBA game or something like that back in the US because it's kind of hard to watch NBA and sports and Thailand sometimes with like different blackouts and things like that from games but thank you to pvpn for sponsoring the da Challenge Series and let's get back to the video I wasn't home to record RC's P so I told him if he wanted to record one I'll watch it so let's he sent me a video I don't know what it is but all right it's another day to play Guster but more importantly it's another day to have a privilege to use your Noggin let's lock in this guy oh he even left me the space put my camera that's so nice of him I hope you enjoy that oh my God [ __ ] you have to love RC bro you have to what R pment he's gonna say it will he go Island um I guess it's Indonesia and it's with this payment I would think it's East Java I don't know I was confused for a second CU I didn't know what the language was like Loki almost looked like Spanish or something but no no I didn't see that um yeah I mean this is s a bi a pavement so slam it in oh wait it's that one Island okay yeah that one island has like that road that goes around that has this pavement I forgot about that I literally just that makes so much sense I feel like every time I try and learn something RC says it to so they're like oh um this is is this I kind of like Lux here yeah I I want to try Lux okay it was actually Germany I mean that's fine yeah more points than me going Germany that's crazy I don't know Lux Germany I'm like deserve first like not I have a very hard score to beat so I okay I think but he is from Georgia too and there's a Georgia lock so maybe see is it like lith or is it Estonia I want to say it's lith okay good was oh wait right should be Georgia I think [ __ ] Georgia outer lines dude or outer reflectors I could have gotten good score this would be it's feeling kind of Southwestern I feel like maybe um that's actually devastating yeah like this type of tree I don't know feels more Southern I I still got a good score but I could got really good score um yeah I wish I knew the road but I don't so we're just gonna go there okay yeah right on the border actually but to be fair Florida has him too so my guess is valid and last round New Zealand we have the Ballard he B I feel like I should know this Bay but I don't um there's some mountains there maybe like this or something um what else would work does anything else really work I kind of like where I am so I might just give that a try maybe yeah I think let's see okay nice it was there no way he's beat me by 13 points wait 12 what the okay okay got first 23k um hope rainbow enjoyed that I did but like I would have enjoyed first place like one Terminus um 10 seconds for round lock in uh I thought NL maybe with this like red and white thingy and like on the coast cuz it looks s no okay it was yeah I guess that makes sense with like the slight elevation change I thought it looked like Sandy and Coastal but cope um is this UAE I guess maybe I mean with all this sandiness right yeah okay good uh looks like the US um it's like maybe East Coast or something off I'm going to try New Jersey oh okay Pennsylvania that's pretty good that's pretty good we will take that he's he's going to blunder oh no what is this okay so we have like a weird roof some ferns maybe France maybe galsia oh no we have a chimney maybe it's England oh no dude I wanted to click last second England he was yeah I saw the chimney that makes sense saw Santa Claus coming to town okay he doesn't get scur Texas here that's for damn sure it's like Sask or something Bas gu like Alberta Sask I feel like no it's just Texas a man um I think the yeah the sign with the yield actually makes is a American sign but I didn't think about it in the moment yeah when it says yield like that but no where you know tough oh tough yeah I mean all right I guess also the redder soil but that's just a cope very cool location though all right say bye to us peace okay bye RC all right it's the next day or the same day as I'm recording the video with RC or I us RC's video but listen this might be one of the best like my favorite episodes of all time I mean it literally had everything it had RC scripting to beat me we had a random Scurry Good Vibes we had we had some meditation we had a voice crack like what more do you want for me okay who got this right uh zigzag mackam and Jacob congrats round two everyone else got Ser by pavement round two okay I'm glad oh no this I'm glad people went Germany with me because I thought this was a Terminus round where it's the Netherlands okay um because I think Alo went no one went Doo dorf where did Ziggy go did zig play no okay bro um or he just Rage Quit round three Lithuania all these middle hedgers I want you try being Alpha like me up here in the north real Georgia Florida guessers here RC being the closest there they on five how many people got the road here buzzy the New Zealand lad himself J mackam trior Blinky and Toro got the 5K Blinky and Toro I think and then the 10 second oh Lord consis getting first place and zigzag and trick turn I got 15th Hey listen you win some you lose some go round one yeah okay I guess maybe Netherlands was getable I don't know I used see a hill I used to immedately don't go Netherlands like I guess we were maybe in a divot but UAE Northeast us they have a lot of people going south like I think that looked felt more Southern like I'm not sure how RC picked up on those vibes just he's just better RC tried switching last second here but yeah with the sasz it wasn't really winable but tons of man TOA Sask Alberta so that is validating and I actually thought the Russia like my thought it was Russia too with how big and wide that dirt road was like I just and there's like a pipe in the distance it looked Russian but shout out to everyone that went to Texas I'll take six r RC gets 11 and my gets five and then 10 seconds we have consis getting his first three and definitely not his last zigzag getting four and tricker getting one and I will see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1,

down here but more forested which would not make sense it's too forested but I'm going to go where is it this foresty South it looks South a little more North okay sure oh okay we have a forest this is a Swedish Forest surely Southern Sweden potentially um yeah I mean I guess it could be North oh do I want to go north actually I kind go a little it looks like Twilight you know like Twilight Vibes lowkey kind give me Northern Vibes but just reading for it look the same I'll take that okay you go Iowa here or do you go I think you have to go Iowa here you go Illinois you see Illinois or Illinois Illinois I'm more of an Illinois guy actually I think Illinois I think you might go Iowa though is there Iowa pavement I think it might be Iowa pavement there's little noise me when I try to act like a n oh what the hell okay so they spell Center wrong that means they stupid and live in the UK okay Garden Center I'm just kidding I'm not really that kidding okay let's think yeah I mean why am I acting like region get a parking lot in the UK this is a we'll go north [Music] Northampton swinden barbecue garden center with Barb I thought a garden center with barbecue like wow they were like at the backyard out here what's B andq within B andq is it like the Home Depot I thought that said barbecue Swindon oh man and Russia short antenna I need to look at the antenna dock in Russia but it looks West near Moscow I think actually maybe over here this could be a really bad guess actually I think but maybe a little more East near uh like this yeah I'm not really too sure to be honest it looks somewhat northernness but we'll see I'm okay with this score regardless unless it's Max East okay I mean you win some you lose some erra 20K pretty standard C two russes should just went Illinois UK Sweden yeah pretty standard pretty pretty standard nothing really to cope about there but this is where the coping begins let's do this 10 seconds on the clock Terminus lock in if I don't talk as much during these it's because I'm really locked in and not because of anything else because I really just want to do well because this is a very hard okay Taiwan Indo guess I go Taiwan that's just a great guess that's just a great guess all around load is this guitar U oh my god dude I just got the right parking lot on accident what is happening I mean that was just completely luck but like this Russia is there ever Weir no say I thought there's Alaskan pipeline in the back but I'm just going to go somewhere near Russ what am I what am I actually am I just like the best player to ever play this game in [Music] like Austria Slovenia czechia svenia Slovenia I think Slovenia I like a lot no I like check here Sakia more I think [ __ ] I realized last second I think it was s or check yeah what that's a grab grab is tie wait do they have grab in Philippines oh my God [Music] that was I mean like what more do you want from me that was just an amazing game and like I didn't call Sakia but like I just have to give myself like round of the Applause for that one that was just earned that was just man that makes me emotional that's just years of practice right there honestly like not to be cringe but like that [ __ ] was not easy okay so I'll talk you through my Sakia process here we resume like this and usually like this gen for like coverage I usually think Slovakia or uh Slovenia but we could see the roof of the house right here felt more Slovakian like very last second I looked like more czechia Slovakia that really also but yeah I still think svenia is a fine guess here honestly and that Taiwan guess it had in the beginning is just one of the it's not easy it's just not easy at all like you're literally just looking at trees dude like if I don't win this seed like Blinky is like actually an OP like on like on everything like I deserve to win this but I blundered my Slovakia so let's see how everyone else does all right 10 seconds let's get it let's see if we can match Trevor good game oh shees oh no oh no oh well I think I think it's actually Tai or Philippines so let good time okay nice whoa okay buddy yeah I I saw the kind of like grainy kind of Taiwanese Pavement in the last second like the the the the vegetation had zero clue and then I looked at the road okay we're good oh oh no 23 I think it it looks more like katar but it could be uao go here okay nice oh oh we're very neck and neck yeah wait okay oh okay we have Birches I think I really don't want him to beat me bro I really don't I thought of donet okay yeah I don't think this bud is in done yet actually but I yeah I have to go TOA yeah um is it is Austria the main thing that came to mind Slovakia okay okay okay and that looks like right here I can in in the town of nuga okay damn g g you popped off you did it was dude you scar me there for a second though that Russia yeah it's be my score is be though I think actually actually I think it is Russia I was just putting Kazakhstan kind of everything looks like Russia but um gen through Kazakhstan is my favorite bro dude okay I was playing the Alo Kazakhstan map and there was a literally a Chell clock so it was uh quite funny maybe like Samar actually I'll try that no was s or V like my only other thought is czechia but surely not this like I seen coverage like this near Stockholm but I don't know if I want to go that far north yeah know where are the outside lines bro what this is rather strange I don't know oh no okay Garden Center free uh welln Garden City where cooking this looks like per Mev thing somewhere over here this no that's not that car um sorry I'm trying too hard on this round oh wait what it was that road dude dude I swear I thought that road had a different car okay maybe not maybe I'm think this road I think maybe I don't know damn all right it's next day bag first Jers Axel and Toro dude Toro is one one placement away from being his first ever points I got 16th with 20,000 points kind of crazy all right let's keep it going also I'm keeping my AC on because it's too hot so if you don't like the White Noise I'm sorry we'll be quick round one Russia lot people getting the road there J great guess holy crap amazing guess round two was Sweden Southern Sweden round three any Iowa enjoyers Yeah couple Illinois Indiana getting a lot points you Indiana there yeah all kind of in the Corn Belt UK boring didn't we get swind in nope and then round five was just another Rush yeah this was my downfall I guess I guess I should went more East and I finally did it I think this is the first time I've got in first place in like three months so we'll take it 18 people finishing this one round one Taiwan me Axel trior zigzag and me getting that to round two where did everyone else go we probably had toit southeast Asia yeah all Indo Philly Japan Thailand Qatari yeah I mean that was just a lucky guess round three Russia I mean this is a Beat will score in hindsight because they they had a way better rushia guess than I did so my a great guess where did my place yeah third mess up in around four though wait what was R oh oh yeah no one got Slovakia you know not to cope but I did call Sakia out last second just saying round five was Philippines bag getting three on the 42nd that's his first points on the 32nd Gill getting uh four and Axle getting one and then for the 10

right it's another day to play the game with you guys for but more importantly it's another day to have the privilege to use their Lin hopefully everyone's locked in 40 seconds on the clock I am round one what is this I do not like parking lots Malaysia Indonesia I get more Malaysian Vibes than I do Indonesian Vibes here have to be Mainland with water North which is kind of weird though because then now I want to go Indonesia because of that I mean that's just an amazing just kind of that's just you just kind of have to think about it deduct deductive reasoning and just you get there in the end that's that's just what we like that's the duty of the game right there you have to earn that right round two looks like polish trees sure let just pull in right what else could this be I mean it could be maybe a weird Baltic actually could be weird Baltic actually this house is feel more polish to me though but this could be Baltic for sure but I think this road quality and this like this off-road is more polish nice and that's a great guess okay Netherlands okay water East it should be North right I'm committing North because what if it is North if it's like that is that even in the Netherlands it is okay water on the other side I don't know we'll go somewhere up here we're we're going I mean this is this could be the most Point's ever lost in the Netherlands oh what if it's like down here somewhere just Amsterdam yeah I mean in hindsight there's really not that many places of small bodies of water like canals in the Netherlands so it would be pretty easy to find something like that considering there's a very lack of kind of what okay you have to Slovenia here then okay so we have the Austria svenia ballards right but this pole doesn't really feel like this doesn't feel like like it feels like it should be Austria but like what is this what is this everything just feels more selenian to me like maybe you go Northern svenia round four uh no be round four choke I'm playing pretty well uh yeah I mean I guess this roof kind of looks we'll [Music] see I just I just need to start clicking capital I click Amsterdam I guess Amsterdam's not Capital but big cities what a cons spice cons spice what a concise what a I don't know what I'm trying to say what is this I mean obviously it's anal but I kind of want to go and just like balls to the wall like a crazy guess also the next map we're going to play on 10 seconds is about to really like brain F like all of us I'm kind of hyped I forgot it existed but now I I I kind of want to go like up here near like St [Music] Louie what I I should click capital 232 wait that's actually kind of cracked I mean that Malaysia guess is gble easy seed easy easy seed but definitely we'll have a couple 24K so this will not do it because you click CER Poland you click Capital you click Capital you click Amsterdam and you click even if you click K here you get like maybe a 24K so life goes on but in honor of making it more [Music] difficult we are playing Terminus if you guys don't know what Terminus is basically it's a it's a map that only shows you locations at the end of roads where the coverage ends so you're always facing an mpz a dead end where the coverage ends or the road ends guess Dead End Road ends same thing it's mainly very difficult and I will probably cope a lot it also does have the new Kazakhstan coverage so I have to keep an eye out for that as well I have to go Bali here I think lowkey bro like just absolutely lock the [ __ ] in just lock in Peru oh Lord Peru I don't know anything else besides [Music] Peru France UK Netherlands Belgium I like Belgium Netherlands if it's DeMark I'm lock in Kenya surely Northern Kenya [Music] I never get that road right oh Lord um looks like this region of Brazil I guess maybe it could be more North something up in the whs could this be I hope it's right use your [ __ ] Noggin yeah I went Mexico but do you see what changed the mentality did I cope no I kept going like it didn't bother [Music] me what an amazing performance there by by by your the person you're watching on YouTube right now I mean what I mean what more do you want for me I will keep in mind guys I'm going to play another seed this is how hard this this [ __ ] map is okay 19k round one listen oh [ __ ] Bulgaria Romania ah uh Russia maybe h this is Oklahoma I'm the goat oh this is wrong continent oh this is oh bwana Franc town oh that was getable wait guys I'm lowy actually good this game what the hell well I mean I kind of [ __ ] up my Europe there and I probably could up I'm addicted and I just can't get enough I think about every night and day what this is Netherlands would that be crazy okay guys I'm lowkey cooking what is this should get the same area I suck at L am I'm going bivia this Greece wait what is this Malta it's not Malta right random some alter right but yeah I'm happy with this yeah maybe I messed up on EX it's it's okay it's okay this is top 10 I I think someone gets 20K here 22k probably but all things I had a couple good guesses that I will not drown out my performance rall and I cannot wait until we can play 40 second Terminus and this will probably be the main map I use on this channel for a while because it's [ __ ] fun and I will probably cope a lot but listen Ron content sometimes is fun there's okay this is let me hear me out getting a good guess on maps you actually have to use your nogin is so much more rewarding because when you're like oh it's just South Africa let's click Victoria you get no dopamine from that but when you're like wait what is this and you click middle of nowhere Brazil and you get it right dopamine like here it's just the best thing ever okay so we will keep this up and let's um see how everyone else does bro Terminus on 10 seconds cheater what the hell sorry was that did that saki wasn't it saki that did that yeah he did like four times though no I don't know I was thinking like something crazy like Malaysia maybe like what about like an island like this or something is that crazy yeah I mean it's not there I don't know I'm definitely wrong country it's fine okay it was Malaysia actually it was what's an island C okay I think yeah I think it should be Poland why is there like an orchard here what does that mean um I don't know it means a click W yep okay all right is this a Northern or a southern Canal or a middle Canal Amsterdam Canal okay oh it's really okay wait I didn't know they had these poles I guess it's Austria I mean I don't think it's so IIA right so yeah just chill in like Northern Austria I was Slovenia damn okay I think it's I think it's just here okay yeah go just like B how is this Terminus yeah right oh this looks like Guan yeah I think hopefully okay pretty good it was holis but fine what is this I have no idea what that sign is why do I think UK oh it's Belgium okay Kenya I thought like oh where's Kenya I thought like here somewhere okay or decid to just click off the road make it less yeah I don't know why um um what is this like weird Brazil like here or something it's just Coastal yeah I mean yeah fifth not bad I was expecting some like real Terminus stuff where all you see is like like one house like the end of the dirt road I mean we'll get there we have plenty of weeks to get there okay this is a yeah all right it's next day and gelus getting second to Ziggy and snil pretty standard seed one would say so nothing too crazy here everyone getting you know 20 22k here so kind of a boring seed and yeah zigging 24K round one was Malaysia yeah I don't know what made me possessed to go there but these guesses are way more valid considering it was an island I saw water North here I was like that looks good okay round two do go into on that no okay pretty good round two Poland round three uh Netherlands boring boring austri syia 5050 and round five was boring this absolutely just boring but the new Terminus 10 seconds Blinky got 24K oh Lord have mostly Missle what are we looking at here bro how do you get 24K on this round round one Bali everyone getting a lot of people getting Bali shout out to all the Bal enjoyers on two okay Bas myips and snail my brothers this is why you know just just all around great Lads shout out to the people going backx here trior amazing guys trior trior trior wait where did Blinky go here kind of a bad guys blink I'm not gonna lie me personally I would go Peru round three it's Belgium only four people got Belgium four other people that's good Poland Germany or Germany czechia UK US I think I saw Belgium baller to be fair wow RC cheater moment Blinky in the road snail in the road tood getting super close damn base de breakas base ziky and em guess and bag I think that's bag or someone um round five was oh get [ __ ] Blinky yeah okay you might get 24K but you'll never take this away from me um lots of Colo here lots of Brazil L people going more south than Rio but well good game all arounds by everyone and tomorrow do not expect 20ks on this map because it will probably be a lot more difficult the seeds are pretty hard so all right for the 4 second we have Ziggy getting seven gelus getting his first two Jus went through and played the other challenge things he could probably get really high because there's been so much turkey and S getting six there's been so much turkey all right and then starting this one off whoops Blinky getting three de two and Harrier getting one and I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

right it's another day to play the game you guys for more importantly it's another day to have the privilege to use our login hopefully everyone's locked in I am round one let me think about where this would be probably just something like this right a little more south okay oh that Park that makes sense where did I is Northern one or close Okay um I have a confession to make though I have a confession to make I have not played the game of GS in four days you're probably wondering how I've seen you upload the past four days well you can probably tell they're pretty scuffed and you I haven't been able to get really anyone on that's because they were pre-recorded I'm sorry this is not I will un full screen and show you the date right now it's 3:22 okay let me reing guys Thailand real quick I want to do good here I think it's just like something over here I I really have Ste my game up on on on Thailand all right confession I've been in Norway for the past two days yeah I went to Norway for two days you're probably wondering why did you go to Norway for two days wow dude what is this the Google card just headed to hit with a quick selfie bro that's kind of sick um that's that's actually one of the hardest photos ever wait what the hell that's actually like insanely tough like dude there needs to be like a street view car like Tik Tok edit just like fan cam edit of like Street new cars Act [Music] Right feel my spiritual healing anyways I went to Nori for two days I went to L hammer and um Oso mainly little hammer for two days because I got invited to go to a snowball to compete in a snowball fight um for Red Bull with fortnite oh Mr Savage invited me and it was a bunch of fortnite guys it was really fun it was really really fun um shout out to thank you Mr Savage for inviting me I got to meet like llin and Mong girl a bunch of fortnite players Bros n rocks um where am I zooming in really really cool time to meet everyone um and I got to you know

yeah I got my snowball on yeah but I got to meet llan but photo here Mr Savage where is this this is ever like this should be this road right more south um yeah like Mong girl all of them it was really really cool to I think like with Jas it's hard sometimes you feel like you're you're in your little bubble out here sometimes you know so it's hard to meet other people especially when the J scene isn't really that big outside of a couple people all right I thought is this what is this is this I thought this is Germany but there's like is that ever yellow plate and it's just Lux uh I think I think it should just be Germany why do these trees have guardrails like this okay um yeah that was a pretty boring seed but I did really well it did okay um but yeah oh man I suck at telling stories and concentrating I went to nor for two days to meet to compete in snowball tournament with reel Norway videos coming on Mr Savage's Channel yeah I'm basically a fortnite guy now if you guys want fortnite tips I will wke you and get full box kids okay yep but yeah I'm super bad at telling stories and playing this game at the same time because it's hard to concentrate on both and your thought process but we're going to lock in and hopefully do well here again um but yeah I'm back now this is oh I have 10 seconds I hope that's Belgium okay um yeah yeah it's um I'm back it's 322 24 okay as you're seeing this is 323 or maybe 322 um but yeah shout out to Mr Savage and thank you to Red bu nor for putting on the event I'll let you guys know when the video is live and you guys can was there water in that I'm coping I I have to really lock in isir big mountains there wow um but yeah so hopefully oh this is that red car like over I don't know I used to remember seeing this red car over here in vic but it's probably not there anymore oh it's bigo oh maybe it was the bigo red car um probably I knew it was somewhere in vic though oh another turkey we're just getting a lot of turkey today what is this looks Northern I'm just guessing say wow it looks May when Northern I guess Santa Cruz to end it off boring boring day but that's okay because I need to get back in the groove of things probably the nine I switched to the nine bro that's so cringe it was north south um but yeah pretty solid day I'm back though I'm back and um the data challenges we have hopefully people in them again you'll get RC's POV hopefully after this and yeah thank you Red Bull and nor and hopefully I get to stay in the warmth for a little bit longer but let's see how everyone else does we're back it's been too long we're back we're so back oh man um why is the card blur weird I think it's just like showing weird like kind of feels like Thailand but the pole is weird wait no it's a Cambo pole I'm stupid actually wait okay um I don't know it looks like really weird so I guess I would go like Coastal or something yeah okay now it's actually tent um it's a tough one it's a tough one I would say like here somewhere oh well I don't know why I see that um just Taiwan right yeah feels slowy Northern but let me assess that Vibe nah I think I just go middle I was bro I didn't want to commit I want to say this is not too far from Gabon maybe it's like this round or something okay that's first place okay okay we have a German Ballard here it's got an interesting sort of vibe is that a b or a type I think it's B type um I don't know I'm feeling like here somewhere probably oh it's up there third third I can win right if what what do I need to get first or what is the wait look at that yeah on 17 so if you get first here you but contas has 19 and bag has 18 or yeah oh my God okay L I'm not I'm not going to say anything lock in what if what if I get first get second gets third it's not that far either okay yeah lock all right right actually not sure what this is it's like Belgium yeah I realized last second it was Belgium that's fine uh where would this be I'm kind of feeling a more West like oh it was so West uh Vic pole I guess and you probably go somewhere over here okay more Central um it feels weird that's why I kind of want to go down here oh it was kind of South okay what is this Bolivia that was my first thought I'm going to go here okay good he has 16 so he actually can't yeah but he it could be 19 19 19 or something bro yeah that would make for some content that would be content all right yeah but like it's like one of those things were like that third can quickly be 10th you know with yeah it's a 20K plus easy seed you know all right it's the next day Blinky consis and Gorka wait does that mean someone wait did con I think cons just wait no this is a 40 wait no this is a 10c okay looks like cons one to 10 second let's we'll make sure though only 16 people finishing today let's see what happens round one Belgium lot people Belgium round two turkey round lots of Southern gu is there yeah round three was Vic round I don't know why I was so caught up on thinking that was red car and even if it was red car like red car like New Gen for Australia in so many places all right Southern turkey I'm glad I got some Northern Vibe guessers with me there um but no one really getting that close there and round five was just uh Santa Cruz and then for the 42nd aan thetic and trctor let's see how where did round one was Thailand or Cambodia maam getting the park right everyone getting Cambodia round two see off bad White Noise aan great guess everyone getting kind of the right region in Thailand there around three Taiwan easy I mean this

is a little more competitive 40 seconds goes to aan with seven to with seven and trior with 10 and then by golly Blinky with 19 con with 21 and Gorka with eight and that is a final shout out to conses for winning let's do a little make it pretty something like that sweet all right we we'll switch the map up we'll play different I think I want to go back to like a more rural map so it's like a lot more more difficult so I can like I'm kind of wanting to go continent wrong a couple times again you know like let's make it a little more difficult for us shall we um and let's do um yeah let's do that so if you guys have any map suggestions maybe is is De playing these we could do a balanced World de's playing these all right we'll see we'll see if he has any hard blocks or hard recommendations for maps maybe like a aw dirty World maybe again we'll see but sweet I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 53.7130874987488, "lng": 12.450891136283552},

right it's another day to play the game of Jer and more importantly it's another day we get to have the privilege to use our nogin hopefully everyone's locked in round one will load Let's Do It um is this po valley it should be po valley pretty free po valley one would say little more south okay that's a fine guess at around too Noggin enforce okay Bulgaria is my first guess here I guess I'm not sure where else I would go here I can't read but looks like that could be that doesn't look Latin it looks CC so I like Bulgaria and then I would go probably North somewhere up here I guess it could be down here or even like I'm GNA go s somewhere over here let's go in this highway the [Music] 81 just Southeast I quite frankly couldn't have had a worst guess that's okay um you go Austria Slovenia I think you go Slovenia here doesn't really look that much like Austria but it does actually at the same time so a safe guess is like here because I think it could be either I don't think it's a I don't think it's s anymore though so I'm G to go Center maybe even like up here I'm G to commit you have to you have to commit like this I mean I'm getting the country right but I'm just the fact people can get more points going svenia is kind Skyline North this looks like a random like is that like Regina or like Winnipeg North you know like what is this or what other Skyline is that I don't know my Skyline is like that in Canada um it could be like even like adminon or something but I doubt it's outward it right could be oh I don't know what this is I don't know I'll stay here it was Calgary okay I just assume it was Edmonton but did get Alberta but we'll take that I need to learn my skylines apparently that's something that would be helpful okay I kind to go here somewhere over here West Russia obviously um for winter yeah this is pretty distinct though it could be like this too you know something like this I don't think it's that South though I think it's more likely to be like something like this so let's stay here F gr all right 215 that's not that's fine that's fine I didn't really have any blunders po valley good call I mean I just origin guessed every country horribly or like I was just slightly off and every I would call like a good call and just get slightly off but sheesh all right 10 seconds on the clock let's do this this loky looks like south southern Arkansas like I can't move my could you hear my cursor I was trying to go more West and I couldn't move it anyone don't see that I was like literally the game is praying on my downfall wait this is a crazy Switzerland if this is Switzerland yeah it is wait where does it look like that in Switzerland right there I guess okay lock lock in you go Borneo if this is mainland if this is mainland I mean it looks the obvious answer is Russia but this is not it looks like a Slovakia or like nice oh my God if I just clicked Mainland and my game would let me switch to Western Arkansas that would been so many points Rich Mountain Mina my there's Dallas yeah let's see how real does all right like I said yesterday I have to do these at night um so let's keep it going I got 15th Place on this one where did I go wrong where did I go wrong V in first place with 239 round one was it okay everyone going po valley there so far so good Bulgaria I went to North I should went South okay everyone gting Bulgaria though that's good round four RC is the closest most the closest in Slovenia everyone get Austria some of these German war just look fake racks seems like a great place to live rack wait is that rack city wait bro we [ __ ] found Rack City holy [ __ ] I need to go to Austria bro who wants to pull up to racks okay um Calgary CG trior zigzag totic M anyone in Edmonton oh Bas Edmonton guess there's up there and then yeah all over the place round five was volr probably yep RC and V getting closer I think I just need to start cing ball the gr there if I keep getting it and then the 10 second okay let's see I did I got Arkansas oh my God if I could just go more West than Arkansas that's gonna make me sad I think I got first and most points and uh trick beat me my 12 points all right let's see where they went round one was okay oh bad I got 4700 but he was in oklahomo doesn't count lot people getting Arkansas there though based round two we won't look at that RC don't worry Switzerland lcam round three what is this oh my God so many Borneo guessers but base Jacob bag mackam RC totic and Oscar round four Spain gor dude gor might no one even holds a flame to this guy in Spain I don't think maybe in this Spanish Community they're not be someone with this guy I don't think he's never not been closest on a Spain guess like and then Slovakia that was kind of a harder soak I'm surprised more people didn't go Russia I guess they didn't really look like Russia but great people getting a lot of people getting soak there great guess with church RC specifically and bad getting 2330 I think if these standing stand we might have a winner I know conest hasn't played yet so we'll be back I know the videos recently have been a little bit shorter but we'll be back

right it's another day to play the game with you guys it's also another day to have the privilege to use our nog hopefully everyone's locked and I am round one bbon and schwind okay that will not be possible to find bbon I mean it looks Bavarian Bach shut up know where Bach is B bachy somewhere down here surely right balling in all I do is ball is over there botach findable that is findable if you're looking in the right place yo why does this look like a crazy location this like Seria or something you like Serbia or do you go north I think you go Serbia like a weird nice okay that's getable pretty easy with no ant round three do you ever go that one is stonan Island could be I'm going try it is it anything other Baltic potentially is Lithuania laia potentially we have a blur is that Lithuanian blur ever could be do I like guessing this island here yes I'm going go this one though yeah it was just just Mainland technically Estonia round four that's about as many points as you could possibly lose on Estonia this is this is about to have a round floor blunder here this is like a weird gutter wait what is this it's like Argentina or Europe what is this PO this looks like a white I thought it was a us but like this gutter does not feel like American I don't know what I don't know what continent we're in this isn't looking like anything in Argentina either though dude I don't know what I'm doing I'm just happy I got I mean I didn't know where else to get besides us there honestly like that I just didn't know like I'm okay with losing that early getting 3,000 points there this looks like let do the here like something down here I think nice okay played well it was in GDs I played that well um I lost I mean this is about getting losing 800 points on stonia is crazy but hey that happens and then that was Nebraska I went Kansas Missouri that's fine I think I where I guess probably doesn't make any sense geographically but I I didn't know where to guess I honestly didn't even think it was the US Germany someone could find that that could be a 5k if you're like Blinky or someone so that's a free 800 points for them so hopefully like top five or 10 on that but hopefully I can get top three or something okay rounds one Norway presumes like this I will never reach and guess Norway correctly and that's okay got laia here was Estonia sure um K East West looks like one of these roads nice what's that road we'll take it dude my I had like three seconds so D that was almost a colossal my internet like okay okay I don't know what this is I go pull in here I think this is like polish architecture I think it looks weird though wait what's The Pedestrian sign no that's not pedestrian sign okay was just over there by Germany oh my God that was almost really funny I had like three seconds to guess because my thing my internet wouldn't load all right well horrible I mean this is yeah I don't place here I got to get K Road call out Miss this Baltic roulette and mess up my nor region guess but all things pretty standard again pretty standard seed but we'll see uh if someone else can someone can probably 23k this so we'll see all right for the next two days I won't be able to record in the morning so I have to do these at night but I told him that everyone I give him seven hours to play but I won't collect the scores until like a day of passes so I won't update the score sheet but we will theorically see who is in first after seven hours of giving them the chance to play round one was Germany tricker is German he lives in Germany and he did find bubach and or maybe it was just a good guess but he was there in the in the B found essenbach food isn't it food Essen fight s round two Serbia no antana we got a couple people in Serbia couple people in Italy couple people in ctia couple people one in no everyone in ctia Italy round three Estonia do anyone go an island with me Gorka goat Gorka mod if you have Gorka in your chat please mod this guy and we have we have de heding Estonia laia in the water couple Sweden and Baltic and Fort okay I'm glad that people didn't think that was the us because yeah that was a weird Us in my opinion it was just Nebraska not too bad r five was just mgds I think I had a good guess here and Linley had a really good guess too zigzag RC and de sorry I have to go through these real quick 18 people finishing this one pretty quickly we got fourth right now let's see round one Norway no went that north harrier is closest up there yeah nor is impossible round two it's actually not that hard wait where did De go did De finish he did de's really good Norway so I take his guess whoever he guessed I got 3100 points what's his profile where's oh there it is he's in Bergen yeah okay this guy fell off I'm just kidding ter love you Estonia only three people in Estonia ma Axel and I think that's Chumley Chum goat round three was Kiran didn't we get the right Road five people did Gorka totic de Jacob bag myself everyone getting Kyan round Fort Finland click Center click on the literally click on the word Finland you get 5K and round five was Poland I think these are the Polish housing like the brick hous or like the flat top houses so lots of people getting that yeah I know it's dark and it's not typical I'll be back and you guys will know why shortly hopefully but let's um I'll

going to go down here like this province just Sani or PNA all right standard day I would say nothing too crazy all countries are probably obvious there so you can't really complain too much yeah that wasn't really much to cope about there but maybe we'll find a reason to cope on the 10 seconds round one oh this is essay I think this looks Sandy is it ever like Mount gambir like over here it's just Victoria okay we'll take it looks like this like region Russia slightly like something maybe even like over here I like this a lot actually not that much but we'll take it still 4,000 points fun US

trust it let me go somewhere over here these trees look weird though it's north okay this is interesting it looks like a Baltic looking Russian Finland like somewhere in like this geographical sphere I think I might go laia and just kind of hope for the best though there looks like a pole there's a pole right there and it looks like my me I thought was Russia but it looks more Baltic now maybe it's like Eastern like laia or something Western laia yeah I'm glad I can reg against laia that's a great skill set I have here that's really really doing well here and I'm just going Western turkey here I think obviously I mean I don't know where it is in Turkey but it's turkey somewhere little more North okay man Ontario kind of that hurts the Ontario one hurts I I thought it was going to be a bigger Road I didn't think it was going to be one of these um it was going to be like the 11 I don't think it was going to be a smaller road but I guess it is still yellow all right 10 seconds let's

Albania here not I'm gonna go Monty it's going to be Albania though no yeah nice great great great raging rage guessing there um okay so do you go do you go down here we're kind of cooking right now or you go up here I think you go down here I'm gonna go like over here like in this like pocket by checky I think because you have the A-frame holy poles and it's hilly and it looks kind of checky in dude I could have cooked I mean it was Southern Poland but is this I mean obviously it's the one right but how far west you go in the one here is it like this I might even go even more like it's ever like this or is it ever like down here no no no right no it's surely it's never a random East West I'm going to assume it's like something like this I just moved off to 5K sometimes life is like that and you can't get mad at you have to accept that life is just like that sometimes this is qar right I don't know new coverage like that actually I it could be UAE I actually don't know what Qatar coverage it is like at all okay yeah I don't know I played great I played absolutely great there um just kind of really I mean small countries great great Spain great I kind of just messed my poing guess up there kind of where I went wrong but uh this is something someone definitely could 24K because I just moved off the road there that's okay let's keep it going though 10 second let's keep it going we had no time to waste and good guesses to be made lock in I can't see anything I don't know I I I can like I just don't go Taiwan there I just don't not in you say hey rainbolt I would like to give you 25 guesses to guess what country this is I'd say okay and with L 25 countries and in those 25 countries Taiwan would not have been one of them next round oh dude this is about to be a zero score what am I where what am I looking at France okay surely you go west fine Brazil Southern Brazil Maybe like this maybe more North oh it's just that's okay how's that there this wait is this not this isn't Ghana is this Mexico I can't get to anywhere in time I'm it's gone oh my god wow 10 seconds is brutal 10 seconds is brutal I mean this is just a clear Ghana in my opinion I for for a split second I thought it was Yucatan and that I couldn't get that out of my head for a second and then I was just stuck yeah great seed bad seed that was but this pull is never in Mexico that what I was like what am I doing but I could get to as soon as I started zooming in on Mexico there's no going back there's no going back that's all good though that's all good though I made some kind of good guesses elsewhere maybe not really actually actually I didn't make any good guesses what am I talking about made some good guesses and maybe the game before that but how the hell is this Taiwan nah that's crazy Taiwan all right let's see how everyone else does all all right it's next date let's see how I did round one game one 4 seconds Gorka conas Linley zigzag and then myself let's see 21 people playing this let's see how we did all right well we already know how we did but let's see how the others did round one was Spain where did gor go in Spain gor the type of guy to know that yeah con also got it Goat um Valencia V also the Spain lad getting close um Madrid bid guess also bid guess if you're bad at the game RC I'm just kidding I love you and also based ocean man and uh snail

going on the one here conas getting pretty close Lenley myself top three there and then I think that's D and then zigzag but lots of people on the A1 some people going Western Australia I think there might have looked like a w ball in the distance to be honest but still and then just a Qatar pretty standard seed or like pretty easy seed just kind of region guessing I I would assume but and then the 10 second this was one of my worst games ever I tried going Mexico and Ghana I mean I I knew I knew it was Ghana right Co round one here let's actually select people first I got yeah I got almost at last here that's bad um yeah oh my God look at all the look at all the the round one uh Blinky and Oscar got it couple Philly look how many zero points there are on round one yeah yeah that's crazy

free Ecuador he did nothing wrong you know all right let's see how everyone else does all right let's see how I did let's load it in around game one I got third not too shabby also I know everyone wants different povs unfortunately um it's hard to get people's povs I we'll have like RC Oscar P povs back in like um probably like four or five days I'm sorry okay we got work with what we got right now okay round one was uh Southern us no one went Florida on that yeah I mean all the Georgia guys say are valid because of the outer reflectors but no one did go Florida in that and that does make sense because it does not look like Florida because it's basically just do you consider the pan handle Florida um yeah you know maybe I you know pretty much lived right here for a lot of my life this is not Florida this is Alabama Pensacola is pretty much Alabama is that controversial maybe maybe panon city is like the cut off Destin is probably the cut off but if you live in Pensacola you do you say you live in Florida it's not even in the same time zone as Florida it's in a different time zone it's in the Alabama time it's in central you're not at Florida you could be you can buy a lottery ticket I don't think Alabama can buy a water ticket so maybe that's that's helpful but yeah what's defunk defunc Springs Pleasant Grove that sounds like almost a fortnite I Pi Bethlehem Auburn you even have Auburn Florida you can't have Auburn and not be Alabama you talking about what is this wannabe Alabama what is this that's crazy all right round two enough happy on that one thank you for coming to my TED Talk I hope you guys aren't offended you know I lived outside of no one no one went over here okay yeah good guess is there by RC but I got thir so listen it worked out RC Buzzy Lenley and demitra Blinky where where did I pick up points then where did I pick up points here round three Philly oh yo Linley great great guess by Lenley um I guess no one else saw the tuck or a lot of people a couple people saw the tuck tuck but yeah it did look more Southern I guess that was findable and L did find it the goat shout to Ventura Highway America you may not me America K which makes makes you a little bit worse because you're British but good music so shout out to you guys everyone getting DeMark there me and Blinky up north that picked up a lot of points and then round five what was round five did I pick up a lot of points in oh this yeah I mean not really I'm not really sure how I got third here but consistency wins games free throws defense wins championships I got to work on my defense I guess apparently Lely great AR he must have done well yeah lley mied sh then wait Lenley lowkey popped off because he got round he had 3300 on round one there you go where's Lenley oh he went Tennessee yeah I mean he got second that's kind of crazy GG's and then on the 10 second I got 12th okay Annie are you okay are you okay Annie um RC trior consis round one was Turkey no one went at North a lot of people went Western a lot of people getting turkey round two wait anyone get a really good guess in Turkey here I would say RC tricker totic invaded and consis round two was Bulgaria lots of people getting that no one getting the right mountain range though but everyone going getting that round three was kir is let me zoom in Internet moment consus guys can we start the conversation about cons cheating this is just getting off of hand guys okay let's make this script A Little Less obvious buddy okay let's slash S um round four con you're the goat Ecuador um yeah I feel like that's the reion of eador that few RC and lley where did Lenley mess up because Lenley he didn't mess up he got 23k and got 12 10 that's actually kind of crazy guess it was a pretty easy seed yeah oh wait oh first and second got 24,000 points that's actually crazy and the round five was Greece and r RC popped off what the hell he got 243 my getting four on this one Linley getting five and myself getting four and then on 10 second we have RC getting 16 oh that's a big one tricker getting four and consis getting 13 it's coming down to the wire here can totic pull up and

go like outside Ozark over here yeah I'm kind of it's just joping Missouri um I was kind of near the dropin tornado back in the day fun fact not that fun but devastating pretty pretty devastating okay round let's lock in that was pretty easy H round four oh okay this is Italy right I'm not I'm not being a little silly goose here right guys wait I guess it it looks like weird Croatia though you know or Serbia actually is this ever Serbia wait I just went through like three stages of grief that's crazy it doesn't really look like ity now that actually yeah it does I ity was my first guess and this could be like I'm might tripping on this I'm not sure why I'm I guess I could be C something like down there I don't know la la la la get me out of this game I made such a good Arkansas call out or like those our K and then I just blundered by going C this is why trus in your first guy isn't really always the best thing to do you know sometimes you should have to validate your first guess that was a pretty fun seed that Hong Kong free Lithuania free let's do to free boring seed so basically whoever gets the highest score in round three and round four wins and who will that be I'm not too sure will I cope about it probably not probably we'll find out let's keep going though 10 seconds let's lock in whoa there's no way right buddy you're gonna give me cam Finland who made this map rainbow World come on Rainbow you guys gree wait is this 20 surely gree it's black gen for yeah winter Gen 4 I click here I think surely it's like somewhere over here more westish maybe more eastsh is what I meant I you know cardinal directions are hard sometimes wait this ever this road wrong road you know it's kind of really awkward when you say something really confidently and then you're just wrong and will I C about that in like 10 minutes yeah I will I'll show you guys um oh fun you go Java I guess there C I'm glad I stayed I'm glad I stayed I'm glad my ping is bad shout out to my bad ping 19k pretty bad um all right let's uh let me cope for a second um the road I was thinking about was this Road 76 and tell me this doesn't look not that maybe not where I collect maybe not where I collect there's a road over here that looks where let me pull the lock up again I have to cope where is it where that this is not a good look okay you're telling me this isn't you're tell me you're telling me that's not the same road you're telling me that's not the same road no you're not this is literally the same road fake news actual fake news let's see how everyone else does all right it's next day let's see how we did I got fifth okay that's not too bad gorav Oscar RC 25 people playing let's see what happened round one was Lithuania I think yeah Eastern Lithuania great colge trctor maybe some Eastern Lithuanian Hills you never know round two was well I'm definitely closest there for sure shout out to the Ozarks RC zigzag and uh totic and Missouri but I'll take that and three Hong Kong everyone got that four round four oh yeah I have fit I oh dude I would have done really well if I didn't go CTI on that or Italy on that yeah that's but I have five four four other people with me over there in Italy so it's okay go I'm five was luu and then yeah I actually probably lost a lot of points on L two2 there not really but yeah it was just that c I guess and maybe could have played if it wasn't for that but gor and V also got 23k so potentially not on 10 second I got fourth so close yet so far both of them that's frustrating and our season last because he timed out that's FR that's yeah the Finland turn the AC off the Finland cam is kind of confusing but but con game first Emily gang second maam gang third what was this Greece Mack the closest in Bulgaria based but yeah a lot of people getting gree couple Italy Spain Bulgaria Romania makes sense round three Russia everyone going kind of where that winter is round four was get scor in Cambodia based nipped based this is never not this road like you know it's lots of cod C Brazil but uh yeah just Western Cambodia great guess by Emily this is so winable what happened on round five oh the Cali consis yeah getting West Cali there that's crazy ol over Indonesia there though Gorka getting six V getting two and zigzag getting three 10 seconds we have consus getting 12 quick maths Emily getting six and mackam getting two dude to is so close so his blinking bag is that right I don't know I'm assum I did that right all right con still the lead on 10 second anotic still the lead on the 10 on the 4

another day to use your nogin it's also another day to cope I want you to cope today specifically early on because I was one round away from getting the world record on Thailand and then on round four the round four blunder hit me look at this round one guess since aani and look at this Peach hit guess decent guess and the wonder why this hurts so bad is because I was in the call of Ziggy I'm like Ziggy if this is Chang Ma and I go Peninsula on changai I'm going to be very upset it was changai or Lun but and that freaking house looked so much like changai like I feel like I I'm coping already time we haven't started it but I feel like this house with like this uh maybe someone from Thailand or more experienced or has lived here longer can tell me but I feel like these houses where they have like this overhead car um garage are more common like in changai and for the sake of reducing cope hopefully I've turned on the high score script for at least one game today and we'll see if it works and then go back okay so Ghana I'm going to assume we're going to be somewhere South like down here near the cape Coast um I really like this guys it could be more North like near kamasi on the here I think or it could be even like down here or it could be I'm just said every road so now I can't be wrong but might actually go over here do I want to go east or I'm going to stay West and go with my first instinct we'll see um I guess you just go ba or like outside guess you could go like isario every time I think of Zario I think of the messy quote the little boy from Rosario Argentina on behalf of every little boy wearing his shirt L Messi no no no no o most average Florida neighborhood I guess you just go like outside Orlando or somewhere South yeah I think it's just downtown like Orlando honestly um I guess it could be somewhat more North it looks pretty nice I'm gonna go like I'm just going to hedge like somewh around here on Fort this Romania looks like it' be we have black on the back of the sign there it looks like Romanian concrete and like everything feels Romania I'm GNA go south though next some down here all right and then Brazil or Mex uh Colo wait white Gen 4 yeah should be Colo should be um yeah I like Colo oh this is a Colo fence right here you see the red tip I just go Center and hopefully we get a good score how do I think I did I hope I got the G to guess close and I don't think I missed another country or I don't think I missed a country so my or guess is hopefully it adds up to like a 20K at least oh that was super West a that's frustrating I go back and look at that I was too caught up in the how is that that North how's that Miami it was even more West okay I'm okay with my Gess there good Romania call out and actually I think whoever wins this is whoever goes s Juan here it didn't really look that West to me Miami maybe these are Miami Street signs actually now I'm curious I'm going see if these are Miami specific street signs because that would be nice to know uh let's get to like more urban areas okay that's the same sign someone can let me know where this like white indent stops I wonder what Orlando looks like actually oh Orlando has like a little tree or something on it what is that this is this is probably not all of Orlando though be fair it's like a little palm tree maybe can't really tell what that is but that is different too okay I guess learning these would be kind of helpful if you're playing the US a lot knowing the urban yeah that's just like some rich neighborhood specific they know way that's in all Orlando yeah there's blue probably okay well if you see the street signs go go Miami I guess let's keep it going though let's keep it going 10 seconds it's I'll keep the script on because I think that was kind of fun I've enjoyed myself playing with this script it's kind I can relax a little more okay this looks like it's going to be like downtown like Panhandle but like here in the Brazil side okay here okay we have Mount ridges both sides I'm going to guess isn't there somewhere over here that has rides both sides oh I wanted to go more West uh that's FR ring truly Northeast that's beautiful actually beautiful location un ironically wow what a beautiful sunset oh I have to guess I was too busy admiring the sunset let's go oh this is like lowkey West Poland I don't know I think I might have R Mexico Colo um I didn't um was this a sunset one yeah just Central s poo okay I think that was a chapas car with that blue T I'm going to do another one though because that was kind of boring I don't want two both seeds to be boring so I'm going do one more this looks fun off the bat what is this Bulgaria Sakia Romania Slovenia I just syia I think it's soak or something though damn that was a beautiful location too do you see that River oh my God the Earth is sick dude like the fact that we get to breath the same oxygen in Slovenia is kind of crazy y this is a crazy Ireland right or ni Water West what the [ __ ] do you get is this Scotland there's no way that's Scotland right what do you do here do you go Philly or indo or yeah you go Java or Philly I'm going to go LZ on I think that could be Java though maybe we'll see just be up here I think Northeast Romania um all right let's see 20K wait that was France okay great Philly call out Finland Romania was more West this is Austria oh that was Jersey ah that makes so much more sense that makes a lot of sense for Gen 2 with Wild West makes a lot of sense jerse is one of those places I don't really think about because it's not really that common okay let me look at this Austria um I like my I think my SL oh my god dude look how nice this water looks oh my God it [ __ ] looks like blue Gatorade how is that not died now that's like some blue ass water holy holy [ __ ] it's just like oh I want to drink that all right a fun day all around um yeah I'll send the second one because that one was more fun to my friends and let's see how everyone else does oh [ __ ] oh I hope that's what I think this is wait the house looks so wrong wait low key not bad gas there's no way bring over there and I was like bro that looks like Portuguese I something like r that wores and then I'm like I look here I'm like oh [ __ ] you actually probably got more points than some people going like Scotland or Northern Ireland so oh my God ni dude you're first bro I mean see you can hold it probably not prob not yeah wonder if some people get Jersey maybe it's hard to commit Jersey I don't know it's just like here somewhere slowy this Lake no okay it's there it feels kind of kind of more like out there like Mendoza or St Louis or San Juan I'm going to go like here okay yeah it was okay this is a Miami Street sign so Southwest 94th would be I'll go there okay yeah I thought it was like West like here I hope I'm not wrong here no it is just there yeah I feel like it's north and I would say like maybe this road or something it's possible okay that side your only bad guess is Romania that's crazy I'm going to say like Alps or something I don't know okay Austria I should have gotone Austria to be honest bro why is the line oh wait it's Finland I'm throwing actually it's like down here never in doubt this this lowkey like here oh it's Jersey okay actually I I'm I'm happy with that guess corn bro why we got corn really don't is it Philly I don't know if it was Philly or yeah okay it was I clicked there but it didn't switch and then another Romania which I don't know going just say like here you get first nice what the [ __ ] dude bro I I haven't even like played in like a week like barely played like daily challenge was my only only games I played basically this guy bro this guy all right it's next day and oh Ziggy beat RC last second and Harrier and I got 11th of 21 let's see where everyone went round one was just Ghana lots of people getting that everyone getting that from this part region no one getting exactly yeah maybe this I guess more people got some more Western Vibes and I did from that but great guess by Toro playing from an airport presumes that's actually a fine why I guess I like uh yeah who knows there street signs couple people do couple people going north and a couple in Los Angeles around four Romania a lot of people going Western flat Romania that makes sense and they r five just Colo and then the 10 second RC cons Blinky dude it's always the same 21 people playing this let's see what happened round one Austria oh some Japan I didn't even think about that but I could see how that looks like Japan now or like low cam potentially but SV Austria if you went Europe is where you went round two Finland round three what was round three every oh the Jersey round ah dude Ziggy the only one to get Jersey but he got 11 points round one so do poor guy blink still getting top three with only going with guessing in the water is kind of crazy round four was Philly just L on flat do people go Java yeah I like the Java guess there too in they round five was another Romania I could have made some better region guesses today I really could have I don't like a couple my guesses but that's okay all right Ziggy getting four RC getting three there two and Harrier getting three and then for the 10 second RC getting 10 consus where's cons this a nine and Blinky 15 oh this is getting close this is getting really close I did not mean to do that all right I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 9.53536128699567, "lng":

cope because I will not cope because I'm a goat and I'm make the right exact guess within meters every single guess okay oh my R light just fell over this is weird this is like a weird Argentina right like uh dude I want to go to Argentina bro this place is beautiful I'm going assume it's somewhere down here somewhere wait maybe even more North like this maybe North South Road something like this makes sense to me little more North but that's okay we'll take it okay this the type of that Blinky sits there in 5K is like a nerd bro like it's so cringe you guys want see me try and find 5K oh my God should I try and do it guys no I should shouldn't I okay so there's round about God damn [Laughter] it I just saw round about and got happy okay that's funny oh my God okay Japan I just have to click Tokyo here I think oh my God yeah oh this is fun Endo right oh this is a fun Endo round four or five okay I'm not going to choke lock in is it ever fly or anything else I think it's just Indo and is it ever like is it samatra or do you go like Sula wait is Philly with his gutter no oh my AC's on bad White Noise Okay um that that gutter feels more Philly but I'm gonna stick to some Matra here I think but these trees look weird for I'm gonna go Sula okay yesterday I was like this is never this is literally just here and I know yesterday I was like oh it's never Mainland this is actually just here God damn it dude the Colossal just I mean that's just tragic it's just absolutely tragic it's just you hate to see a moment maybe I should use a script it's okay reduce the code does not work 10 seconds on the clock invite friends start game this is my game to have a good game good game this looks like one of these roads up here but it's going east west so I go this road close enough lock in um why and yellow Chevron wait where the is that besides turkey and this is not turkey how is that turkey don't know my polls I'm going Java oh man I I that's not North ma pole Poland go Poland right Spain is it really an island oh I don't not have time to commit to an island oh just North Spain oh my God all right it's next day how do we do Emily got first conest de I got 10th could have been worse with that blunder 19 people finishing today that's let's see what went wrong round one was Argentina blink uh Jami contis and de getting very very close there assumingly knowing that mountain everyone else going kind of that same region of Argentina around the Border somewhere there round two okay did anyone go in the same intersection as me base Toro Emily Axel zigzag snil and Harrier absolutely base the people that actually 5K don't need any credit and based contest just not even finding a roundabout that's base okay round three was Japan yeah you click Tokyo you select Urban AF um oh no one got somatra wait people went Philippines wait what was wait I was two seconds away from being the only person to go samatra that's yeah I cope okay to be fair this gutter is so like Filipino like I don't know maybe that doesn't really make sense but I feel like that's that looks super Philly wait is this even yeah it is no one going sasra there though is crazy closest is in Java wait no like no one even went Indonesia only like five people went Indonesia that's what Emily got first wow that's actually crazy and then yeah Borneo based axle or based V mackam everyone guess here gu's all scattered all right that was kind of insane and then the 10se second I got this a day of 10 guess you can call it a dime the way it be only 17 people oh my God people do not like these seeds Okay round one was Kenya some people on the right road to Turkey lots of people getting turkey there couple all over Europe yeah no one going north Matra like what the is that pole like snail is the goat though as usual great great guess there Snelly well round four was Poland everyone getting round five was Spain yeah in hindsight my guess is South doesn't really make sense but I was like oh I just have to click somewhere with water South in Spain very last second and Gorka getting the right Road average Spain main Emily getting three points consis getting 10 and De getting two and then for the 10 seconds we have totic oh my wait oh dude cons just or uh bag just blew like a 3-1 lead bro straight up s five damn okay so it's first of 20 wins and just took

we're back with another day of some daily G today is a good day have a good day oh my God I just got back from the dentist bro I've had like two canals I have to get this week has been rough and I can I'm talking and I can't feel half my leg my upper face and it this tuck tuck would make me think it's Philippines and like L on that is not the Philippines that is Japan but it's like super flat so do you go like Sly over here I think I'm cooking low key wait how hard am I cooking right now I hope I'm cooking oh I forgot I had that script on I thought I turned it off I really wish I knew I don't like that I didn't want to play today with that on I just really didn't that looks like is that's the Spanish sign right this house doesn't really look Spanish is it just like something like this I go like over here can't read what the two letters are because those two letters will tell you what province or state you're in we'll try it all listen I don't know I don't know what I'm cooking up here huh a red fire hydrant makes me think the us but like what the hell is this because it doesn't really look us but the fire hydrant feels like that looks like an American fire hydrant now but like the trees don't feel us at all everything else feels European oh man I'm about to get like a 2K score and I won't even know I I don't know where to go here guys like at all like this is just Europe I think but like I don't even know where in Europe I'd go like what what where am I clicking here this is a disaster this is actually a disaster I guess you go like over here somewhere in like SLP right it looks like it could be like down here but there's a mountain East which doesn't really make sense I'm just going go like this I'm about to get this might be one of my worst games ever okay I can cook this I think I'm going to go like down like here somewhere like Max South like is there coverage down here like okay I'm not kidding I think I'm just saying I might have just gotten like an 8,000 score and I'm not even being sarcastic wow okay I cooked Northern Spain that was what okay Pennsylvania is not a bad guess there Monteray is crazy for that in my opinion and how is it not South Nigeria okay and I did call out the L on tuck tuck so that's good I mean I didn't know where to guess here but like Pennsylvania doesn't really make sense but like honestly neither does [ __ ] Mass massachusett Massachusetts Massa [ __ ] Mass Boston having State Massachusetts matcha mass m toown i mean it's just a fire hydrant is the only reason I went there honestly I don't know it's like something you'd see like a dog piss on you know like a movie so it's like kind of worked out I'm turning the script off it is off I just forgot to refresh I think playing without that would be more fun for the 10c because my heart just can't take it like I don't like having the anticipation like that all right 10 seconds My Heart Will Go On Seline Dion looks like just like something over here sure uh how far east do you go like something like more East I think like East London wait is this 10 seconds that was way too much time I'm just a goat I cooked I meant to go in the 30 SE I why is a 10 second taking so long I just [ __ ] guessed in like the [ __ ] Amazon because I thought I didn't have enough time and then I sit there for 30 for 14 seconds is is the clock resetting or something am I lagging or is this actually 10 seconds am I coping I knew the road there too that's so is this franer the US I just went France on the US I cooked wait crazy shout it's located just downtown here and it's never Mainland Malaysia guys I can't believe like this 10 seconds for like 30 seconds I had my guest down and I had like four seconds like I could have gotten into the road there let's see let's see how everyone else does is that a Tuk Tok yeah I think it is actually I was like what the hell is this wait hold on I have to try hard on the T [ __ ] it didn't really help okay um I'm going to say I kind of want to go like no that doesn't make sense I don't know uh it's like a Spanish what is this like who has red I actually don't know is it like Navar maybe I don't know I'll try Navar bro this is like bald eagle State Forest or something no I think the trees are too low um this could actually be like Arkansas I kind of want to try it why not is there any locks like this in aransa I don't remember what else could it be askcar let's try Arkansas like I kind of got talipa SI but then I kind of also didn't maybe like a southern tus I don't know we'll just go here uh wait 20 oh it's Nigeria I wonder if I thought for a second if it was a Panama yeah I think it's just like this area like Calabar somewhere kind of dude it was uh it wasn't Baldi what wait that's okay that's kind of crazy how' you where' you play this probably got top 10 though oh no 20 wait how did you get that wait how's is everyone mind like what happened wait how the L to someone it's you know the you know the meme where it's like the guy doing the racing game and then he's like oh that's like top three easy and then it's like 16th you know that no but I'll find it easy top three if I'm not 16th with me that that us round is Southern it is just Southern but did no one go Europe on that because like that's not easy us I did I I did RC I should have got bald eagles save Forest that's where I went wait look at my guess yeah you pretty much clicked it it's like I guess I just inally clicked middle on accident I that's actually insane all right it's next day and Binky got first with 235 consis and Gorka and snail dude snail is actually in his bag zigy how do we do we got 13th on this one not too shabby and RC dropped to 23rd that's actually insanely tragic but see how everyone did and figure out what happened round one was Philly lots of close guesses there in Lon presumably probably because of the tuck tuck round two was wow saado and Buzzy getting the right Road um I guess if you know the colors but yeah Blinky and cont m close great guesses most people getting Spain everyone getting Spain that's good round three oh this was the the doozy couple people getting Mass any bald e State Forest enjoyers no not quite but uh people going Northeast lots of lots in Europe yep that's a pretty hard round in my opinion round four was Mexico I I guess that's just a St skill Sho on my part I don't know what I missed there and then round five was just bunch of Southeast enjoyers there so not too shabby and the 10 second Blinky RC is zigzag 29 people playing this one so we did we got 17th where did they I forgot what I messed up on this one where was it we'll see Thailand everyone getting obviously round two Z people getting the coast East Coast like I look like a [ __ ] idiot over here bro oh my God it's most free 30C ever France I got France where did I mess up round five no one want no one went Borneo he was flat AF but like not a single person Blinky getting six consus getting eight and Gorka getting one and then the 10 second we have Blinky again oh my God wait did Blinky get yeah Blinky just got first both okay bro 14 RC getting seven and Oscar getting five not too shabby bag still there but only by one point now it's getting coose con Blinky Nick and neck and I will see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 25.341635929177993, "lng":

another day some G guys it's also another day to use your Noggin hopefully everyone's locked in and ready to guess I am why am I so today because I turned off coping why did it turn off or how did I turn off coping well I turn on the script that allows me so I won't see location where the location is until after the game is over so I won't know how good I did until after the game is over so if I click this and I click Columbia which I think is South somewhere down here actually I think it's going be more North I don't like that guess but I can't cope about it I just coped I didn't know if it was right or wrong but we won't know if that's right until after the seed is over because it I hid the results just go like over here I think yeah it should be fine um what was this Germany is my first instinct no wait this is front car so then you go can us or Canada on this what the [ __ ] wait this looks so non-american I don't know where to go here at all I go south there like Northern Pines though where did I just guess I don't know where I just guessed where the [ __ ] was that is that even in Europe I don't know I'm assuming I'm right so we can move on is this South Africa or Brazil I think you have to go Brazil here yeah you have to go Brazil here somewhere like this maybe wait where did I go M I don't know where you go here I'm going to go like something like this oh Lord I could have like a 4,000 score right now I have no idea like that was round four hopefully I didn't round four blunder and here you P we go right it's not nmi or anything like that right it's PR it's not am I tripping it's not inite right they're go should be should be it should be right okay I don't know what score it's got it could be a 5,000 or it could be a 25,000 I honestly don't I'm gonna expect I think I think I messed up like the Brazil that was a really hard location that could be wrong country and then there's a couple like that I don't know and that also could have been inmi I actually don't know so let's see how I did 18,000 that's actually not bad that was super South I don't know if I would have got that I'm okay with this guess in in Ontario it just looked weird to me I'll take the Ontario guess and I've round four blundered still without even knowing that's super Sou I just didn't know where to go there but that makes sense and then I wanted to go north here but like not sure why I did right was whatever maybe this doesn't reduce coping maybe it just Aggregates coping into one like burst of cope because now you get I get all the copes at the same time but yeah this is a pretty easy actually I can see someone going Europe on that and I can see someone not going Brazil on that so I could get like top five still I think with that all right 10 seconds on the clock hopefully hopefully this can reduce the round for blunder in the 10 second at least V don't know where that is is it ever Baja [ __ ] I hope that was Baja did I just go Germany on us is this South Africa no the [ __ ] is this bro what I'm going to have a 4k on this score like unironically this this is a 4K I might go in I here I'm going in I here this might be the worst score ever I'm not going to lie like this is going to be one of the worst sces I think I've ever had I'm assuming I got like8 8K on that one like I don't know if that Romania one I guessed on was even Europe or if that was South Africa I don't know if half my gues were good wait I kind of popped off it was Luxembourg okay I was confused on that one because that was Bulgaria okay yeah I think not to cope I think you can see me slightly hedging down to Bulgaria on that one I'm just going to say that out loud but I can see there's a yellow plate that's why I went to that's why I went West Germany near Netherlands because I was like I guess see this yellow plate I was like wait but this one didn't have one so I was like wait is this Germany or is this Netherlands or what is this it's just literally that one car though and there's a couple back there that don't have yell plates either I I unironically maybe would have started coping on the Bulgaria really badly and the Luxembourg so maybe that's for the best this one is crazy I'm almost put South Africa on this this really looks South African mainly because of the I don't know this looks so not Bulgarian maybe the I don't know I could I could maybe go I mean I almost went Bulgaria on this but this car I guess that was fun that was a fun seed though and I think it actually might have helped or maybe it didn't or maybe it's Placebo or maybe it's both but let's see I every else does now my ant apartment in Romania in Bucharest yeah okay well hopefully actually you're look at you're closer to the Jus server so your game will load faster actually true uh this is like here somewhere I think I will just assume I did good oh God what is this this is like Belgium or something wait are we driving left no okay good yeah Belgium is fine I don't know um Bulgaria I don't know oh try Bulgaria probably Ireland I think it's either Ireland or Northern Ireland so we chill in on it anyways uh should just be a actually no I think it's Slovenia before you click next after this let me know how you think you did um what place do you think you got let's just try and do get your place wait okay okay I need to think wait what was the first round it was the oh it was the Mexico I think I did go on the Mexico and then hopefully I did decent on like I don't even know if that was Belgium I just kind of randomly got and then Bulgaria I don't know if that was right I could like if I if I actually got the countries on this then I could see a top three but if I didn't then I [ __ ] I don't know okay I think I got the country on this okay for you did good Mexico is yeah okay closer on to be honest actually that makes sense and this one was bulgar okay pretty good yeah yeah that's scary I don't know the script is scary it's fun it's fun when they're like toss up continents and you just have to wait to see if you have a four 4K or 24K yeah okay I'm going be honest I did not see this on my laptop the yellow plate I just saw this one and I was like that's not a yellow plate I don't know and I was like confused about the guard rail that's interesting guard rail ending yeah it looks it looks like the US Gil low key yeah all right GG's all right happy Friday to those that celebrate and shout out to Blinky zigzag and debre for bringing home the first second third let's see how I did I got seventh place 20 people finishing the seed that is okay let's see how everyone did round one was Colo everyone getting Colo that's good congrats to gu my contest and Oscar there getting that this whoa yeah this was tough actually this was an insane round the only reason I got it right was because you can see the front of the car and you can you can't see the front of the car in Europe so I didn't know where else to go so that's I'm fine with that guess honestly round four who else got that actually Blinky great guess Oscar me de yeah Snail out there Minnesota Minnesota was this yeah okay this I don't blame the wrong content guessers on this one at all like I don't know did anyone go South Africa okay thank you my uh yeah I didn't know where to go in Brazil though either because I I I just didn't know look Our Guest there by these fellow Lads and round five was Paro what the [ __ ] gor Blinky and deor getting on the right Road or like the 5K and then 10 second bag de and I guess de is just in his bag today I got 10th place in this one okay 25 people finishing this one so maybe we have a little Jos or quitters that's okay round one Baja oh my God you know what I miss more than anything about the US I get the Baja Blast like they have Taco Bell here it's fine but you don't get Baja Blast oh man Gorka blinkie bag and Har in the right Road there and Emily just slightly up but great gu is all around everyone getting Mexico for the most part or for the all part okay this one was Lux only couple people de trior Jami Gorka and Har got Lux lots of people going Germany Belgium France makes so much sense in Netherlands but yep does make sense round three was Bulgaria this was a tough Bulgaria three other people in Romania with me a couple um all over scatter through Europe I have to sneeze I'm gonna hold it in on four oh my God it's Friday I can't I'm so glad it's Friday my night Market's open ah it's gonna be a good day all right um bunch of Ni guessers here couple Ireland um yeah and then round five was just Slovenia and I went Southern Austria but lots people Slovenia Austria kind of 5050 all right Blinky getting three zigzag getting two and debre getting damn how is Mony zigzag or de don't have any points on here it's kind of crazy and then on 10 second bag is up to 15 oh Deb is at eight and Emily it that's four bag taking the lead here with authority can he keep it find out tomorrow and I will see you

right it's another day to use your Noggin hopefully today is a good day on some map game but if it's not that's okay and this we can maybe 5K this I thought that road right there is covered where am I going where am I where am I where did I zoom in on birth I was in Kazakhstan for a second uh yeah I know there's Mountains east though maybe right here somewhere along this road was that oh that was like right next to that road wasn't on the map though in the intersection but that was kind of like right next to where I was I think that's fine wait can we ly get a crack score wait dude I I can't work the map today I couldn't find GH on a map what happened into my brain okay surely we we don't go to the n10 right do we go to the n10 here or do we go the N2 or do we go on this road north but it's north to south so that would not make sense as much so we might go in the n12 here but I think it could be the n10 near tamale I might go the n10 near tamale it was the n 10 near tamale I should have gone closer South though is this is this one of the Slovenian signs or what is this Croatia I'm not very good at Urban Europe to be honest oh no it's Che Sakia isn't isn't this red house number sakian or something or check in dude why am I just having trouble playing right now um I think it's czechy Slovakia and his winter coverage so I Lan cheia and that's a good guess okay everyone with me now voses dawon okay so the immediate thought here is Canada or Russia and you're like no this is just never Canada then you're go okay where in Russia there's trash in the road which makes you think more likely Europe um so that means do you go Baltic or go Russia I think I might go Baltic here this would be a crazy Baltic because it's like a very wide unpaved road that doesn't really look Baltic but I don't really want to commit Russia why because if it is Baltic it's free points if it's Russia it's not free points quick maths and if it's New Brunswick I'm sorry but laia is my best guess here it was Russia [ __ ] and just CLI cono here okay that is a cracked seed wait a second that's such a cracked seed wait if someone makes one good rush I guess it's 24K aable that's a 24K seed for sure because you have three free 4900s honestly um yeah all right 10 seconds hopefully we can keep the same Pace as the last game that's pretty good if I just clicked Moscow it would have been a little bit better I L you want to get used to the andies here but I'm not going to because I'm a coward I'm gonna go somewhere over here I'm a coward I'm just a coward that's all I am that's all I ever will be and here you have to go NSA you can go Sula actually I'm going Sula going south Sula okay good switch um I'm just to coward that's all what the [ __ ] is this turkey is this turkey this is like turkey pavement I feel like oh [ __ ] I have to click oh that was a good guess let's not choke it here um okay so you should go near like I think token his Minas area here maybe a little B over near closer to masas though it was Minas okay ah the hills I should Peru is it ever Chile is ever Bolivia I think I Go Peru here though like Southern Peru I hedge bivia Chile Lima why do I try and do cool things okay so if I click Lima and I collected my instinct on east of Andes I would have had a great day and if I click Moscow bunch of ifs not copes they're just ifs and that's okay um but I think that's a solid day all around not too shabby let's see how everyone else does all right it's like maybe like an hour later since I recorded that video and I went back to go check the comments of my most recent video and someone left a comment saying I wish that someone would make a script that doesn't show your final score until the seed is over and so I messaged Miracle webs which is like a known developer in the community that builds scripts for people and he made me a script in like 45 minutes that won't show me the my round individual score until the seed is over so I won't get in my head anymore if you guys want me to use it I can try it I have it oh I I'm just like these are all the scripts I have installed by the way if you guys want to if you guys think I'm cheating wa it's the G height score script it's on his website Miracle web.dev which has like all of the any any script you could want in the game all right I'm going to try a 10-second seed with it and I'm going to see how it does um okay Philippines I'm gonna go SIU here actually no I'm g go north like near Manila okay it's hidden I'm assuming I can press space bar go okay oh D this is great okay okay lock in surely this is Germany right I hope it's Germany I hope it's Germany I hope it's Germany man okay is this Colo or no this is like Seria or something I hope it's Seria or something oh man I can't okay lock in lock in okay just Japan so I'm unsure of like two of them so far and they're round five oh what the hell is this France okay lock it I could have a really good score right now I don't even know that's the crazy thing about it Go France all right I got 19k wait I popped off oh that was the UK at the end okay I can't my dude that that's an I almost got the right Road there what the hell okay I'm going to do one more one more cuz that was fun okay round one what the heck is this Denmark laia oh red car Sweden surely right we'll see oh no this is this is okay lock in lock in lock in I just have to assume I got right this Bangladesh what is thiso I'm try and get the I think it's somewhere over here okay this could be this could be an insane score guys I hope [Music] [ __ ] it was Sweden not Norway looky region get Ireland that's kind of crazy I mean maybe I played better I don't know I'm gonna do one more because this is fun I'm kind of addicted why he click in the mountains that's cringe I'm kind of popping off though I think I'm popping off wait I think I'm really popping off wait I think I'm actually popping off whoa wait czechia maybe Germany don't know something [ __ ] I

right it's another day of some G guys here it's also another day to use your Noggin hopefully everyone's locked in and ready to guess I am why am I so ready today because I don't have a phone why do I not have a phone because I missed my pocket and it fell six feet little bit of flex there my waist is not six feet but let's just say six feet into the concrete therefore is shattered therefore now it's at Apple getting fixed by Apple Care and they said Oh come back and 2 hours so what am I supposed to [ __ ] do now without a phone for two hours the walk back to the [ __ ] my my my condo boring I can't [ __ ] watch Tik toks in the elevator bro this [ __ ] I'm not built for this life bro I'm just straight up not I'm just not and that's okay you know I accept I accept that I accept it okay now that rant's over I can focus and I guess I'll just record the daily challenge and hopefully it takes me two hours to finish a seed that's why I'm taking my time here here do we go Poland here or do we go Poland I to go Poland you could go maybe you could see a weird France or Netherlands but I think you go Poland here right right guys okay which is north Poland okay this is a fun one I think you go new Bruns Nova Scotia on right I'm not sure where else you you don't go west or like Manny or Ontario I don't think on this you could if you're bad you you could go there if you're [ __ ] horrible at this game you could easily go there watch it watch it be Ontario now that'd be really ironic or Quebec no I think I like this call out actually I don't now I'm like in my head what if it is Ontario Quebec okay we're good okay let's not choke this oh this is a fun lock I think it's Georgia right isn't the Georgia thing with the reflectors around the outside than is Georgia right so I'm I'm going to assume that's right and go Georgia like somewhere over here by South Carolina uh you know it looked like Florida but I guess I trust the meta more than um okay that was I didn't that was just a I didn't mean to cope on that that was just a kind of a where the [ __ ] is this wait where is this bro is this Canada or is this u i mean obviously I know it's North America or like us or Canada but I don't know this pole feels like something that Pole right there looks like something you get like here but like that's not that pole and now I'm [ __ ] confused bro because these trees are weird as fudge because this could be West too bro I don't know where to go okay why was that so weird why does this look not like where I click or like Ontario to me at all I lowkey kind of popped off my candidate today I mean that's pretty good I blundered that Florida one though because I thought RC told me that when you have the reflectors on the outside that's Georgia but I guess it's technically not on the outside maybe maybe it's on when they're on the inside wait no you know what he might have said actually is maybe he said that was a southern thing I think that's what he said actually so yeah I blundered a probably a free Georgia or a free Florida here that's okay all right let's do 10 seconds now hopefully this goes by super slow because what the heck am I supposed to do for the next three hours or two hours I'm going to do load up Tik Tok on my [ __ ] desktop maybe I go play fortnite game or something I don't know man another hour to kill maybe I'll I don't know oh that's a cool little dock sitting on the do by river watching the time how is it not Cambodia tell me that doesn't look like Southwest Cambodia I guess maybe not that looked like I thought I Loki had the 5K down there I'm not going to KY on you Ian that's says South palana but we're not trusting that right guys [ __ ] dude this is why you don't read like it's actually the most cringe thing ever this is lowkey like free Island over here somewhere that Island okay or that coast and then PR the dock by the river okay I'm going to go cope on this one like okay tell this doesn't look like there's like Hills down here too that I thought those were the hills okay well this isn't help my case okay listen let me find something that dude [ __ ] came ruin Cambodia dude Geer or street view like why would you release coverage that's worse oh man this is really not maybe maybe I should just get better at the game oh my God [ __ ] cam wait that looks so different what the [ __ ] they paid like all these roads now dude honestly okay this is just piss okay I thought we were looking at these Hills you know dude actually [ __ ] cam is actually making me tilted also dude Cambodia has been super developed in the past 10 years like look at this like dude panon pin too has changed so much they have like skyscrapers now bro but look at this I guarantee you this is like nothing yeah wait that's actually crazy this is like wow I mean want to go here actually odds this wasn't even covered okay I got to focus I I'm cooking so hard right now but you guys can see where I'm coming from also this house right here was on stilts okay so it's only right of me to go Cambodia if you see house on stilt all right I just yapped way too hard mainly because I wanted to fill some time because I don't know what to do but let's see how every else does shall we the road's kind of almost redish but I think it's just morning time I'm cutting that for the video don't worry no Red Road propaganda here this is we get that okay that's fine isn't this just like every polish round ever I'm just going to go like this probably thought you brunwick there's no Transformers that I saw it's very Sandy which I find a bit strange maybe it's just Ontario but no I think I think I just go near brunwick here yeah po looks Florida but it definitely feels like North Florida if it's Florida to me like maybe like could be out here but I guess like I'd probably just hedge Tallahassee or something okay is a black car it might be black car sometimes the back of the car lies a bit but I was kind of thinking around here maybe like penbroke area maybe like North Bay I'm going try this okay no I mean Jamar had even North Bay wouldn't have been good enough of course all right next day let's see how we did got eighth place con Jami and Ziggy conest getting first place okay we back let's see how everyone did in round one which was Germany and everyone pretty much got Germany because it ballards pretty standard round two Poland couple France Belgium guesses check get makes sense Sweden usually Forest this was New Brunswick lots of New Brunswick guers here shout to the main K back Ontario round four Florida yeah shout out to my Georgia represent ation over here you know and then round five was Ontario with those poles or the lamps I think and then on the 10 second I got fourth place with going Cambodia on endo and only 18 people finished this one so guess some people weren't very happy with their scores scores there all right round one was Stockholm lots of ston guessers fair enough with the IR lines dude Buzzy and V based bunch of Borneo guers here or a couple zigzag Amman bag my Blinky and Deb but a lot of people getting close in Philly as well and Indo have a ea Brazil lots of Sal Pao clickers for obvious reasons around four Bas RC guess Bas RC guess yep makes sense looks like that region over there and around was PR consus getting three Jami getting two and Ziggy getting one and

going I get the head stone walls right wait is it let yeah I think it is okay well you certain need to move your house you freaking I'm sure he's from Connecticut he just like moved across the borders and he has tradition you know okay round three oh Lord I mean it's Russia obviously guys I thought it was East immediately but like now I'm like dude it's West and Russia so frame my head after you know the incident a couple days ago I think I might just click outside MOS no this looks so Eastern bro it looks like it's literally over here again I can't I can't do it though I can't do it that's so West oh my God it's next to gravy sh to young gravy all right and what looks seems to be a Peru one would think it's round four we kind of already choked round three that's okay because we still kind of picked up big points and uh you know every time I get Peru I'm like is this ever one of those like random places in Bolivia that I just have never seen it's just it's just a thought you know I don't think it is though I I don't think it is that'd be crazy it is though it was just North okay I'm bad round three round five uh surely it's just downtown [Music] like oh dude it's should just clicked two it bro where did I click bro where did is like where where am I clicking here not sure why I did that to be honest but okay that wasn't fun that was an interesting day all around I didn't really play that good to be honest but uh I also didn't really play that bad either you know kind of average day I think all around oh rainbow world 10 seconds on the clock actually let's check to see if back has been dethroned he has orbis do not know who that is can someone vouch 10 seconds on the clock let's do this let's use our Noggin Kev always wins round two okay this looks like Central like this right here it was East I suck ACA surely okay for for we're not going to choke it don't worry guys I'm going to go the I'm not GNA go the I'm gonna go see that always works round five uh France I guess France uh France France I did good on that seed but that was the most that was like I don't that's like click middle click Kev click Capital click SIU and click Center we're playing another one I I can't send my friends to see that's 23k by clicking capital on middle okay round one with the Indonesia somewhere like samatra sou sure uh okay Vos datin uh France so so Frick dude when in doubt click [ __ ] you Italy I didn't mean that ity I'm sure you're great people great country um where in the hell in Russia is this I'm going west um hello 2020 Vision uh pick up the phone wait we we driving left wait this isn't [ __ ] I don't know where to go here wait is this Ukraine or Russia [ __ ] I don't know ah get a guess off D that's that's why it looks so weird I mean that's I guess Southern Russia heding it dude well that was a fun seat though yeah you had to use your Nog on that one uh how was this where was this Italy how is this Bari though like I would at least go like North or like I would never go Barry on this bro what all right that was a good day that was a fun day all around but uh yeah let's see how everyone else does is it uru or like south Brazil I I'll stay in south Brazil how about that that was okay wow this is some epic rock walls right here yeah I think this is just like Massachusetts maybe I don't know I would say just just a general over here somewhere we have like these flowers which are common in like Ciro for example uh I don't think the antenna would fit for Leningrad part I mean it could could be but wasn't my first thought pus oh pusco is possible actually do I want to go pusco maybe no no no I'm going to stick in cure of here uh we'll just see no it was piskov bro oh my God this guy I mean it's Peru right yeah it's got to be Peru I mean it's not Bolivia right I don't recognize it though I mean maybe it's like Cusco or something yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna try Cusco here no it was North it was okay somewhere pretty Central I would say just over here somewhere okay okay I'm gonna say it's like simatra maybe oh bellatone that's interesting is this ever Sardinia like here no it's just ity oh man I overthought it I a southern corellia actually could be more Northern no okay it's LR what wait what it looks like Italian sign but I'm so confused where is this oh my God it's South Africa dude that okay and then there just just uh donet I think probably the round four blunder got you bro bro the round four blunder damn yeah I mean not the first time I've went to Europe on South Africa in one of these let me Cope Let Me cope okay um we just go on the area that I clicked in Sardinia low looks like it dude this guy all every single time he has to okay but in uh let me find the Gen 2 Road around here okay uh hold on hold on no no let me like actually cook cook this up okay I guess it's not really that similar I I could see I could see how yeah it's just like this flat area like gen two flat Europe yeah definitely bro uhhuh yeah yeah I mean gen two flat Europe just like nowhere else I guess I should just remember that this area look like Seria that that was my cope of the day it's like that's a cool grid click it yeah that looks like the US yeah low key looks like the USU that's a good bait wait wait can you get get I mean dude it's always poles do remove poles H dude that could be wait if far enough away yeah that's that's Iowa that's Iowa I think it's Ohio but well we're both getting 800 points so it's okay yeah all right it's next day we got eighth place on the 42nd ex consus consus is the king of third place right now let get probably the most placement out of anyone but it's almost like third or second I think all right let's see we have 22 people playing today wow what happened here all right round one the Uruguay a lot of people in Uruguay a couple people in Argentina kind of all over the place RC fancy within Southern Brazil round two was uh couple Red Island guessers here I thought it was connected with the stone walls but maybe it wasn't maybe it was mass I don't know well I mean obviously it's everywhere but more common shout out to consis and snail for getting Rhode Island dude RC could have really popped off here if he switched but um yeah a lot people going Western Russia and round four was Peru I thought that was Bolivia I do not blame that guess I do not know how you go that North but wolf trer amazing guess and round five Sagal and we have some devs in South Africa keep your head up yeah like I said I don't know what I was guessing here but click tuba as always and on the 10 second still no placement for your boy but 25 people finishing this one this was an insane seed we have like a couple people under 10,000 which is like valid extremely valid for this one round one was yeah no one's getting that lot of monra guessers based zigzag water hedger end up being closest there I think round two was Bari yeah that's a great guess lots of people in France Spain Sardinia Greece yeah it's great guys by them looking at it again I do get more those vibes okay yeah all over Russia here G by Axel and tror yep a lot people going Western Russia round four oh the zah yeah this one was tough because the only reason people got zah here was because it was driving left and it doesn't look like Australian Southern hemispher is but wow totic great guess I mean totic won by 3,000 points that's quite uh quite good yeah so we have some aor madira Portugal Italy Japan all over the world yeah in round five was D RC zigzag Jers and Ziggy getting that zigzag getting 12 Ziggy getting six and consis getting 16 slow and steady wins a race I guess still in first and then for the 10 second totic he's getting his first three Eddie is getting two and Gorka is getting one

yes I will fix it round one you have to with cash in Thailand or I do at least and I forgot to go pay I will do that after this okay don't make fun of me this looks this looks lowy kind of tropical do I go on island here ever dude I might just go on Island that would be crazy though I do it this just going to be like downtown Tokyo and just lost a lot of points but listen you have to risk it for the biscuit sometimes T just not and it's just making fun me because my internet's bad this is just such a bad this is just ba surely I just need to start guessing it if I just guess two seconds I just click Tokyo and I have a great score right now you know like what I it's very embarrassing that I did not pay maret please do not mention it round three I mean this is just newa right it looked like I thought it was Loa for a second obviously it's just somewhere over here might even go like this like easta or like tour I'm g go easta I'm I'm gonna dude I'm listen I have to commit I already am committing you know zba okay I should got that round three is this what I think it is wait this is crazy if that's what I think it is there's no way that's what I think it is right it has to be that that's just the the Dominican Republic car right where do you get a white Road like this in Dominican Republic though this city up here and I can't even load the map I guess so wait is it kersell no no no obviously not load it was just D wrong City okay crazy this one is I can't believe I did the I should just click Tokyo why did I think it was an island why it look this like somewhere over here surely like yeah like Southern baj is my best [Music] guess fumbled the Dr fumbled that's an easy Zumba I think should just click Tokyo everything else a great guess let's play a rainbow world seconds on the clock a rainbow world let's do this hopefully my game can load in 10 seconds should be able to it looks like it's like some on one of these roads actually I'm going to go more North yeah whatever ah sure come on we got this okay let a Bulgarian pull Sophia wait this is a US wow I'll tell you what I saw after that I got lock in us again that looked so European oh my God I can't load anything where is this look this looks like more a [ __ ] I can't make a guess here it looks like something North though like Illinois or like something no wait yeah okay Michigan h i kind of fumbled around five dude I was so convinced this was Europe I don't know why this looks so European to me for the longest time like this feel like these fences right here do not feel American like American fences at all and this pavement doesn't really feel American to me and then I saw this in the last second I was like wait that's that's a us like these Hills feel like I don't know looks kind of More Southern but I don't really want to I don't know how far south do I want to send I'm just going to hedge like a sh coko here I think ah it's just Tokyo of course it is gave me like uh Santa Fe Vibes but I don't know if it lines up really it doesn't really line up I can try that okay I think this is sumba just some classic sumba stuff over here I don't know I'm just going to go over here okay is that Dr this is kind of a wild Dr but I guess so um surely this is like Bach chica or something right it's just Northern Minas or bajia I'm going to just go for like a literal border look okay yeah all right it's next day what place did I get today 14th out of 25 could be worse could be worse could also be be better congrats to Ziggy Harrier and conas Harrier has been playing well yeah you know in hindsight maybe uh clicking toky would have been smart it looked Southern okay and you know why did I go there I don't know does it matter not really oops um ba was this actually ba yeah it was ba everyone getting arge round three was me wolf and uh Toro B bunch of sumba guessers I was about to go e that's probably an easy soon buff I spent more than five minutes playing uh this game A Day based North City guessers here uh yeah it's not really that easy because of the car I'll say this if there if we were playing with a no car script on I don't think Dominican Republic is in my top 40 guesses there that was a wild location round five was just standard Brazil yeah pretty boring day to be honest pretty boring standard day click Tokyo and you win CP okay GG's got second 10 second though that's not boring it's actually not a boring day at all it's a great day let's see how we did I want I'm curious to see how many people went Europe on round four I think Round One S South Africa boring yeah all over Mongolia there Capital round three what was this bulgar we had the Bulgarian pole it's like the Lavan pole but like in Bulgaria that thing you know where it's like alternating fun fact I think that's B and I maybe just SL to you um yeah and then all of the that makes sense this looks so European to me like I don't blame those guesses at all like at all and then round five base Deb guess to win it all in Lake Michigan Ziggy getting four Harrier getting seven and consus taking a lead at 15 marginally he could uh cons has two days to finish actually technically so do a blinky all right and then 10 second was Dee first three I'll take five and Ziggy we get four not too shabby all right I will see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

the courage to even look at the location anymore because I'm just going to actually get upset with myself oh my god oh my god dude look at the seed I just had and I do that drastically drastically sad right now all right I try not to get upset on camera because I think it's like a bad look optically to like rage on camera I don't want to be known as like the guy that like but like I unironically could have punch punched my monitor right there and I like I would have felt justified by doing that just get this 10- second over with dude I don't even want to think about that last game anymore

wolf or west all right and then 10 second Blinky RC and consis what great company I got e on this one I'm assuming it's because my Ukraine guess because I think I played well elsewhere 29 people

"it's another day of some which also means it's another day to use your Noggin hopefully everyone's locked in because we have another random Argentina okay we're sitting quick today oh this looks fun ever done I mean it's going be a random body of water I guess looks fairly big though I'll go it's north I'll go here it's a safe hedge in the center it's in the center dude uh I mean yeah I mean sure what was I forgot what ones oh okay Europe up what you do here you go Catia here or you go Slovenia or what is this I hate Urban Europe dude it's actually I'm actually really bad at it give me der Road or something yeah I don't really see it being anything besides Slovenia Croatia something I'm g go Slovenia I guess it could be like a weird o no should just be here surely single white makes me think more Catia so okay was ctia um but I got pretty bad points okay this is interesting kind want to go like somewhere over here like I don't know it's like it feels southernish I don't think it's banin though so maybe like on the way to banin is my best it could even be something like this but I think it's like on the way to banan I don't see it being that North hopefully I'm wrong or hope wait it's around four oh no I mean so it's around four so it's just inevitable this is a bad guess [Music] right uh poor hardore they like near fine round three or round five this is kind of a sleeper seed to be honest but I can lock in here I mean the obvious guess here is just do like right here um I'm going to go slight I'm going to go like some something like this because it feels more Eastern damn I thre someone 24K is that I think that's a pretty easy seed uh it's a pretty easy seed yeah I don't think anyone even misses a country there I mean besides the Croatia most of them are pretty gimes I would say and I got like yeah I didn't really lose that many points but you can pick up points pretty easily someone like Blinky definitely 24K is this I had a good Argentine I guess so we'll take that and then the rainbow world let's see the new map RC is still in first okay has a 24K now wait what was his seed that's kind of a good seed or that's kind of a good he had good that's a good game not easy great okay all right can anyone beat 24K $100 on a line all right 10 seconds on the clock this might be a more Ur let me paste this link real quick sweet all right 10 seconds let's do it a rainbolt world round one looks like is that the Ireland triangle it is okay I think that yellow diamond is a um freck do you go north dude it's just Bankok I might literally just like we have the double sign post but this does not look like there so I'm GNA not go there okay why is where is this bro wait was that I have to go back and look at that oh this is that's actually kind of frustrating I me this is a pretty standard day it's just North Korea okay right let's see round four it was wait was it oh no it was a smaller River going into it that's a pretty cool Road I didn't know where the elevation looked like that that's kind of cool kind of trippy but um that's actually really good lock I like that a lot all right I mean did I blunder anything oh I blunder Thailand yeah but as one does but yeah it's a pretty C Day across the board but we'll be very high scoring games but let's see how everyone else does all right it's the next day and it looks like they added the white borders back to the guesses I kind of like it to be honest looks a lot better in my opinion looks more OG all right what was this this was the two or the 4 second and okay yeah this is a fun one no one no one got 24K but snail did get 237 so GG's Snell Jacob and consis Jacob they go I think Jacob's first placement um sweet okay so round one oh I have to s Everyone what am I doing 27 people playing all right round one Jake was closest this is everyone getting kind of the Western South Argentina Vibes there round two what place I get I got 14th round two was Ukraine a lot of people going on this body down here a lot of people going on this River up here um not too bad round three Catia a lot of people in ctia here so that's always good Tricor great guest round four was Nigeria great gu by bag a lot of people getting the East I should have went more East I don't know what I was doing I was hedging round four or and round five five was just zah and I literally clicked the 5K and moved away and all of the devs are chilling over there in Australia together it's kind of goals sweet congrats to snail Jacob and conas and then the 10-sec on the rainbow world where I threw the Thailand I got seventh and 24 people played this one let's see what happened here round one Ireland some people seeing the diamonds some people probably not round two Thailand H yeah it looked it looked North but gra great the Bangkok guess always does it for you yeah kind of all over Thailand there makes sense and then round three was this kind of brought me back into the game because a lot people went Northeast there was just Kentucky or was it West Virginia West Virginia country raids this was a good I mean yeah a lot of people went kind of this region CU back yeah maybe that was a bad gu on my end I just not see anything like that and the round five was just SK pretty standard day across the board Snell getting seven Jacob getting two and consis getting 14 oh dude we have a three-way tie

right it's another day of some Jer and it's also another day to use your Noggin and to have a good date round one looks like Northern Argentina I almost want to go really like North here yeah not like not like Paraguay but like somewhere like over here actually kind of do like like over here let's see yeah I do I like it a lot and that's a great guess round two let's keep it let's let's keep it going let's lock in round two okay this is uh not easy immediate thoughts here are Baltic SL northern Europe obviously um I like Baltic this hill is weird this is a weird Hill like elevation on the side right here I like Baltic I like Sweden I like Finland but I like Baltic most I think what is this thing right here that posts in the ground I've never seen that I guess is it every like Poland do I switch last second to Poland that's probably just Baltic it was Poland nice this is good this is good round three this canal what's this house what is this I know my forehead's probably so big on camera is this like France I thought it was like the UK first or like but it doesn't really look this house doesn't really look you know oev I think I go France here I don't know where else to go guys I'm sorry this is weird I'm gonna go central France czechia seriously I don't know this what is this house it's like like a freaking cat I could see myself maybe going Slovenia here I never go to check with that house though I can see myself going Austria or Slovenia actually I don't see myself going Chaka though kind of cool I mean yeah that's that could be worse I guess but probably will take us away from winning I'm sure just go east yeah just North okay round five oh Lord okay this should be South right do you ever go like here or is it too risky I am I being overly confident here that this is just Russia or like this part of Russia because I think it could be like something like this also is it ever like this actually like by the border of Ukraine uh I'm having commitment issues I've already kind of lost this seed because that chicky I guess but uh frck yeah I'm gonna go somewhere over [Music] here Nova subers there's not very many more points I could have lost in Russia there I mean that was just a colossal failure I mean I had a great Argentina guess I had a great I don't think this Poland's easy maybe it is that's check never getting and that I thought just west and I was just kind of overly confidently committing West to West and since bag won to 10c we had to use a new map and I was like what map do I use and I was like wait I had a custom map made for the tournament finals um for the tournament finals that I do that I did season zero where it was like meant to be competitive um for the tournament and so this is the tournament map that I I'm just going to release it was made by SLP we work together on like country distribution the rur the urban so for content I think there's 8,000 Urban locks in this map out of 110,000 um and then there's it's broken down by dirt roads Urban Coastal Rural and um just like random fill locations so it's a rural focused map but there is more urban than what we've had before so it will be fun and I can do some more urban guessing but it will be easier but also it's good for you guys if you guys want to like learn or like play like I I I think it's actually a really really good map I mean I used it for freaking competitive tournament for the best players in the world so um shout out to SLB also do you guys need to add that thing that fortnite has where it's like you get comp or you get compensation based off how many people play your maps have you seen that like graph or like that chart of like fortnite map makers making like $400,000 a month or like at least the outliers imagine you guys her I it's actually not that bad I mean not that skill obviously because you know map game isn't as big as fortnite but I mean if you have people like the Sidman making maps to play like you actually probably get more of a user base you know to towards your game and if you give them all right round one this is not easy Norway I [Music] guess I mean rainbow world I have to lock in for it bro you have to lock in for the rainbow world this looks like Portugal that was not Portuguese [Music] plate maybe it was we have to go Christ Church can I find new Ze on the map dude you see that I mean maybe even ah Nelson wait is that where The Vineyards are was there Vineyards here that's such a free Nelson bro all right it's fine this is the US wait wait that was that took me a second to figure out that was California you go France or Romania I think it's a french plate if this is Romania ah nice dude I played pretty well I played that really well it took me a second to realize it was California and I think people not everyone gets this because it looks so European Whoever has the highest nmz record on rainbow world 10 second npz all them or PayPal you $100 okay but yeah I'll see

incident locking bro I was thinking like Poland maybe CA okay I need to copy right it's 2019 I'm thinking like here okay I think it's oh yeah we do have the okay I almost didn't see the St uh I okay I

"everyone lock in it's time to use your nogin I've got good guesses to be made with no time to waste round one surely it's can't up I'm going somewhere Eastern maybe even like I don't know like up here maybe come [Music] back main how about you main your business West surely it's one of these roads right here how's it that South literally get GP Finland um do I ever go down here Bridges no go a little more North ah with been a good guess that's [Music] okay okay um you guys like the thing I'm doing today where I just play really fast listen I'm not going to cope I can't cope or anything okay let's keep it going just play the game and see how we do just play the game and see how we do that's all we can ask for okay this is not easy oh 10 seconds I forgot I'm going Netherlands dude Denmark can literally what is this Hungary Bulgaria looks like Bulgarian pavement Peru or Argentina uh somewhere over here I guess okay uh this hasy Poland no Belgium uh Poland yeah Poland po Poland North surely okay I'm going to cope on this one I'm coping how is this ever DeMark dude this the second day in the row of like gun Denmark I mean yeah sure I mean it's just a [ __ ] rainforest in Europe Okay Belgium Netherlands Poland are all good guesses here anything else is not a good guess round two this is never oh it's in the national park where did I go here wait where is this is Slovenia no this is Croatia uh sure yeah it's like maybe getable I don't think very many people get C I mean yeah crotia is actually ctia is only Gable here because when you don't know where it is in rur Europe you just go Croatia it's not that you actually know it it's that nothing else makes sense so you just go Croatia that's kind of like the state of this country right now obviously facing uh South this is way easier CTI because of yellow sign there but that was like the fastest I've ever done seeds Okay I'm kind of proud myself I enjoy going fast okay it's kind of fun yeah I mean that was a pretty difficult seed to be honest I'm not going to lie that was pretty difficult and I had a good round five yes there so all things if I was to rate this day on like a SC on 10 it's like a six and a half seven maybe could be better could be worse okay let's see how everyone else does Manny maybe no it doesn't look like Manny man no what would have black car I'm actually kind of confused I don't know is it like uh Ontario or no I don't know where is this I was main doesn't look like there but also RC literally got me out of bed this so if I look super tired it's cuz I was doing off and this r grind okay the things I do for the daily challenge okay mhm exactly where is this I don't know maybe it's like dude I don't like my guess I don't know where it is though it was down here damn Sweden maybe I don't know there bro [Music] refund that's wild it's like is it just like here wait oh w Really okay it's kind but maybe it's like here somewhere I don't know yeah okay it was just a b i kind of threw on a lot of the rounds bro how is this what is this Peru though like this doesn't look like Peru what is this soil color this doesn't look like Peru and this bush doesn't look Peruvian what bro nothing in this round looks per like I saw the mountain I don't know North so you're like to be in the southern hemisphere oh true all right next day totic bag de top three I got six all right 25 people playing today not too shabby did any Debs beat anyone no that's okay tomorrow is a new day how did everyone do round one anyone remember the I realized this after the fact guys but this is the same main road we had where I went Manitoba last time um but it's the Golden Road I think is what it was called think bag bag remembered it potic remembered it but now I would get it the same I'll get it this time um couple Europe kind of all over the us or all over the Canada us here I don't think my Quebec guess makes too much sense but we'll take the points what the heck oh sorry um dude the amount of Northern Peru guas is here I mean to be fair it's kind of hard to go that South unless you're tricked her and got the right Road and bro what dude what happened to tricker in round one dude look at tricker's score 49 46 4549 what oh because he went Manitoba dude that's tragic see that's like why J here sometimes is like unfortunate because like I do not deserve like overall the better game was obviously him is my does my me going Quebec rather than MOBA on a main really you deserve that many more points no that's just like yeah that's that's that's how it works though but that's a crazy I mean that was like insane Pace all right uh round two why does it keep doing that okay that was a chil round three was this Finland dude RC got like the second most points by he's the only one wait what it round three 46 he got how many points he he got 46 he beat wait 46 21 he literally got the second most points by going Sweden that's actually hilarious oh my God that's so funny okay I mean that's that's what I'm saying the scoring system is and then Argentina yeah good guess by RC consis Harrier and Toro again to sh and round five was Thea which is pretty standard meant to click middle and for the 10 second we need bag to have one point he was in third place as I was recording last night with RC so will he's still be in third and will the 22nd or 10c seed be reset yes bag has done it and 20 only 22 people finish this one okay guys I'm this was a hard seat I don't blame people for not finishing all right round one was the Denmark base nether guessers Ziggy getting denar and I'm not sure how you get denark there I'm just really not sure uh okay base LLY guess base I realized I called this pavement because I thought this was pavement but then I remember watching the video back and I realized it's just gravel but that it looks like in the moment it looked like speckled pavement so I was like oh yeah it's definitely like turkey Bulgaria you know and then the pr guas yeah this is a hard Peru um pretty hard Peru but yeah shout out to everyone that got that bag getting closest there on round four was Argentina just ba yeah I mean that was Argentina pole there and then Northern Poland everyone going north Poland there if they went pulling so that's always good and then yeah all over Europe there so that's the thing I feel like uh if you guys don't know I have a lot of people comment this but um for most people we could see the uh polish Pole right here but it's kind of unfair because on nmz when you're playing geoguesser it goes off your monitor um so like if you have a smaller monitor um to I don't know exactly how it works but basically if you have a smaller monitor it you don't get to see the same thing as everyone else so that's why when I do tournaments I make sure everyone has the same when I host tournaments I make sure everyone has the same uh what it Dimensions or or whatever um so everyone sees the same thing so if like people that have wider monitors they see wider of the screen which is unfair because you get get a corner of a Polish pole there um but it is kind of a disadvantage and it's kind of like controversial because uh you have a water monitor sometimes you can't see the car because it's like proportionally stretched or something I don't know but that is a thing all right totic getting 14 oh Ty the lead bag getting bag bag bag bag bag bag 13 and debre getting 10 do this wait the 40 second is coming down the wire here and then on the 10 second we have Ziggy which is the final you get six axle think Axel Axel gets two and bag gets 20 and this was the first of 20 wins so the 10-sec will be a different map tomorrow and I will see you guys tomorrow congrats on bag for winning ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

"it's another day of some jser it's also another day to use your Noggin hopefully everyone's having a great day and I think you guys all know where I'm about to click hopefully you do you can't blame me round two guess this just down here mountains North yeah round three is this New Zealand what is this wait let's let's think looks like New Zealand to me am I tripping No it should just be New Zealand I don't really know where else this could be these Hills fil New Zealand is let's go north island I guess I don't know it's kind of is weird for me it's like I don't know I guess it could be South but we'll see best guess I have is like Central North Island somewhere up here okay be up here even yeah I think this is [Music] fine L South there but it's fine was North Island all right let's lock in okay guys I actually think it might be this kind of similar region over here in New Mexico CU I remember RC was showing me like what this place we had the round over here and he was like show me what this looked like over here I could always be Texas don't get me wrong and he clicked somewhere over here in accident and it looked like this with these Hills but I'm going to go somewhere over here again in like border of New Mexico Texas I think it's round four so hope have a round four blunder here that would be problematic yeah let just southern Texas dude okay let's lock in I mean it's north the question is do you go Mound okay so you go Mound or do you ever go up here on one of these white roads like that one time do I risk it for the biscuit is a question it kind of just looks like Mound though and I feel like I but whoa I could pick up a lot of points if it's just North I'm doing it you guys can't stop me because I've already lost the seed it's gonna be Mountain I just know it's gonna be [Music] Mountain oh well that's awkward losing 1400 points on uh bot Swan is not the really way you want to go out it's so Sandy bro it looks so North to me Hey listen it happens okay it happens pretty standard seed though that was a pretty standard seed nothing too crazy on that one but this is one of those seeds where like everyone gets every single country right I think so it's like it comes down to like you know someone picks up another thousand points in Texas and another thousand points B SW someone definitely 24K is the seed so I probably got like 10 to 15th Place on on 402 today which is fine so we can we're going to pop off and lock in on the 10c here no we're not what is [Music] this okay have to go like South Carolina Georgia okay uh surely you go north right I'm just going to go Central North it's East oh it's [ __ ] European turkey I'm so dumb [Music] what I mean water South I couldn't think of where water would be South and think like Cancun or yeah okay what is this bro oh man you're telling me this is Denmark who the hell goes Denmark on this I was confused because I saw this or there's like roof I was like that does not look like the UK and these houses don't really look that UK but I had nowhere to go wait let me cope about this Mexico round dude I suck holy [ __ ] we're looking at this I mean you can't really blame my Yucatan guess here it's like developed looks like tourism Beach town okay like Cancun you know or Yucatan Peninsula makes sense I guess wow that was not easy I'll say that but listen tomorrow's a new day and uh we'll see how we'll see how everyone else does wait is that the tuba bosk bro wait is it the iconic bro I feel like I have to go for it cuz it looks like it low key no it wasn't a tuba mosque yeah bro how do you not s the tuba mosque there that's like the most one of the most iconic places in okay what is this uh Chile but like yeah I kind of kind of thought of this road could be a different road but that was my first thought no okay I mean it's New Zealand I don't know is it no I don't think it's north is it Northland no I'm going to go like I'm I'm I'm going to go here I think okay look at you look at that yeah I mean I don't I don't really know how that's there maybe Ziggy will be like well actually well actually copyright for it's the US it's like Texas I think this is like out here somewhere like one of these roads um yeah I'm just going to send that okay bro nice wa you're in first don't don't choke bro don't choke I thought just like mountain or like could be even like here but I'm just going to go for like something over here oh no it's South you still got first though someone get hi Blinky hi Blinky did you play already Yes blink had one of the most dominant performances of all time besides one single gu I [ __ ] threw I [ __ ] threw that was that one guess bro that's it uh no your 10 seconds even more impressive in my opinion but well we'll see how that goes I got the butts down though that was kind of good wait did you get bot where' you go on Bots how' you go how' you get that Bots round I got to wait go back to his game to to how do you not go Mountain there though like actually it's too Sandy I don't know Sandy though guy talking more dry and more Sandy like Sandy is more West and one out wait yeah I went to but everyone did okay good good good good B guess all right if you be Blinky here I'll be all lock in um I mean it's just somewhere down here I think there um kind of feels like Georgia like here somewhere okay what is this like ever here okay is this a p of pinasco or is that crazy okay wait a second oh wait this is actually a repeat this is actually a repeat it's like this no shot or something but he knows the repeat but I'm closer oh no was there [ __ ] dude I knew I knew was a deark repeat God damn yeah I mean I know the repeat as well it's from some streak on stream right yeah it was from stre on stream yeah dude I mean I never I thought it was here for some reason I'm thinking of something I don't know damn you lost by like 100 points that's crazy yeah damn how' you get that Mex round both of you what the hell it's on this map you get this town a lot okay I've seen that round I think this round is might even be like on some zigzag videos I don't think many people got Mexico there yeah maybe like Ecuador or something I think I saw a lot in Brazil oh yeah still I guess okay but like without repeat do you ever go Denmark there or like what the hell no and I was so sure it was in Denmark as well when we had it on the stream yeah I mean the house does look Scandinavian but not really Danish like Swedish how's it look we were in Sweden mostly I we we Sweden we're like mostly considering Sweden and Norway I think well I was confused on this house and behind the trees here they like that roof that was was I was stuck on yeah I mean in 10 seconds like you you know your guess is wrong but you just don't know what else to guess and it's like the most helpless feeling you know all right so next St Let me refresh the page let's see how I did I got eth I mean that's fine that's fine you can't you can't win them all um we have 31 people playing today that's big 31 we'll see how everyone did some good names here I don't remember anything about this actually so let's see round one was oh the tuba okay surely everyone went tuba right also do I need to like mention the tuba reference or do you guys get it you guys get a tuba tuba mosque reference right surely round two was southern Chile great guess by Ziggy gelus and mackam myself is fourth on that couple more south couple more North but yeah all standard the New Zealand okay this one Ziggy somehow knew the White Road here I guess he does have the New Zealand world record for a reason um but look at this gravitational North that's kind of wait let's just remove to potic and that looks pretty op all right um yeah and then a couple okay so I'm GNA talk about something after this actually because this is going to be insane uh RC getting the road right yeah you guess saw that and then Texas couple New Mexico Blinky in the same region as last time um and the round five was B want to Yo Bas snail absolutely based guess um and then I'm assuming a lot mountain or North oh only consis harer trior and RC okay Blinky totic and Anna getting the right town there okay congrats I forgot how good RC also did but Blinky and RC had like one of the best days of GS or I've seen only 25 people have played this seed listen guys there's a six person drop off here let's you know it's okay if you have a bad score okay uh Blinky one of the most dominant like on a very hard SE one most dominant like performances in my opinion with 23k I mean RC only lost by 100 but Southeast uh ugu there round two that's pretty standard uh Georgia RC obviously you know is Georgian so him getting everyone going south though because it's th Pine couple uh Europe guesses yeah I mean in hindsight this is an obvious European turkey so um we also have Ballard I think people missed but yeah I just kind of clect Center because I didn't know round four yeah I don't know how I guess it's just a map meta but blinking RC getting the right town there Gus uh who who else is it I don't know avatars who is that dude Avatar oh Gorka dude Gorka please get profile picture what the heck okay Brazil yeah that makes sense I mean I didn't know where did I get here I got 16th here oh that's not that good I guess it was pretty yeah this one is a okay I don't think anyone that got Denmark here got it without it being a repeat I'll say it I I'm G to call it maybe bag did but RC and blankie both called it a repeat from a stream dude you never go to Denmark there like I'm sorry you just don't you you just never go DeMark on that you just don't based do me and Jers always have the same guesses look at this just holding hands over here two little smilees totic getting 11 RC getting 12 and de getting nine see who the 10 second oh no RC okay so BL link gets 12 RC gets 13 and bad gets 19 RC bumped bag off for the win ver needs one more point to win that's

"it's another day so you guys sir it's also another day to use that Noggin of ours round one all right lock in lock in we're doing well today we're doing well we're getting leaderboard we're proving our self worth by numbers on a map game that's what we're doing this looks like Eastern South Africa somewhere along like here from like maybe like East London up to like sers like mainly in this region right here is where I would guess though do I go like near Richard's Bay maybe do I go even more Inland mil mooth uh sure let me zoom out and see where I am on the map okay not bad round it two crazy crazy idea here guys I kind of just want to send Kangaroo Island okay it was my first thought immediately when it came in is it ever like rot Nest or or anything like that I don't think so I kind of just want to go kangaroo okay it was South Australia but it was Coastal thong sculpture yo yeah who's trying to go to the thong sculpture with your boy hey no guess I know Australians like their lingo it's a flip-flop no one calls it flip-flop bro and that's a free kangar Island not sure why it's misplaced shout out to the thong sculpture round three let's not choke this guys yesterday I called oh this is an easy Deval it's an easy Deval I'm the goat watch this be Deval this is actually [Music] Deval it wasn't actually Dev that's okay and this is not the country I want right now oh let's give Trevor something that he's not good at Russia okay expect approximately four points for me this game right now from this round because I have no idea I'm guessing it looks kind of like East but like there's a lake here uh I'm going I'm going west though I'm going like over here somewhere freak if I know bro it does look Western [Music] actually I should when is I I wasn't I zoomed in on Nova F bro and I realized one it's round four like there's no way this keeps happening and two there's no way I lose a seat if I go here like honestly there's no way I lose a seat if I if I just click space bar with 22 seconds left why can't I just click space bar 22 seconds left why why why can't I just go on to my life why I have to sit there and nap this is not my day oh and we're just going back to Australia dude what is this is this like inw I mean my me thought was like this could be like a weird Tasmania yeah do I use rip aazy do I use I think I might use razi because it's like I already lost the seed committing on something like Tasmania wouldn't be like that big of a deal because I already lost and I could pick up points if no one else goes t or not as many people go Tasmania if it is Tasmania or it's like some random like inner nssw or like Queens just Tasmania okay so story of this game is rusa the real question is can we find the thong sculpture it's it's north from it's like right here okay why does this have a POI on the map bro I mean respect respect what is this yo what are they dude what are they on over here in South Australia bro where are they at actually on I I want whatever they're having bro um yeah I mean fine I guess I just messed up in Russia so I'm getting no points but such such as life you know such as life all right 10 seconds and also such as life is not a cope that's just um that's just a uh self-affirmation round one 10 seconds let's lock in I want to go East dude Italy France course Italy France course Italy France course Italy [ __ ] it's Sor right what is this do you go Bulgaria D am I going to choke this check you I realized at the very end that it was checko I said it before I clicked it 10 seconds is not enough when you're bad all right I said checka I said listen it counts because I said checka I realized it was czechia after the fact after I was like it's kind of too late to switch that's a cope you can put that in the cope counter I don't care did I play good today no is this ever Italy no yes yeah probably somewhat free too but I don't hate my corsas here um let's see how everyone else does South Africa yeah is it like here okay is this that one o Road we had I don't know should I go for it it was like here I'll go for it yeah okay it was here it's probably SEO yeah I think it's just a standard SEO why is that there surely it's like call me arill here what that's Toms [ __ ] dude I kind of want to go Taz do I go it's not Taz like what is it okay it is Taz Oh my God I thought Taz and I I was like so scared to send it for some reason jeez all right it's the next day how do we do I got six on the 10 seconds or the 40 second that's actually pretty good how many people we have 25 people playing today shout out to those 25 How We Do how we do what was this one this one was the Russia one yeah okay round one pretty standard um South Africa with these uh or like the eastern coast without green it wasn't the overall vegetation I like the East London guesses by trior or by uh lley and snail click Durban great guess every going most people going South Africa this was sa anyone yeah Axel and G with me in kangar Island RC in the right Road I remember he mentioned that this was the same road that we had in the first 30 World Challenge if you guys remember a couple weeks ago um I just didn't remember it because it was fac a different direction looked way different but RC is that guy okay um but lots of people getting here based off the sand the white soil uh great guas by my here and Philippines all people going Southern Philly there round four Russia look at all the people West here this is basically C basically just click closest in Russia and win um me and Jers have a lot of similar guesses here um lots of West but yeah in round five was Tasmania like 10 of us getting tazzy here um lots of people going everyone going Australia so that's always good um but I think for this one the reason why I went Tasmania here was because of these ferns and these spiky plants all right and then 10 second I got fourth uh 25 people also play this one let's see which one which one was this I already forget the seeds round one was oh the turkey that a great gelous hey me and gelous are just twps in a pod today I guess that's always a good company to be in wait where did a lot of people went a couple Greece couple Spain um yeah Italy snail we like to see the Cora guess Blinky with a great Italy guess only like five people going Italy is that Mika in Italy yo mik the goat shout out to you guesser um lots of France guessers here um with myself and kind of all over Europe round three ccka only consis is getting czechia here look at the bul guessers here you're validated if you went Bulgaria or Hungary if I had 10 more if I had two more seconds I would have been there cope and the round four Sweden Stockholm clickers rise based jous water hedge was just

Italy like I've never seen this fire hydrant or whatever this is in Italy I guess I've never seen it anywhere these poles right here feel like they could be Italian maybe I go like Eastern Italy somewhere over here and hedge Slovenia oh that makes a lot of sense okay I mean sure I was my vibes are right I guess all right round two let's do this argena right I think there's water East something like this is it ever ba don't think so it's like that road Mak sense it's a good guess again uh this Road doesn't really make sense because this Road's probably paved and this water is too far east but that's uh that's getable I would say because it's a North South Road all right Philly Shirley um wait yeah Shirley Philly I kind of go like seu hedge honestly could be devour or something but I don't know it looks pretty SAR to me actually so I'm going to go [Music] Dev eighty at least it wasn't round four you know at least it wasn't round four at least it wasn't round four all right let's do this this is interesting the yellow sign immediately made me want to go Sweden so I guess I'm going to go Sweden here but it looks weird cuz like it looks kind of Northern but like it also looks like South but also looks like it be like Baltic like what am I doing here uh no you have to go Sweden here I feel like it's never Baltic right or Finland doesn't look like Sweden like what am I doing going Finland but it's a yellow sign what am I [ __ ] it I mean just a colossal collapse just a colossal collapse there at the end I'm like this doesn't look anything like Sweden what am I trying to do here uh yeah mean look like Finland that sign confused me but I guess it makes sense all right it's actually not that bad let's do a 10-c hopefully we can keep uh a somewhat good game here 10 seconds on the clock let's do it looks like Romania or Serbia or something like that Romania H I was trying to go East whatever man I just get in the hills and the flat thing impossible why does this look so weird looks like a US fence oh my Long View I was born in Long View wait that's a second dude how many times am I going to get Texas wrong I just need to start sending Texas like if it's ever when in doubt that one doesn't count it literally glitched okay we don't want to play Four round games you want to play five round games okay new round that doesn't count I'm not only doing this because I got Texas wrong okay cope okay VOS stin uh [ __ ] okay when in doubt click France water South lock in Sur It's Brazil right is this Cala or something uh was it round four don't tell me that was round four please don't tell me that was round four it was round four it was round four I I don't want to look it was round four and that was Arch pain handle I was so confused I thought that was Uganda for a second I'm not GNA lie that's a Gable pan handle I think but I just didn't know where to guess 40 40 seconds maybe I resonate with this 10 seconds I pain a click somewhere in Brazil okay life goes on let's see how everyone else does is it Slovenia but it's like a weird Slovenia here okay yeah why don't I know this road recognize it maybe it's like here somewhere oh it was here okay why is there so much grass I don't know I mean that makes sense I guess not really sure what I want to go here maybe Lon here somewhere oh Max North okay that's fine and then surely Finland I'm just gonna kind of hedge over here no okay good good thing I didn't this is Island I think yeah surely um is this like France maybe okay what did this guy eat for breakfast I don't know where just go here oh bro what did this guy eat for breakfast oh your mom a [ __ ] is this uh Brazil still maybe okay what's what oh it was our oh my God that's kind of crazy what did that say I don't know what it said it said uh chatram it said chatram me the script okay you still me loser let's go oh man that would been funny that would really funny I went to North on the Brazil uh bro I was so stumped I think I sent you g that dude dude thank you I literally was one second away from sing I said I knew I wouldn't get it and I was like okay maybe Uganda somehow but the S makes so much sense for and handle I mean it does yeah it is the next day Buzzy coming first contest and trior how did I do 19th you know I didn't think my score weren't to 19th but I guess we're in good company here let's see what happened or how we did round one was the Slovenia dtis Bas guess a lot of people getting Slovenia here actually only one two three four five six seven people get Slovenia a lot of people going Italy in the middle there um couple Greece but yeah round two was Argentina and if we had the water East so Axel and totic and lot people going in this road right here so that's totic Buzzy conas and trior and axel getting closest lots of us kind of in the similar road on the East here I mean but uh yeah pretty good round three was Philippines I mean this is where this is where I blundered everything this is where that was my downfall around four yeah base Sweden guessers how did I I it literally was just a Philippines guess was it round four no okay thank God all right on 10 second I got fourth and Donis wait that's the second time Donis has bed me out of third place that's kind of crazy all right that get everyone here we have two GBS devs or employees playing m and Johan so if you see a Swedish flag probably you guys are employee and they're trying their best okay so you guys don't take anything away from them okay they may not be the best but they're trying the best that's all we can ask for lots of people going Island here um pretty standard round two Ziggy bro yeah France ukuk valid guesses all over Europe round three was Turkey Donis yo Donis let's go um yeah I know I got lucky there water South just clicked big city and this was a crazy what this round for was insane tons of Cambodia Thailand uh Uganda I was thinking Uganda a lot only people to get it right D totic and debor is Donis the top three G player my column here this is uh lots of Brazil guesses I didn't know where the hell I was guessing I just had to clict Brazil because I didn't know and then

"it's another day of some gser it's also another day to use a noggin as always round one let's do this okay this looks like Thailand actually where do you go indo I have rubber trees I kind Go Thailand Okay so rubber trees Let's do let's do some thinking here rubber trees usually are South maybe over here like isaya or like up here and like b or like unani that's that's but this right here doesn't really feel like Peninsula to me I'm going go Petra [Music] bun more North okay sure we'll take that though round two Ukraine okay I don't really know how to re UK crane so I'm just going to click Center lowy and it pays off is okay this will be fun this is Cambodia let's use our nogan I mean the safe answer is just non pin we go up here maybe a good guess but I think we can go south somewhere down by the [Music] capital all right it's okay we're not really losing that many points it's a small country this is where we need to get guest today though in Brazil that's a weird PLL that I feel like I should know what that poll means but I don't unfortunately if that even does mean anything feels weirdly am it like M Gro or like para or something North such red soil I don't know I'm GNA go somewhere like over [Music] here that's pretty good that's really good now let's not choke the final round here what is this this looks like a distinct Hill I should know I mean am I going to choke this is this Alaska or is it just Yukon or something up here I think I'm kind of want to go Alaska here to be honest I don't know I could go on the border I don't know if this is last or Yukon to be honest or like anywhere in like Northern like Northwest Territories or up here don't know it was just youon I'm sad as hell why did I go to Alaska there I was playing so well man all right fix imposter set up dirty World 10 seconds let's do this that Yukon guess do Define me it's how you react to the guess that defines me and that's going to be hopefully well Peninsula Peninsula I'm going Peninsula I'm going Peninsula seriously bro that's kind of lame if I were you is that Portugal I could tell let's go [Music] scotlands Nebraska something like that no like Kansas something yeah Houston we have a problem like what the [ __ ] not my day how how many times am I gonna get Texas wrong before I get it right you know like I just don't think of Texas as this like it's just a skill issue but like Bowmont Texas [ __ ] you like if you live in bont or within M graus respectfully don't is this was this port that was that was on the I mean that's basically Portugal let's be honest how's this not peninsula look how rainy and like tropical it is like you'd be a fool not to go peninsula here actually wasn't that bad of a day I just suck at the US I guess wait it was round [Music] four I'm never being the allegations I'm just not I'm just never be in allegations that's okay let's see how everyone else does guys it's currently 5:00 a.m. for RC I'm not sure why this guy's up the don't say that bro you don't need to know bro decid to wake up to play G here that's respect okay lock in uh maybe I thought I would just say like a like a lamp SRA sort of thing oh dude it was Ty oh my God I was gonna like I was thinking Thailand at first and I was like n it's just cuz I was looking at too much Thailand he sto playing Thailand to come record this and then he oh my God so I'm thinking Neo is probably the most likely um what else is possible I don't feel like it's mikol um yeah I think it's Neo or like somewhere in this General Valley over here okay yep okay bro that's hey I know my I know my Ukraine I know the dry coverage is like throwing me off because I know I kind want to go here but that's wrong no I'm going to go near Fen idea one is like here somewhere an idea to is like this road um okay not exactly but yeah I'll just uh go here somewhere I think okay yep this looks like the US am I crazy for that no yeah I am crazy no okay okay good nice yay you know what would be really fun right now yeah because you [Music] joined all right it's next day let's go through this quickly no one really cares about the scores um I got first somehow today most undeserved first place I think ever um because it literally went Yukon on Alaska or Alaska on Yukon but we'll see I'm assuming no one just got Thailand yeah well I mean technically like I played like maybe nine hours of Thailand this week so I probably only got that because I thought everything looked like Thailand so I probably was lucky um I don't know how you ever go that border though but yeah we had a couple three people North Paya Peninsula Malay IND lots of IND lots of Bangladesh all valid guesses but the rubber trees for me look like that RC making go to guess in Ukraine per usual Cambodia lots of capital clickers base bad guess as usual round four mat Gro anyone yep couple parro guessers and then a couple South yep all standard Hedges round five was the Ziggy look at my little brother over here and axel based Alaska guessers and some good company over here um but was just Yukon I feel like on this map you have to go on the Ross River Road on the six here because it is kind of clustered there a lot I would say but now I know you know now I know and then a 10 second I got 13th and RC one congrats RC CG getting second totic getting third let's see I no base for zigzag for timing out round one and still finishing the seed you have to respect it Round One Thailand Bas mackam guess I stand by the peninsula guess here Northern guesses are okay in my head too listen how's it ever here okay round two Spain the S is silent because it is Portugal base zigzag Ziggy snail and Gorka wait Gorka thank you for the validation gor the Spanish goat okay round three Scotland bag did bag make a guess to bag finish the seed don't think he did dude bag is just not he's trying not to win he's trying to give us more times to finish Italy France totic how did dang that was close oh wait it was so CL it's like 100 points between first and fourth that's kind of crazy um yeah all over the US here couple in South America too round five just Ireland dude if totic just clicked Center Ireland he would have won but he tried going for the map meta like I did up here in the this Northern Ireland part that's crazy a dude he would have won that's crazy CG probably would have won to if everyone just clicks Center I guess but all right I'll take nine my will get two and Gorka get one RC getting 11 CG getting two and totic getting 12 Hey listen this is coming down like this is okay coming down to it coming down to it all right I have really no chance in either of them though so it doesn't really matter but that's okay because it's not over yet and I will see you guys tomorrow ",

one do they ma it's okay it's okay Donis it's okay let's see here let's see what we got going on round one was the Colo this was I think the one you can see the black tint on so that does make sense um but Mexico also but Mexico also does is a valid guess too obviously Greece wooden pole snail okay and trior gain the island congrats bunch of Island hedgers bunch of people going uh Mainland over there round three Queensland I surely had a good guess here yeah oh here are just enter Queensland there makes sense a lot all of us getting Queensland for the most part that's actually pretty impressive that all of us went Queensland there um so yeah good job round four what was this oh this was the graffiti oh one two three four five people getting po lots of enjoyers in Russia based Russia guessers in company over here lots of Baltic guessers also makes sense lost lots of Eastern European so not too shabby round five is yeah I mean you can't just click cono there I mean I don't know what to tell you um but yeah pretty standard and then the 10 second I got fifth okay bag got fourth and 20 2 3 seconds okay 30 people playing this one wait did I see that did Jami get J got 11th place with timing out on the 10-sec round oh dude poor guy that's actually horrible I would be so upset all right Guatemala everyone getting guat round two Colo col me 5050 as usual this was I like the SAS guessers here but Alberta great guesses um kind of looks like both of those regions round four oh this one was the the doozy a lots of people getting Borneo here that's impressive bag think Jami aan Blinky and consis getting Borneo also Harrier but going south srock uh yeah tons of Philly guers couple Thailand Malay but the wrong side Malay lots of Indo and then some South America um but yeah I mean wolf trer with a based Philippines guess to get close in Borneo that's actually really good because if he would have like seu or something he would have lost oh and he won by like 19 points too in second place that's crazy GG's and round five was yeah clickie not too shabby all right Blinky gets 14 tricker gets six and snail five and snail gets four and Blinky got first place in both so what a what a guy Blinky gets seven wolf gets two first two and aan gets three bag is holding on to hope but can he do it just needs two more points would be the craziest comeback ever if bag does not win this all right and Blinky taking a pretty good lead there in 10 seconds so awesome I will see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 11.461225674078966, "lng":

weird where do I even it doesn't look anywhere like the US Oklahoma okay I got Southern there for a second sure I was so confused in I'm sorry I didn't talk at all this looks like this uh pocket Brazil and the South uh do I even want to go Rio or like over here maybe more North it was literally just downtown Ria okay next round Sur you [Music] go south here too right yeah I'm not even trying to reach guess it you know like should just be fine should just be South should just clicked also okay wait this what I think it is I'm not tripping am I I it looks like it's just gen two but this looks like a what maybe it's just going uphill but this looks like a wide blur no am I tripping looks like a low cam that's embarrassing yeah it it's gen two right it look like lcan okay new is Europe so I didn't really care Mak it taking the risk okay uh montere I guess simmer over here could be more south but yeah I mean this is that these are cool rocks over here that's pretty cool shiny this is a very cool road too very pretty mountains are pretty sick all right I'm going to do something like over here it could be anywhere kind of in northern Mexico so bro I said that so confidently I said that way too confidently this is December 2023 C coverage what does this look like in Old coverage well that's easier I'm not going to lie I didn't know Chile what Chile looked like in December 2023 that's a cope I know but like actually the fact this St hasn't been covered in 11 years there's no way people don't go Mexico on this right like surely I have some peers in mind go Mexico on with me on this right all right well that was a fumble of a day I would say uh but like one good guess I would consider this Kansas guess like a decent guys Swit I fumbled that and then oh dud it's a round four choke again bro dude this is getting out of hand this is getting out of hand all right 10 seconds on the clock I feel like I be better on these than I do the others but we'll see why can I never get why why do I have to guess on the wrong side of order like hello this is never cool right this is always Mexico right this never color right guys this is never color right guys oh Lord dude what is this not it's not Canada right that's not Canada right guys let's see how everyone else does this was uh not good oo look at all these wind turbines so I'm thinking I mean it's us but I don't know I was thinking like Texas but it could be something else could be like Kansas or something but or Oklahoma I could split it and go Oklahoma I don't know I just associate wind turbines with Texas though is the thing I might go like a North Texas to HED sh out ah it was Oklahoma okay yeah can you tell that I literally cannot um what could this be Brazil really look like a Brazilian Pole Polo Philly dude I kind of want to go Philly I'm going to go Philly like a devour or something no it was Brazil damn Norway just your standard Osa this is interesting I guess it's just like France probably I think it's France I'm going to go just the middle okay Luxenberg I mean he's G make 2 24 copyright that's crazy I knew it is this ah wait okay is this like where is that new coverage is it like here I think it's like here somewhere actually yeah something like that yeah okay damn see I thought of it was a new coverage it was quite the day here let's see how many people played 27 not too bad M

with me wolf and Linley um lots of Italy guesses lots of France guesses lots of UK guesses which makes sense round five base Mexico guesses but it was just down here in Chile with 2024 copyright like um which is like the new coverage so just got got release like Chile arge Mexico I think are the only things that really Mak sense and that would make sense for arge and I think this is where the new update or new coverage or the new rotor added so that makes sense and Donis great great guess Donis all right 10 seconds this is probably one of my worst blunders of the of the series um but that's okay 20th Place life goes on life does go on let's see how everyone did uh great guess lots of people de getting a 4997 uh Blinky Don bag and Ziggy a lots of people going across the border here in

that by getting a great region guest here in eastern Romania listen we did it it's uh you know what it took me like a year two years and like 20 YouTube 20 YouTube shorts I don't think a single person

an infinite sub glitch okay listen I'll take my plaque okay yeah is a it's a Mickey Mouse plaque okay we've been through this I'll take my plaque okay I'll take it with pride is this the into the Zed surely right nope nope we don't want the AC on because that is white noise that's annoying for the video it's round four so it's only it's only m a matter of time before I throw this SE away um yeah I mean it should just be New Zealand I don't really know where though I'm just going go Central North isand here downtown ockland and bringing it home what a way to end the the 1 million congratulate congratulation video Thailand home oh that runs Alabama Arkansas I'm mid mountains west and it's like somewhere like over here I think I mean it's bunch of rice and stuff it could be East AF but where there's like mountains all around us actually where the hell is this I'll go somewhere northish it's going be like South I'm going lose out of points I'm just kidding I'm actually the freaking goat I mean lowkey if my first gets registered here I lowkey might have gotten first place now I [ __ ] up the New Zealand actually wait that's crazy yiki island is it whyi why shout out to shout out to people that live there um yeah I mean that that was a good that was a good day also I hit a million Subs yesterday but like if anyone is like uh I'm not new to this like listen if you mention you're about to hit a million Subs you lose Subs because people think it's he so I waited to get like 3,000 more okay until I'm not like a safe barrier where you guys can like troll now you know but I don't listen let me let me have my moment okay don't don't don't unsubscribe okay um all right that was good let me post this yeah I mean I don't really have much to cope about there it's probably because I'm just going to get mood I probably won't cope today but listen 10 seconds on the clock let's do [Music] this are we running back to the Zed [Music] no one stream on you twice stream on me this looks like Hungry Hippo Hungry Hungry Hippo I was hungry it's arge Mountain uh is every like down here I feel I feel like be more East but I'm not I'm not coping I'm not I guys you know how many times I've done that I've done that way too many times in my life I've done that way too many times in my life way too many times than I like to can we see the sun yeah we can but I mean it's not really North yeah I mean obviously in the distance here this uh these plants don't make sense to arge uh hey but listen I would like to think I will not be the only person in Argentina here and that is okay so we've all made silly guesses before all right let's see how everyone else does and um yeah thank you again for uh subscribing well actually you probably aren't even like if you're like you probably aren't even subscribed so like [ __ ] you but like if you are subscribed I mean like it's not like subscribers even mean anything though let's be honest like it's kind of just a number that is just kind of something to put myself worth attached to you know but see everyone else does okay this looks like we got ferns that's kind of surprising well it looked immediately like it might be like Montenegro or something but now with the ferns I would say it's itally and if we have ferns I think you just click like that click like this what I had the right Vibe initially yeah very flat Romania it could be like right there but I would say it's more likely to be like yeah or there this is actually just somewhere over here maybe doesn't just doesn't quite I mean it's actually here no yeah it's here D I wanted to go for a swag gu let's go here okay not terrible so I'd say this is like right here if not it would be Tasmania but that would be the strangest Tasmania of all 10 okay how is it down there why why heck Island didn't even know that had coverage on Gen 2 it does look like Indonesia so I might actually go there but if not then I would expect it's like in these mountains like passing through these mountains or something just going to go that okay I don't know what this is Romania again but winter coverage is kind of strange I'm going click on the border with hungry yeah oh it's actually kind of difficult obviously it looks like arge wait pretty sure this is wrong though Bast guess bro look at all of us down here wait oh you timed out but yeah I mean yeah I knew it wasn't a but it's 10 seconds I know I know you can yeah yeah comes down to that round three get you just have to get the round I still don't guess America I was considering Peru but then I couldn't think of anywhere flat enough that looks like this Mountains east is weird I was like H I don't know but like yeah it's a top class hard round like this even no moving I mean you have no car so it helps but yeah no car script here I think um I still think maybe I still think most people would go Mexico if they could look around everything yeah we have like yaka trees here or something I'm not sure tough ones [Music] yeah wait what is this oh my god dude about S I was so coping because it was obvious no antenna like and I was is it Serbia turkey or and I went [ __ ] Italy it's so dumb make sense with that though like it could be yeah I mean I was like literally my 50/50 in my head like Italy or ser and last seconds I was thinking toy and still right yeah actually like there's the I didn't think the car yeah I saw like what what's this car on the right and like why it's no antenna immediately thought it's only like or some weird I didn't even think about I thought this like I don't know the dust was just like covering the ant I don't know I mean this is the the round that I went Canada on it was Seria to be honest I don't remember where it was though oh yeah it was Max South I think it was the same road though Hungary probably yeah I think so yeah oh was Romania unlucky why am I trying to reaching this I don't know literally middle yep could be some weird place but I kind of thought Northwind I'll go like this Valley maybe okay nice okay almost almost scripted almost scripted that damn yeah I mean you could have is this like Chihuahua oh was us oh this is the area I was showing you to be honest I also should have got it with the sun very clearly being yeah it's okay I thought at first it might be like AR I don't know why in my head I was we have there's we have the Y I was showing you I was literally showing like two days ago like this exact stuff RC literally coped about this road for like 20 minutes two days ago and then I also coped about the Serbia

here North near upington like West one of these white roads near than maybe a bot um like really North up here so I'm going to do I'm going to do like this road over here it's probably paved there I'm going to red I don't think it's that East but we'll see little or not not West a little more East we'll take it okay we have a w pole and wall sign wall yellow sign here so Sur just go outside Perth maybe slightly more East I think by the way me I think is the green on the bottom of the pole there is well off so we have the yellow pole here which is I'm guess we're down here more West okay and then you get the red soil down or kind of like that I mean one would think you just go Bulgaria here right one would think I mean what else I only other answer would be maybe czechia maybe czechia but like I think you kind of have to go Bulgaria here right also guys I need to tell you guys something really bad that happened and it's not me getting this wrong that's also bad but it would be double bad it's just Easter Eastern Bulgaria dude umg removed their whole cat catalog off of Tik Tok and every single one of my t my old Tik tocks are muted bro have you ever gotten Snapchat from a girl no this is is muted now like it's not it like doesn't even live on Tik Tok anymore cuz there's no audio bro oh oh Brazilian dirt nope only on Instagram rles and YouTube shorts now bucko like why would you remove Winter Vivaldi off of Tik Tok those are probably getting like 100 views a day so it's not really that bad but like all right I ranted let's lock in for round four here oh interesting in ah intriguing round I mean Scandinavian surely I have to go Sweden I think Norway Sweden I don't know I guess it's one of the two it's never Finland this road doesn't really feel Finnish to me I'm having a actually I'm not really having that good a game so it's okay but we'll see guess I'll go somewhere like on the border here I don't really know where I'm guessing at all bro I forgot about Russia completely I'm not going to cope on that to be honest I'm not even going to cope on that that's just an L that's just oh what the hell I mean it's just the UK I guess what an L that was an l h whatever I mean I guess it could be Ireland but I it's hard for me to go Ireland on this because there's like literally nothing to go off of all right well that sucks because everyone's gonna get everything else there besides it's going to come down to that Russia I guess uh wait let me look at this 2023 copyright I mean I guess it did look weird not sure why I didn't think of Russia let's do 10 second hopefully I can play a little bit better here I mean I guess that was fine I really only made one bad guess I mean it's I've been pretty consistent 10 seconds on the clock Rada or [Music] M oh wow what a road what a road I stand by my guess there's a hill in the background is is this a hill there seems to be like some elevation back here let's go Discover it no this is weird like I've never seen a like that in batswana that was confusing I don't know how to explain it you know like it looks like there's like solid Greenery back there like you never see that much consistent Greenery in batswana all right that's kind of a cope but I'm glad I got that so I can there I'm glad I saw that so I can get it next time I what the hell is this the biggest hill in Uruguay huh do you ever go Ukraine here what the hell am I looking at this is a grass field all right lock in you have to go Southern Colo I know there's a road that RC Tau me down here with like the raindrops but like okay dude what is this seed what what is this bro Croatia Eastern Crow ever Slovenia what is this Spain hello I placed in Catia bro that's like 4,300 points I'm like I would be lying if I said I wasn't upset I mean antana and Serbia is wild bro how do you ever go Northern Croatia would have dude I would have done so well in the seed I feel like bro like that Ukraine guest isn't obvious and like this like you might have people go Italy or Spain or something like dude what a day full of me coping about umg timing out it's just a day full of sadness honestly it's unfortunate Russia going Scandinavia and Russia bro it's not my day it's just not my day all right Buzzy gelous top two dude I mean it just comes down to rush gu I don't know how I got third on this I guess like bro this most undeserving third ever bro but like how did I actually get third on this bro like toonic went Russia I guess it was the Slovakia like literally everywhere else whatever okay region guessing I I assume let's see what we got here round one like zah getting the right region of zah they're going pretty West risky but it did pay off it looked like that region to me round two wa to No Surprise good guess there by I think that's just Eddie which is Australian main um yeah most sping Western Australia because of the dirt pole and pole Bulgaria so RC looked at his map after this there's literally this road right here is the only road with that long anten and then there's a little patch right here um in Bulgaria with a long antenna with flag so none of these guyses Mak sense because none of this places in B have the antenna um but yeah check isak Hungary all about guesses because I think they also have that antenna all right some SK naan guessers With Me based Finland guessers no one quite in Sweden you know but Hey listen I got third so we'll take it Russia is not easy that's not I mean not very they all went yeah North yeah Baltic guessers yeah I mean we're all we're all over the world here but and then round five was just the UK a good guess there oh man yeah fun that was fun and then yes dude this one this one aggravates me the 10-sec one aggravates me so much because like no I wouldn't have 40 4,000 points like 20,900 like easily yeah like bro I could have like that was easily like fourth or third if it just count of my guess dude North po one no one getting up there but a lot of people going north because of the sand and and stuff urugay L people getting I guess that I don't know I guess now I know where the hills like that in Uruguay look like uh Ukraine lots of Russia guessers in Ukraine popped off here 21k yeah great Ukraine guess by consis bag with a great guess I went super South and then what was this no one got Serbia right dude I would have unironically I clicked like

go west over [Music] here was West over there okay round two okay this is a noggin user this is a got bring the Noggin out for this one all right I mean it's like Finland and Norway ever I don't really see I think it might be Finland we have like exposed rock on the side which is weird I might want to go like Southern Norway but Finland is also so like in my head it doesn't really look anything like Finland but I'm going to do it like if it's so like okay playing well we're playing well okay this another freebie so where do I want to go here I might feel Southern eswa maybe somewhere over here in between mountains that's kind of the reason only thing I have right now yeah I mean I'm not going to lose very many points I could just click Center and play play safe [Music] but we're playing pretty well right now now this is Thailand round four five I've only lost what 400 points that's pretty good I'm I'm gonna think about this one for a second though I think it might be just near Bangkok but like slightly East or like slightly South I think I just have to go east of bkock near P Paya I can't blender what is this planet right here it's Palms over there so maybe I go over here and R I'm stick over here by [Music] Bangkok H dude Thailand's so difficult what is this oh no is this Indo like these trees feel like why am I tripping wait I got think think this mountain this hill in the back feels like in Indo but I'm not sure what else does at all Malay it's not Thailand is it it's not Thailand is it Philly actually oh it could be Philly no oh man this is where it all comes crashing down I guess it's I don't know this could be like anywhere oh no how did I not think of Mexico wait what how is this road ever Mexico that looks like such a like concrete Philly Indo Road Tha Road [ __ ] dude I mean that's such a Gable Mexico and hindsight I'm not sure why I didn't think of it on some of these games sometimes my brain just like locks in on U on one certain thing and for some reason this hill in the back looked so like Southeast Asian to me like this formation here ug like does SU the wesy make sense as a guys here I mean honestly I don't know these trees fill Mexico maybe I don't know man like I don't think this is top 15 because I think 15 people get Mexico here like whatever man 40 seconds or 10 seconds on the clock I already have like three points in this so maybe I can I mean whatever let's just lock in I starta here no I kind of want to go the same in I place a little more south it was just more North okay for real really somewh around here nice guess is this Spain M on my perus there unfortunately dude I mean I play fine I just have one or two rounds I just kind mess up on I'm going back to this round yeah I mean this is a we'll see how everyone else did if does it feel like Lagos maybe or am I missing something dirty World shouldn't be too far from Lagos I just don't know which way or could it even be down here it's kind of Sandy I think I still like this area maybe yeah really does remind me of Norway or Sweden the road's really wide I don't think it's Finland um I think it looks like everything looks like Norway but I just don't know if the coverage feels particularly Norway to me uh please don't be us that would be embarrassing I'm going to go yeah okay wow okay really kind of feels quite Eastern to me maybe I'll tell you what this is Philippines Indo 2023 looks more like Philippines to me am I going to come up something better I'm going who goes in Mexico in that row two South I think ah I'm trusting Beast he and I don't know where I don't know which mountains these are click kind of middle here okay H still okay but east cape kind of vibe yo H Russian play is it no oh what language is that oh same school the same school wait what we have the same school wait I've never seen that happen what are the odds less time wait how does it how no no no it's kilometers it's kilometers oh yeah it's also kilometers what wait so I spent less by no no no no no it's no it's not decided on kilometers it's just decided on it's decided on score it's just that like on the on the um decimal score I got a better one like on the hidden score I got a better I think if you're like exactly even it's user ID like who registered earlier bur has a z so oh wait you mean like yeah wait who registered earlier actually I think so yeah you probably did how did I tell I think mine's like 209 or 201 no I'm 20 2019 I'm 2019 too I think okay but like it should go off it should go off time no this is kind of rigged what the [ __ ] just be like l or some [ __ ] okay Finland not Sweden um yeah I mean I don't know I would go like here oh my god dude I keep guessing the wrong side of the country thenn it should just be around here somewhere okay good o uh is a Mexico maybe where would it be like uh here that was my first thought I don't know I kind of yeah I kind of want to go for like here okay hey once again wow I went for the wrong side of the country but look at fourth place oh I got Donis off but well he should not be going Texas there yeah that's true that's true here okay good okay what is this is it that one part of Ireland you were watching a master at work okay good good it's looking like a fairly Northern sort of over here maybe bro you're cooking this is just uh here somewhere okay good well I actually cannot tell what is Spain oh my God you got 24 oh god dude I got so worried I I was I was lowkey thinking Mexico on the last one I was like wait what is this but looks so European all right today was a great day I mean tons of really funny moments good Donis getting knocked off RC uh popping off and G Mexico and then G 10 second 23 people finished the 402nd what did that place I got eth I got eighth without going Mexico so I'm going assume a lot of people we go we'll go and see it Nigeria we have a couple G guessers they winning in Ghana that's so Bas D is great guess there's no coverage there so little cheater but that's okay round two we have the Finland great guas by V Toro myself bunch of Finland couple Norway round three Esa everyone getting Esa boring uh Thailand RC great region in Thailand a lot of people going east guess CU of somewhat red soil couple Philly couple Indo and then this wow okay I have an Indonesia with me a lot of Philly guessers here at Thailand um all valid guesses but we do have like 10 Mexico so congrats to them there's more people in Mexico here then how many points I have so or the placement I am so I must have picked up points El Colo Donis Bren Austin Texas that is not Austin Texas looks like johis I'm sorry all right but yeah shout out to Buzzy where did Buzzy Place yeah so yeah I mean great guys and then the T I got ninth so standard top 10 day I guess but 29 people playing the 10se second we'll see I think a lot of people maybe miss the Spain last round dude wions just get their points dude RC this was an insane game from RC great Illy guess everyone getting ILY gota go you gota go in this region of Ireland on this map bunch of UK guessers round three couple South I'm the furthest south there is so that's an L around four yeah we had the lutu Hills South and I love the lutu uh hedge here because you know it's Gen 2 so I can't believe but you're hedging the corners around but yeah we had the mountain South so this was that's the reason why everyone went there and then yeah the Spain L Spain gor to with a great guess there Mexico a lot of Russia Romania turkey makes sense I mean that was not an easy Spain at all it's a very like hard Spain all right they getting three points gelus getting five and RC getting nine RC getting six totic getting nine and snail getting five I think snail's snail's literally been like in placement like six days in a row five days in a row now but I think it's always been third place poor guy all right let's see what who's leading here I think bag is still winning here I mean obviously but like by far yeah it's not even close um but 40 seconds it's a lot closer um so it's anyone's game there bags got to lock in for like two more days here so we'll

"it's another day of some G hopefully today I can keep up the momentum from yesterday but let's find out round one it's giving us a Colo Mexico 50-50 off the bat but I think this will just be Colo this look this would be a very weird Mech so I'm go north Colo yep let's keep it going round two okay this is interesting gen four okay I know like what is this sign I mean it's obviously the us or Canada and I immediately thought like this sign looked like one of those Manitoba signs but this doesn't really look like Manitoba and I don't really know where I guess I have to go cada here black Gen 4 maybe it is Manitoba what am I doing I don't know what I'm doing I don't know what Manitoba Gen 4 looks like candidly but we'll try something like that [ __ ] off dude I mean that's just frustrating Mount gamb here somewhere down here is that a stobby I don't think that that could be a stobby should be across the border somewhere at least gosh dude this going be like Northern Kenya or somewhere up here uh West that's frustrating that's frustrating okay but also how do you go main here bro that's a kind of CRA I mean I guess it's I don't know whatever bro a blunder a day keeps the doctor away I guess but like 10 seconds on the clock let's see if I can do better here I had like four oh rushia just this is sick with the freck round four this is the us H dude I was confused there I didn't know where to go I just clicked Central us because I didn't know all right I mean that was interesting I messed up my Russia gu and I messed up Virginia could no that's West Virginia this look kind of I mean these are Southern Pines here I think so I shouldn't know why I mean my guess didn't really make sense but I just need to get guess down cuz I didn't know where to go well all good things must come toing end right guys but um yeah we'll be back let's see how let's see how everyone else does maxer col probing Colo with the fence just feels quite Colo um yeah I'm going to say so I'm either thinking here or like here go for this one okay not neither but it's fine um what is this that's a strange sign I mean it should be Canada right um is it just like Ontario maybe I don't know or is it ever the US no surely not right I don't know I think like do I go for this I have no idea doesn't really look like here but I don't know where to go okay no did no one go us on that that's actually no one did no one did but Bas Bas eastern Ontario guessers are here I mean how do you ever go main on that France um I don't know don't know good I would say Vic Loki this could even be South Australia so I'm feeling like quite this way it was South Australia okay I should have I I should have gone for it I was thinking that these sorts of mountains would be around here maybe maybe slightly more South I don't know okay a little more North yeah third third place though nice all right let's see um I got 16th do you know was this which one was this I already forgot where did I blunder on this one oh the MOBA yeah all right round one great guess in col my opinion solid guess round one round two shout out to my mantoba guessers over here trctor Eddie and Gorka based no one getting Maine at all and only three people going us and they were kind of in the midwest all right France obvious one four sa border we take that couple Vic couple SA and then Kenya great guess by salvado and consus and then 10 second I got fourth I mean this one was kind of tough it's quite a drop off after 21,000 but we'll see yeah not a lot of people finish this one to be to be uh expected on hard ones people rage quit all right yeah great guess by Blinky there he's going downtown Joe round two Spain that Blinky got closest in Port sorry blinkie for saying your name you were actually in Spain snail was in Portugal great great uh that's actually a great Spain call out then you knew it was a border all right A lot of people going Northern Spain there though Russia yeah this one kind of did a lot Anna is that Harrier Harrier or totic to with a great guess to bro what happened to your avatar why does he look like that all right round four Colo yellow plate round five yeah this one was crazy wait totic low key wait oh yeah just messed up around yeah I mean great game we did have Southern Pines there but getting Virginia there is kind of nuts so congrats consis getting 11 tying Blinky bag getting 11 okay and RC getting eight may have a little race to the top here in the 40 second and up getting three trior getting six and snail getting four B still quite in the lead there

"it's another day of some jiger and today I'm locked in and I'm ready to use my nogin I'm going like somewhere South down here could be one of these cities per you have to go outside Lio this is going to be this looks like a similar region we had in that Mexico round the other day what is this I might go there because it looks kind of a similar like vegetation I'm not sure where else on earth looks like this Colo could be Brazil actually [Music] yeah I think I think between the two dude deep breaths I'm taking a walk Let's Take a Walk let's take a walk together you've been in this position before you've been in this position before don't choke it okay there's not a better game okay deep breaths deep breaths deep breaths your day today's your day Ringle today's your day today's your day yeah who's that on the New York Times that's me on the New York Times okay who's about to hit 1 million Subs I am okay you can do this you can do this okay let's do this okay okay I'm not I'm gonna lock in I'm gonna lock in come on come on is this Texas I hope this isn't South America oh [Music] lord it's okay that's okay I I don't I don't see how I really go New Mexico there that's okay I played so well that is the only place you could beat me potentially like I played so well and if I don't know if you guys noticed but in the beginning if I knew I just clicked I wasn't doing none of this cuz usually candidly I want these videos to be slightly longer for you guys and so I have to sit there and Yap for 40 second rounds so you know oh this could be here look let me go here you know and I'm not ever used to playing like that so if I feel like I know it and you know I thought about Mexico and I was like okay yeah like this looks like if I feel like I know the region I'm going to go there I'm going to think about when it matters what a relief I did not choke that you know you could consider that a choke but like I don't really think that's an easy New Mexico and my region gu in Texas was fine my heart R now is like beating out my chest you have no idea like that was a thrill all right lock in 10 seconds on the clock whatever happens this game I'm okay with but we got we got still lock in here Water West guess it makes sense [Music] Dutch right Belgium right this is Northeast Romania where's it check yours I think it's up here whatever ah I mean the flag you get this flag on the car and check get B Romania and this looks like Northeast Romania to me kind of a hard Bulgaria in my opinion so this also this house right here also felt kind of like that same region of Romania to me that's why I kind of committed cope all right good day it's a good day I needed today guys I needed today if I get bopped if I get bumped out the top three in the 42nd I'm going to be down bad but we'll see we'll see all right it looks fairly Southern somewhere around here I would say probably um yeah I'm just going to head check that okay Peru and let's see can I try to figure this one out so I thought like around here somewhere and I lowkey want to like line up the railroads there's a railroad here actually but doesn't really like that no we're probably more this way if anything here's a rail road we're going this one I don't know I can't line this up but I'll just go here somewhere I don't know okay h is this I have to think about this one got use my n um Mexico maybe like kind of yucat I guess like chapus I don't know yeah I'll do that okay oh it's this area again nice guess though I'm glad I got youan though okay South Africa this one is like somewhere I don't know which side I want to go or SL you just need go I'll go there okay I did want to go out east but this I presume is Texas or New Mexico if he script us and beats me I'm goingon to be so upset um like the yua is weird cuz makes me lead more New Mexico but everything else feels more Texas like that oil rig over here do I full send what I think in New Mexico like it's low key down here but is that crazy it's probably just like here somewhere okay no it's here dude you almost scripted there at the end to beat me we would have had like d okay I literally called the area you said as well so like that's actually a good guess um South Africa north feels like we're right here somewhere I don't know if there's a right Road here okay ah man of course trior got it it was a highway I should Brazil spiritos Santo presumably I think we can just send that middle of yeah okay Peru now what does this feel like a bit further north if I'm trusting the pole top it's Peru I don't know going to go chimbot that's fine on top it's good H wait why do I think it's Columbia or now I have no idea no no no just uh up north Netherlands or something yeah I committed a bit too much oh where is the antenna found again I remember go oh what yeah I don't ever go Bulgaria thereo what that's a crazy Sophia wait that just literally looks like Romania that's what I thought bro like how did you get B it's cuz it I looked like Romania but I knew it wasn't Romania so I thought maybe like I I don't know why it looks soan to me it looks like Northern like it looks like Ukraine border to me I don't know yeah it does but uh so I don't know how you just Vibes skill sh my end is what you're saying yeah I mean uh it's like different coverage periods like Romania doesn't do june Romania would be like August sep sorry next time I'll remember the month all right so Blinky literally just had to take away any ounce of Joy I had second place all things Ser will take a second place I still played great still made some good guesses then they blinkies Blinky so what do you want for me okay Nigeria lots of goinging okay so this is what's actually I'm gonna I'm gonna talk my talk be round one win round two win round three win round four win I just and he just got round five like oh yeah well at least I didn't go that West in in Nigeria okay blink I love you I love you Blinky I love you Blinky um okay Lima hedgers unite this was the mix of guess only me and GC got oh me and Blinky I thought I saw GC over here somewhere only me and Blinky getting that region um right but a lot of people still go to Mexico couple Europe couple South America a couple South East Asia I mean look at this guest over here by your boy just kind of calling a shot in South Africa there and then around five yep was just to the Texas or the New Mexico I'm surprised everyone getting uh kind of like this the general region of like Mexico Texas here but blink just kind of kind of just ratioed me there at the end unfortunately but um yeah such his life you can consider it a choke but and then the 10sec zigzag you guys POV he did it first so let's see everyone here round one yep water West makes sense two everyone getting the mountains there pretty distinct Hills this is the Peru yeah I'm kind of happy with the people going east this East with me it look too like this look too green to be that West but I'm getting North Vibes there in Peru couple Netherland guers here lots of us in Netherlands all scattered across Europe and then only two people G Bulgaria that's Eddie should be Eddie Yeah Eddie and RC and apparently RC knew that because oh the June coverage okay bro base Romania guessers base Czech Slovakia guessers okay all right so Blinky gets 11 rainbow gets three I'll take those three points I'm proud of those three points and then RC gets seven zigzag gets nine snail gets three and Eddie gets one all right I mean honestly guys like yeah like maybe you consider a fumble I kind of fumbled didn't I all whatever tomorrow's a new day can I keep up the streak or or uh will it come all crashing down Blinky takes the lead on the 4 second bag is still dominating 10 second so I'll see you guys

right it's another day of some Jas here I'm going to cut to the chase listen guys I'm um us my nogin I'm locked in let's do this yellow reflectors I think the sun's coming from the north which mean this is chil not Spain because this is a crazy round so then I'm going to go somewhere pretty dry like up here all right great guess great guess listen I told you guys I I I show up to they lock in okay listen listen wipe the hands off let's do this want to go like I'm not sh on or something like more South actually doesn't really feel that Northern it's defin be like Assan or Ean or like Eastern Thailand here okay let me think though yeah I don't know I mean this could be a bad guess but we'll see I might just HED something SL more West not losing that many points that's fine are we back in Spain we have a red flower here which mean we're in Spain it looks like it could be like somewhere like over here I think yeah I think something like this like Southwest Madrid um let's do this maybe more e something like that playing pretty well playing pretty well right now this Brazil yeah this looks pretty like interesting region this is around four five I really got lock in guys how many times have I choked round four a lot I might go Minas or like somewhere like over here is it ever more South I guess he's being more south like South poo actually oh man look super tropical like Coastal though I hope this is I hope it's not up here more [Music] North self control is a good characteristic to have and this looks Northern but like I don't [Music] know why if I said it looks Northern why did I just not like can I just finish one seed without throwing bro like just give me one seed without throwing please I can't do anything right bro I can't do anything right this is actually frustrating it's like three weeks it's like three days in a row now that I've just like just thrown and like this is going to be one of those things where it's like probably like a haido pole top or something that like I should know God dang it dude ah dude like and it all started on this Brazil like I swear I like zoomed in like right here bro I literally zoomed in right there and then talked myself out of it it's actually so frustrating like [ __ ] like why can't I just like play rocket League or something enjoy my life like why I have to play this map game bro oh man it's a new late it's a new me just lock it in do well let just lock it in do well going it looks North bro it looks North for me twice jam on you for me Co mix all right post rainbolt talking here dude this game I look so much more depressed than I am I think it's more funny than anything in hindsight because it's just comical how three rounds are always like out of my mind and then the final two is like so consistently like such a throw like do not like this guy has like zero like clutch jeans at all it's actually insane but I don't want the The Vibes are down right now in this but like it's all good because it's it's really not that deep it's deep for like four seconds and I'm like okay it's a freaking map game I don't really care that much but I'm still competitive and it still sucks I'm yapping but we'll see how everyone else does because at the end of the day this is geog guesser not Geo knower it's okay to get things wrong okay it just sucks when you're playing with your friends and you want to do well all right it's the next day or it's yeah technically the next day this video will be out probably a little bit earlier than usual because I woke up at 3:00 a.m. to watch the Chiefs Ravens game was worth it it's worth it and then we get the LI 49ers okay so I'm G to upload this right here before the game up game starts okay yeah I went to bed at 700 p.m. so I wake up with 3 A.M yeah okay there's nothing else what else I'm supposed to do all right let's see also I like maled way too hard for me to get fifth place but like I guess it just shows how winnable this was if I if I locked in but still all right round one the Chile great guess by me here in Chile a lot of people do in Chile have an arch guess there and then some Spain because of yellow reflectors presumably but yeah I went North because of kind of how dry it was round two this is the Thailand yeah I went way too East there Donis it's okay man D is an AI this was the Spain lots of people get the region here in Spain okay I I remember that because it looks like maybe that fields or that type of stuff was kind of in that region of Spain round four Brazil okay a lot of people going south here in Brazil because zigzag and Jamal be getting good region guesses there but damn and then the haido yeah it didn't really look like the lcam um we had a couple H guesses couple North guesses um coup people going other lcam places but yeah all in all not too bad not too bad I dude it's it's like I'm never going to talk about that and then 10 second one I blundered yeah I got 10th here blundered the Mex Colo but I'm the second person to get get uh Colo or to go Colo or to miss Mexico in the top there go round one Philly oh I gota do everyone maybe not everyone has played yet because I um because it's been uh it's a little earlier than usual but y Manila a lot people getting Philippines there a couple people going Indo I mean everyone going south Sil I don't know what I saw but I'll take my central Sila West I guess I guess couple Java Philly round three this was the the Haida rounds that I did call that time finally everyone G Japan though that time and then BC yeah I went way too South on BC that one that was the start of my downfall there and then round five okay there's a good handful of my my friends here in Columbia so that's validating but great guess is there by clicking cdmx to my other friends all right Blinky gets eight trior gets three and Jami gets two bag get 16 trod first yep trip gets two and then snail gets yeah one yeah so I I'll update this cuz maybe F didn't play but if they did if someone gets top after this I'll go ahead and update a b this is the current standings right now um bag is up nine on the 10sec games which I guess is his specialty so it makes sense and then um yeah he's up one in the 40 second so we'll see we will see all right I'm going to go watch the 49ers liance game and I'll see you guys tomorrow are ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

right we're back with another day of some J hopefully everyone is ready to lock in and use your Noggin I am it's a dirty world I'm ready to lock in and do well do they this looks like stini so I'm going to go s because it looks like stin we have a mountain ridge ridge East should one of these white roads over here I mean this isn't the Mr Ridge is it I mean that Road's paved obviously but like it could be the same Ridge that's East cuz it looks pretty similar we could just be one of these dirt roads over here so I'm going to go on one of these dirt roads over here it was one of those dirt roads over there okay I it was slightly more North but the the ridge looked like the same Ridge that you would see on the M here so not too bad all right let's make sure we don't choke this surely this is Greek or Greece Sur it's like an island and we're playing the map where the last time we had a Greek island it was this one and I might just try and mapm it and go the same island but I don't think I should I think I should go like over here and create and I think I will I think I'll stick here and make a good guess it's definitely grease though we have we have water North though Northeast so I'm going to go something like one of these roads over [Music] here I should just hedged all this freaking thousands Islands over there and played my odds better this game is actually upsets me okay sorry it's okay it's okay it's okay okay round three what is this Seria or North mass or something lucky like North mass or like Serbia I mean immediately I thought like Bulgaria Romania but like I think it's actually more likely to be like North Mass actually like a weird like Southwest North Macedonia oh it was a southern Serbia okay I mean all in all not like I should just went Serbia whatever okay this is just somewhere over here do I want to go near Samara I think I might I think it might I don't think it it could be more West or something like that but I think something like this over here is going to be fine near train train train railroad track I mean I'm not going to try and scam for that but I like a guess over here somewhere it doesn't make sense with the J 4 winter coverage too so let try it let's wait 10 seconds for G guys to count our Vote or our guess just for it to tell us we're a th000 kilometers off like why what did I do to deserve this all right 10 seconds on the clock that last game does not define us but whatever happens in this game will dude and this J J cish is like it's unplayable it's just like unplayable to to play like single player right now like listen guys how am I supposed to wait 10 seconds after on a 10 second game like the Norway right I'm just going St lock in Sask Alberta or Manny it's Sask or Alberta hedging the Border was Northern is Sask surely just Northern Peru I cannot believe I fumbled that freck this looks like somewhere up here if it's [Music] South dude you know at the end of day the only person I can be upset with is myself is it Esa kind of looks like Esa this is like a weird looking Esa but I feel like it has to be right no I mean I don't know looks like you got to go so don't rethink it it's like here somewhere okay wait that was the ridge oh yeah that makes sense I guess don't know why I didn't think it was was like a Greek island I think I think so looks like one of those I'm going to say like Nexus maybe okay yeah works is it Ukraine I actually can't yeah it looks like Ukraine so it's like actually don't know which side or no wait is this Serb oh wait wait I'm throwing I'm actually throwing yeah no I think it's Serbia actually uh ignore that I was feeling a little silly okay anyways Russia I mean yeah um as for where I don't know it's like a the pet or something place okay okay you're 200 points behind oh man um South Africa but why is this so red it's like some stuff down here I feel like yeah g to say yeah okay good good good the lead bro by how many points 20 yeah 21 points 20 points sniped bro let's go wow uh Taiwan just guess middle okay that is Sweden and we have like an or White House orange roof is a bit like this area right so just going to guess it a b South here maybe oh you know observation did you see who made a guess last round but we don't see their name now I believe it was de quit after round one oh dude I want I'm sorry I don't mean to call out for not finishing seeds but that's funny no I mean you you have the right to call him out if you won the previous SE like at least like play out the other one if you're going to win the first one bro but okay you got you got a nice guess there hope I can catch up so RG wait is it is it arj or Canada uh yeah uh let's go here maybe okay not terrible task makes sense as well uh wow so Coastal Peru it's kind of G me South Vibes these mountains are so dry but I think this is like down here somewhere maybe 10 seconds later let's just let's just let's just ride this one out yeah we R it wow great guess thank you what was the final round I don't think that's winable for me we'll see no still two to go right one one okay feels like it's somewhere out here yeah sure I mean 10 seconds oh wow good timing it did look like Botswana that's for sure and I know like this side of the Border it's gen 3 and this side of the Border it's gen two so I could have got that maybe but 22 is okay the um either the Sweden or the Canada would have needed to be better if I want to win this but all right 40 seconds RC getting first de getting second and con get third bag just there behind with Blinky 27 people play the seed and I got 13th consistently around that 10 to 15 range it feels like for these last couple days yeah it could be worse round one eswa lots of people getting kind of the ridge over here Lota couple people going zah makes sense Greek Islands shout out to trior for some validation appreciate that homie um lot people do going in Greek Islands here a lot of people go in Greece have a couple of crotia guesses here so that's validation validating Spain everyone getting kind of Serbia Bulgaria North Mass um yeah a couple people North Mass with me a lot of people going Serbia all valid guesses I know it's just like there's this like force field around um this like Russia region because no one went West they like no one wanted to commit U but this was the downfall right here I was the one farthest east out of everyone so that's uh very unlucky for me I'm not sure why I tried to commit that but such as life and then the zah this one this guess makes no sense I just was kind of over it um but these these guys is down here are really good along the m mountains and then 10 seconds I got ninth okay top 10 that's fine 22 people played so a lot people did not finish the seed maybe after the round one guess they're like yeah I'm not doing this valid um so we had like a handful of people get Taiwan here 1 two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 so shout to them have couple Endo couple Colo things like that makes sense CU a black car everyone getting Sweden only a couple people getting Sask there a lot of people going Alberta but a couple people going us round four Anna let's go based Blinky based um unfortunately we have a couple Lima hedgers and then if you go south you do really well and then round five was the zah where I also kind of gave up but that's fine and we're getting South Africa there RC getting six points Deb getting five points and consis getting eight points zist getting his first points on this bag getting 13 and zigzag getting six oh am I doing all right bag is still in the lead from his first like three games but yeah we'll see people are sneaking up people are sneaking up all right I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations":

this is South Peninsula we have oil palms and we have River trees here if this is not South my name's not rainbow okay I'm going to go somewhere down here uh not too far south I mean it like it could be more south but I think it's like this is actually pretty fine throw maybe it could be like even yeah it's it's a safe [Music] hedge all things here will take that everyone will get that we lost points there if we play smart turkey do you want to go west I do personally I feel more Mediterranean like over here somewhere but listen uh um yeah I don't really know how Reon gets turkey like that I'm it might be more North though with these like trees so I'm do something like this lock [Music] in not the round I wanted and not the round I needed I'm not very good New Zealand at all if I'm being transparent with you guys I want to go north island here though I do want to go north island I do want to go somewhere Central North Island that's my call out if it's South Island so be it it looks like a place I would not want to visit therefore it's North Island that's the real meta in this game okay Palmer North something like this should be fine hopefully dude lock in lock in Argentina can we origin guess Argentina pretty well I hope so if I listen the story's been told before oh rainbolt good guess oh rainbolt good guess a rainbolt what happened bro you fell off what Happ why would you go why would you go ba on a clear lock in east west orientation should be somewhat South I want to go there's like no roads over here bro okay do I canit this South I don't think it's there's like no trees in this mountains North I moved away from please give me strength to finish this game please give me strength and we have another turkey and this is what ises this lock okay water South with hills this is like line up like like something like this we have water South there's another like random Islands spish between it's going to be along the coast over here surely right never we're not along the coast right I mean yeah obviously it's that's not like a something like this ever it's more South I just moved away again why that look so Coastal or why' that have to look like like what why have to look like a large body of water you know in hindsight like yeah it looks like a lake now that I look at it but like in my head I imagine this being like an Open Sea you know what does this say what there's a gester pin here nef City 82 anybody else's [Applause] childhood okay I mean like it's it's just a Tail's oldest time great three rounds but you're not able to finish it off you know I poed round for moving away last second and I thought that was a coast and not a lake all right 10 seconds let's do this hopefully I can placement only Le something today why does this look like that one like area down here okay was Ukraine that's fine should be cool ever east of the Andes tells oldest time get my guess off oh it was North gosh dang it this [Music] ever dude my my internet's like pooping the bed surely this is Finland right it's not Sweden [Music] right P around lock in wait this is that's the Dutch car [Music] boring all right I mean I fumbled a Colo how's that North I guess it's I don't know whatever whatever man I did my best that doesn't really look that North to me to be honest at all like how do you go north here is that a skill issue whatever well we'll see if I get validation for any other players but all things is here decent day but nothing to uh nothing to Standish okay I'm in Thailand and um it's uh Southern obviously but trying to figure out I'm going to go here ibe okay nice decent turkey oh we have these Chevrons these are um um eser here I believe might be wrong no okay I Mis remembered oh wait was was it Bali kashir ah dude I think I for I think I misremembered they all sound the same bro true generic AF um I'm going to go for like a here sort of guess maybe like I don't know how far south I want to go nope it was just north island that was I mean yeah it's okay bro I should know the the area here it's either here or like here but I kind of want to stick around the lake okay yeah this road yeah sure uh yeah this one of the locations of all time I don't know just clicked on the ler turkey I did actually crazy good guess yeah all right it's next day let's see how we did top 10 we'll take a top 10 take a little top 10 action you know this one's probably more likely how you did on Turkey B you think but we'll see oh no geler is what happened all right let's see round one Sou Thailand dtis it's okay bro we'll get back next time dtis isn't AI everyone getting turkey West Western turkey there lots of people getting getting South that's okay round three is in the New Zealand getting really close there Ziggy of course all think here most people going north island Argentina I moved away last second oh Donis great guess Blinky Kodiak RC all good guesses mackam not too bad round five there the other turkey validation for my friend here this is um I think he thought the tum was a bridge t p is a bridge but wow Jacob okay bro but Jacob okay I see you and then 10 second totic Jami and RC did end up and I got 11th consistently around that like 101 range you know we'll take it we will take it let's see how we did here Ione did Ukraine lot Ukraine great guest potic couple Russia couple more Western Columbia I don't know how you ever go north here congrats to people that did I'm just I know maybe it they look a little dry but yeah round three I'm the person that's West the most was it like did I underestimate how green it was or something I mean yeah it's pretty green I proba went a little more East it's fine and then Finland yeah yeah I think it f here but I went super South unlucky and then Netherlands everyone a lot people getting NE here there Blinky getting five Kodiak getting his first I think yep and then trctor getting his first on 30 40 second as well and then totic getting seven Jami getting five and RC

right we're back and it's another day of some gas here it's another good day to use your Noggin and I'm about to pop off you want to ask why they answer to that question is because I just listen to Jack Johnson song therefore I'm gonna pop off book area trly Northern Bulgaria um second note just got back from the dentist I can't F the whole left side of my face if I have a speech impediment blame it on my numb face call me Lincoln Park that way I be numb [Music] also okay this Palm looks like samatra but like nothing else really does this trees feel like somatra they feel like is it ever Su wesy no it's probably just a weird like where in SRA do I go south Suma ever sure I mean what are you guys gonna say it's the Jack Johnson it's the Jack it's a Double J JJ listen lock in I've done this before I've had some good guesses and I fumbled oh Lord I mean this is a force okay so the big question here is I hope it don't go I mean it's Europe it's Scandinavia or it's like Norway no it's just like Sweden Finland Baltic or Russia it's like one of these five options I don't think it's Finland I think it might be more Russian but I don't really like Russia here like it doesn't really feel Russian to me but I think and then all these little nerves are look at the copyright do I go Baltic here ever I think I have to go like Western Russia and HED no it looks weird is it ever Poland there Lithuania I'm going to slay my desk I'm not going to slay my desk cuz I'm a civil functioning member of society Scotland where you go ni again you might go a similar region up here in Ni honestly bro there's mountains South like that ever I mean it could be Scotland or something but I don't know what these could just be somewh in Ireland but this is my best guess I kind of why did I not go Lithuania I said it's probably more likely to be Lithuania I should just go Baltic why did I do that Deval I'm just not gonna if it's not it's just whatever dude I don't even care this round this round tilted me this round tilted me dude I have I have to bring some better energy into this I mean two two guesses I go I go Lavia here I mean it looked more it doesn't not look like La also there was a comment last time it was like downtown like Estonia and the commenter was like dude I've driven every road and I lived in Estonia for like my entire life and that was the most obvious no it wasn't I've seen more Estonia roads than you have no it hasn't no it no it wasn't that that location looked nothing like Estonia bro I do not want to hear the correction and the comment that this looks like a l Lithuania no it doesn't okay it doesn't it doesn't it just doesn't look like it just doesn't look like Lithuania it's an atypical Lithuania and that's okay now that's a cope you can put that one in the cope counter okay that one counts yeah I mean I didn't think it was Russia but whatever all right put that one down I feel like that's I feel like that's two days in a row that I'm gonna lose on Russia which is kind of unfortunate but like whatever such his life I guess let's do the 10-c now and hopefully we can get leaderboard in at least one day because I do not think that's a top 10 de Vu lock in this fence looks American bro lock in it looks like I I mean I yeah lock in lock in bro lock in this is Russia bro okay y Cuts how what do you go on the western roads or you going Eastern roads I'm going on the western roads over here if it's eastern roads wait what was it was I close I accidentally didn't see oh no I don't know if I was close or not surely go South Peninsula here right my score is kind of bad though I don't think I was Clos I'll check after this I forgot to guess dude there's no way there's no way I did that I was gonna I was gonna get the 5K on that no way [Music] bro oh bro I have to act I'm not mad I don't know what this is oh my God Jack Johnson have we ever have we ever seen a bigger Fall From Grace I forgot to guess on the last two rounds bro I forgot to guess in the last two rounds this is a crazy turkey though by the way this is a crazy turkey by the way I mean I notic the Chevron last second uh but I don't know where I was was going that's a crazy turkey oh man I can't even I can't even be upset I can't I mean I knew that guys can you can I can you guys at least give me like four five 4 4,500 points I would have gone like I actually I'm actually like I know like I'm I'm not like I don't know that actually like it actually upsets me you guys don't understand like I'm a competitive person that legitimately upsets me I'll smile through the pain but just understand that that right there ruined my night I'm not kidding I will have a hard time eating night because of this I will unironically think about this for the rest of the night the rest of the night maybe may even the morning why is this like either like turkey border or north and I'm not sure which I feel like this might be North actually I'm going to go here not bad a lot of people got it ooh actually kind of difficult though I don't initially know where we are I mean it kind of looks like Malaysia but I just can't think where in Malaysia this would be you know so maybe it's more likely to just be Sumatra I was thinking maybe South Sumatra with the the Red Dirt could even be banka so we could Hedge for bunka here but uh we have a little pipe which is a real matter so I might just hedge it like kind of north south Sumatra and it was South Sumatra nice now these trees are not American so that's good at least and I'm looking desperately for copyright right now I don't see any we might have to do this the oldfashioned way Tom close your eyes 23 okay nice so probably not Finland then I would say it is probably it's not a pleasant round you know it kind of looks more like Finland but yeah I'm just going to go Southeast Sweden I don't even love this guess I don't know where this is gu just doesn't like it's just like wow you ever go to Baltic on that bro how you want me to go Baltic on that maybe this is actually the ni stuff again or the IR Irish stuff again but we have had so many Pine Forest rounds in the last three days uh this time no this time I am am I thinking maybe it could actually just be in that same place we have have Hills kind of Southwest that can make sense if we were like here yeah finally we have the big window car in Philippines so I'm going to have to make a really nice one and hedge everything go mpat I like mpat here that's a good guess oh still not enough to the top I had to go Baltic all right so it's technically the next day but it's like 1:00 a.m. but I'm blurred let's see how everyone did it's it's it's not giving those people amount of time to fully play the seed so I'm playing this at a point where I'm not goingon I'll re I'll I'll go and actually do in the scores at another point because not everyone has had an opportunity to play yet but there's enough people to get a general idea of like I'll update you guys the next day on uh who got points all right everyone g b Cara solid round two uh the Suma guess shout out to was it tra yeah I mean TR got 20 29 on this kind of crazy lot people going Indo a couple Malay and a couple kambo Donis based round three dude trabot is kind of the goat trod uh couple Russia guesses only three four lithu or Balta guessers couple us and some Sweden or like Finland Sweden the ni you already know the Vibes up there Northern Ireland couple Scottish things like that and then the Philly guess yeah I just went South cuz Pals kind of should click Center but whatever not too bad so far trota Buzzy and aan we got two new zealanders up in the top here and then uh Singapore so pretty cool traboa Loki popped off in this seed though it's gonna be pretty unbeatable to beat but Buzzy is right right there too though we'll see and then the 10-sec one trior to no surprise I got 13th here so far wait how did I get 13 I forgot to guess the last two rounds how does that happen bro wait what I kind of did not do that bad I could have gotten like an easy 20K here which would have only brought me to eighth but not sure how this happened oh that's how that happened okay all right yeah the US lots of people get New Mexico the fence everything like that I had a great rushia gu that's probably why only me and trick are getting Nova Nova there going Omsk some Western Russia although yakuts gu yakuts guesses you guys don't know the fire coverage is more Comm up here Blinky Tri or Blinky trior and zigzag in the road a lot of people going kind of in the same region all valid round four what happened oh this is me trying to get to Southern Thailand I called you guys I did call it okay r five the turkey yeah I fumbled I mean I still somehow got 13 there so far with without two guesses so all right I'm not going to do the score sheet but I'll see you guys uh tomorrow I I don't know what the format's going to be like for tomorrow's video as you guys see because I'll be in Rong I'll bring a laptop maybe I'll play it there we'll see but um I'll I'll keep you guys updated and um I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations":

right we're back and it's another day of s hopefully everyone is ready hopefully everyone is ready to have a good day of using your Noggin this is one of these roads North Sri Lanka that maybe no I don't know hedging somewhere up here oh dude what how is there water South there it just wasn't mapped whatever bro whats okay round two oh interesting what is this I don't know if you guys my webcam might be covering that looks like it's like oh wait no this is Russia cuz there's concrete on the bottom of these pols here which makes me think it's like is that water Northwest in between these Hills I mean we're like somewhere wait is it somewhere over here then I guess I don't really know we're like up here more M something I don't know guys oh nice guess okay it was just one of these roads I saw the water in the trees and that's why I gued by the Lakes over here so we'll take that let's not choke this away here all right so immediately these okay it's flat and this house looks French we have a looks Bel it could be Belgian it could be Denmark H I don't like that this house isn't really look Danish so it was a problem it's like brick and I don't really feel like that looks Danish we have a windmill and it's flat so I might go Belgium France 50/50 because I can see this brick house this architecture right here being French and the road doesn't really scream that dang to me could it ever be a Netherlands that does house doesn't really look Dutch either if you go Belgium and it's Netherlands and it's not a bad guess anyways so I might go like somewhere along the France border here Poland wasn't even an option in my head yeah pull makes sense this house looked like brick yeah no ice misread that house a lot God dang it dude wait what was the exact POV again give me four guesses I go Poland here I think or maybe if I just think on a little bit harder I kind of I was pretty confident on the France Belgium though to be honest like candidly like this house just looked like such brick distance the roads is weird though the roads look really weird I guess for France is this North Poland it's not even North po why is there windmill there bro like what are you doing there bro like [ __ ] dude get a life go windmill somewhere else man and what is this you guys already you guys already embarrassed me once like why do you want to do it again bro I'm just trying to upload a YouTube video for my friends I mean where do you where do you possibly go here bro I don't even know where to even start I mean it's Europe and I guess you go Italy Spain Corsica maybe France I guess I just go Italy dud I don't know like what this could Poss I don't know man I'm really I lost words on this guess you go somewhere Italy it's going be Spain or some France it could be pyes France like over just Northern Italy why I go southern Italy dude I swear bro I swear if I go if I go in UK on Ireland vice versa if I go if I go Ireland it's UK or if I go UK it's Ireland it looks more Irish to me it looks we have grass we have grass in the the road so and it's Gen 2 I have to go Ireland but if this is the UK we might have some trouble okay oh man I mean fine guesses Not Top 10 today though I don't think Not Top 10 we had a good rushia guess Italy guess pisses me off but like because people like go franer and get more points of me and this I'm just like like I should have got eventually Poland here I think this road never really looks French or Belgian I guess but what are you going to do about it why does this like lowkey like look like yeah I guess it could be North but all right whatever let's just do the 10- second hopefully I can get at least top five here I don't think I got even at least top 10 other one wipe sweat off my hands and lock in here I probably won't talk much because I'm going to try and sweat it [Music] that's already pissing me [Music] off I an itch this is never for Sweden [Music] right dude I'm playing so well besides that one guess it's just Russia that just freaks me up like [Music] this freaking Russia dude freaking Russia dude ah whatever it's just Russia this one wasn't that bad this one I mean I just guess they both looked flat and like look that like that region but great Spain call out I mean got the island right and Chile which is kind of standard but yeah it is what it is it is what it is the cop calendar to day is going to be kind of uh he's definitely goingon to be busy but that's okay let's um solid not I didn't have any two major blunders but messed up a little but let's see how let's see how everyone else does if we have Sri Lanka I always screw up the region on Sri Lanka these days it kind of feels like there's quite a bit happening both sides of I'm a h in like this uh well it's just nor stuff yeah if it's Russia I think M good close enough it's good there's not much to go off of here this is very generic I don't know if those buildings even look polish they kind of look French or something but uh I think Poland that's most likely it's also not a dirt road at all which is kind of funny well nice get could even be like Max South France I think I like Italy the best though could this be Sardinia that would be a crazy guess if I pulled that and hedge what a hedge baby let's go okay not bad I think it does feel Irish overall maybe going to an ni here getting in N no it's gen two great let's see well let's go that was a good guess all right not Indo not Tai not anything of the sorts we go for a central hedge this massive 200 Point loss right there it's to Brak it to you and I think it's Archangel I don't know how far north so I'm going to just put it in a middle over here no it's more mon actually looks like Poland this is like your standard sort of uh good gosh T yeah close enough oh dear um um my first time was Italy this is interesting like this gravel yeah I mean that looks quite Italian I would say I'm not sure where cuz I I almost thought the Alves but I don't want to go in Alves I'm just going to say somewhere fairly Central like here uh okay now I would assume it's Ireland and pretty similar to where I went last time I realized after I guessed that maybe that looked more like here here than here but this is actually what this area looks like okay trust me on this one trust okay that's close enough you could have popped off with that rush I guess was good yeah unfortunately I did not okay to be fair we had plenty of rocks which is a i the water through the trees that's only reason why I went up there where are you seeing water wait go back to the POV bro that we were looking at in NPC were we not looking this way yeah yeah you don't see the water to the in the trees the water in the what yeah see it right there look dude dude where dude no no no look Northwest bro Northwest Northwest and left left up left left up there your cursor's on it bro that's Sky that's not water that's that's water do you know do you know how uh like yeah there's this thing called elevation there tell me there tell me I just randomly thought I saw water that is exactly where I was looking how is there water up here that just not how like angles work go go for I mean it is see there is water on the map but that does not mean that you were looking at water so it's just coincidental yeah the water's map and everything here bro I don't know what to tell you like it's clearly you're looking at I get what you're saying I get you're I get where you're coming from man all right it's next day um let's see how everyone did I got 16th it is probably literally just a poing guess but let's see there's 28 people that played let's see what happened con is getting first again I think this guy's played twice and he's gotten first at least both times Trona everyone gets REM everyone a lot of people do get no one I I mean I had a really good guess there how did I get 16th where where did where did they go wrong it's Poland yeah okay yeah I mean the road looks super polish so makes sense makes sense the the freaking house though the house bro it was the house cope Italy lots of people getting Italy yeah I mean Italy Greece Spain France are really the only answers there no one really going north though Lots people going south and then Ireland so this literally came down to this and then let's see I got 11th in the 10 second what happened con second here or fourth okay oh we had Omsk yeah whatever round two chil the island I think this island has cabbage it's real many guys if you see cabbage and Chile go on that island um Finland Spain cracked Spain guess dude completely on accident but I'll take it and then Russia again yeah it's just Russia Russia version guessing does this one all right so zigzag gets five bag gets eight and lley gets one also guys I do these right when I wake up in the morning the f I don't I from the moment I open my eyes to wake up 10 minutes later I'm recording freaking Excel sheets okay so yeah I mess up the Excel sheets a lot it's literally within 5 minutes of me waking up I'm doing this okay so come me some slack I'm don't even shower before I do these because I want to get these out before 11:00 a.m. or 11: p.m. and then cons get four Lenley gets two good day for Lenley lley gets two and zigzag gets six all right oh this is not right no E I need to do E I need e [ __ ] how I do e there we go all right not too bad I will see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 9.509617144211395, "lng": 80.41420896084254}, {"round": 2, "lat": 67.52013759289493, "lng": 33.319892454249896},

right we're back with another day of some jaser and today is a great day to use your Noggin round one you Sur go Ireland here right you ever go in I or somewhere like up here is it ever up here actually I think it might be I'm I'm going to do that actually I think I'm going to do that yeah because it could be Scotland sure but I like something like [Music] this dude I hope this isn't one of those videos where I'm make an insanely good guess and then I proceed to go wrong continent and ruin my chances of Ever Getting first place in this game that would never be the case hopefully this is Sri Lanka right it's never Thailand right dude I'm overthinking everything now this pull I don't think I think that I swear to God okay wait dude I'm lowkey getting a really good score right now do not choke this okay okay France or should be France right or Spain oh no I mean the houses look more Spanish or is ever Portugal got to go Spain here some like Southern ever shutters we have shutters is it ever like it could be Portugal dude I don't know what I'm doing I'm going Spain like near France just in case it's France I don't want to choke this it was Portugal but I went Spain so it's okay this is try W I can't believe I choked it oh it's such an me off here okay not the round I wanted is this Russia or like Baltic this would be the craziest Baltic in my life Sur just Russia right there's like that that Pole right there I don't know Russia like that though bro like at all this is never Baltic right dude why do have to make a good guess and just throw it all away Story of My Life K me yeah I don't know what this is guys I'm be honest this is just a massive skill issue I'm gonna hedge near btics because I think it looks okay that could have been worse that could have been worse uh that could have been worse but the thing is I made a good guess in the country that everyone gets 4,900 points anyways because it goes to Ireland and they get 4600 points so it's like oh congrats you get you great an amazing guess that you get 200 points for why can't why can't I make an insane guess on Russia you know why does it have to be on a small ass country why do I have to proceed to then go Port Spain on Portugal I don't know if this is a thing but I feel like colored facades are like yeah in hindsight like the roofing is more Portuguese but such as life wait can we see this pole okay you can't see the holes in it the holes in the pole or Portuguese on the wait where the holes in the pole whatever dude um I only knew this too because I saw this Ro a lot what map was I playing I was playing a map with snail and I kept getting this region of Ireland a lot and so I just kind of recognized it the trees yeah all around I mean not that bad of a day but not it's a top five 10 day let me past a seed and let me play 10 second like my life depends on it I am try Harding it's look South AF it was South AF dude what is this it's like somewhere like dude that lock in bro lock in was this Philly surely right wait palan ever wait bro why am I lowkey scripting today this looks North we have take them go was [Music] I fumbled dude someone get this guy like I mean I I did somewhat decent but and I'm blurred I mean I called the right Brazil out I don't know how that's that South to be honest maybe just a skill shoot this one I was just hedging like four different states I thought it could be this one I was hedging palan this one I thought it was North but then I was like I don't I don't know whatever so this is the top 10 too and blur so I'm going go ahead and cut it I'll see how El does uh kind of lean Ireland over Scotland here and I would go like here this classic Ross common sort of area I think yeah oh wait yeah that's the other area okay fair enough uh just a sh looks like and it kind of looks like East Coast i' would say oh wait no I'm dumb I forgot the ponds is where West CO anyways is that wait is Portuguese pole I guess it's kind of weird for Portugal not yeah I don't know I'll go here H yeah that's why it's weird for Portugal it's literally like downtown Spain okay W or I don't know those are weird No it should be BL it should be why with this um oh this is like out here I think somewhere some crazy stuff yeah wait wow that was did you get the right red you did yeah I basically pled the yeah impressive I know where it was but yeah okay and then I would assume it's Russia um I I want to say it's like Leningrad Leningrad has so many dirt roads like this okay oh I got first nice you guys context like 35 seconds ago RC comes in his Discord I'm tired and it proceeds to get 23k just alping everyone I was like and you did it really quickly too yeah yeah all right I guess I should play when I'm tired more yeah I guess so bro okay you also took me from two points to one point in that game so I hope Dam lock it no it's cool bro if anyone get three points it's it's you yep okay uh it's a weird BR I'm kind of confused maybe it's not br oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh that makes total sense I was like it's a weird VR it was a weird VR it was weird be this is like Utah maybe I don't know kind of weird oh it was it was Utah was Utah good guess there should be just a Northern Philly right just around here somewhere oo okay I see you you know how I know my feeling bro All That central Philippines we played to get you know really yeah ex Wasing P by the waym totally not uh I don't know where this will be go there I think it's West actually or no okay I just hged 5K I'm the goat uh this is just I don't know somewhere over here don't know by yeah okay fair enough yeah that first result you popped without yeah got ninth how's it ever that South in Brazil though I'm kind of confused no not that second lock [Music] yeah yeah oh I guess we have balls technically which is like usually by here more south but I didn't notice that shout to the balls yes shout out to the balls they're actually birds nests but jupa called them balls all right just with RC let's see how everyone did only 21 people played a lot of people did not finish the SE assumingly or they just not a lot of people played shout out to RC zigzag and myself couple Scotland valid this is yeah snil dude I snil knows that because of I think it was in his map but yeah bunch of people getting Ireland trees Shri Lanka I thought about Thailand for the longest time so I think some people just looked at their Roes on Sri Lanka and that's why I mean we're guessing in 5 seconds this happens thankfully I have some people Spain with me um was just border Spain but uh yeah a lot of people Portugal Spain couple France all valid all valid some Western Australia red soil RC somehow near the road zigzag over there Blinky bad making sense and then the Russia this is kind of where decid it all uh who got close Donis how did Donis do D got 14th congrats Donis okay um not a bad day not a bad day I mean I got third here and then I got first on the 10 second I'm not sure how that happened to be honest because I had a really bad Brazil guess in the final round but we'll see this is just see what happens here ah it was a southern Brazil gu that did it handful of us did get Southern Brazil here to PO with a great guess good 10 of us there couple people gting Northern Vibes too uh some Mech do look weird everyone going look at this block over here uh yeah a lot people going Utah um I went Idaho hedging Wyoming Utah Colorado and three Philly a lot of Bhutan here lots of Bhutan over there that makes sense I mean everyone went North but I'm just hedging I'm a dirty hedger bro and it paid off me Jami and Dusky uh Kenya everyone getting Kenya I mean it looked like an obvious North but I'm just bad and the Northeast Brazil dep with a great guest bag going more south but all in all pretty pretty standard and I'll take a first it's more just oh I won but like 90 points it's kind of crazy it's so close it's so close RC gets three zigzag gets two and your truly gets one and then this 10c I updated a 10c one I don't know how to make I tried making a filter wait why is it when I go to create new filter it says remove filter I don't want to do that can I just add two I don't know what I'm doing here bro okay rainbolt gets three totic gets two bag it's one to six all right bag currently in lead with six and nine nice we'll see if it's sustainable ver

right it's another day of some G and today is a great day to use our Noggin let's get 40 seconds on the clock a dirty world only dirt roads can we have a good day today the answer is yes we can this looks like a guat car car blur does anything else here look guat no what else could it be though the box shape here looks guat and I kind of want to go near Mexico though because it feels like it's be near Mexico I don't want to go up here um so go something like this I don't even know where coverage really is in gu I'm being honest but uh yeah that's my best bet I'm not sure what else this could be it was near Mexico just I picked the wrong border but we'll take it oh okay now we're going to we're going to cook here we're going to cook here some hills in the back in Brazil red ass soil I want to go south but not too South it could be like mgds I like an mgds with how green maybe but maybe a Goos Mao something like this over here I think is good I don't know maybe near Salo something like this oh not Paraguay you still use where am I oh man breaking for a map yeah GDs like this down here I think it's good it's Goos but you know that's that's fine that's fine 4100 lock in Dirt Road number three is is among us sussy all right looks like we're driving right I mean this one's interesting the obvious answers are France Netherlands UK I would say maybe even in the UK I think I have to go France though because it looks like this car is coming from the right so I'm going go I'm going to go do I ever go like here no I'm going to go France hopefully it's right oh wow that water guess would have been really good but you know all things ised not a bad day so far okay this should be Mexico Sun South Northern Hemisphere looks Mexico to me it looks like northern Mexico let's see if we can line up something here we have Hills over here I don't think they're the mon Hills but we should go somewhat I think near Mont I kind of go more West it's pretty dry though never Baja right I don't think it's ever B I'm gonna go is it Baja I'm going Baja here actually no I shouldn't go Baja here I would see cacti or something I go somewhere like over here cha was Monteray all right and this is going to be somatra surely right is a pole not sure what that pole is it looks these look like some manra or like reality jomes something over here the S dish is also facing super up which means we're near the equator so something like this would make sense um dream taught me that I don't know if it's ever useful but maybe in this round it is so I'm going guess along the here and it was on the equator wow dreams lowy the goat okay 211 bad guesses today included Mexico I think the rest are pretty standard pretty standard seed all around um West suuma oh oh it was there okay solid mgds I mean yeah it's it's one of those things where it's a top 10 but I don't really know how it's everyone's gonna do because you can pick up points in Mexico things like that and there's small points you can pick up here and there but we'll see I just never realized I for turn lights on so hopefully this this lighting is better also I'm counting the 10c rounds now as like leaderboard so I need to try hard I'll probably update I for I keep forgetting I'll probably update this is beautiful where this is beautiful I want to go here I'm assuming it's up here somewhere wow it's KZ Cancun that is I almost went Brazil Northern Brazil there but GRE island ever I'm hedging a bunch of islands here technically yes who is ever going on that island someone that clicks like Athens gets closer I'm GNA I'm going to scream and shout and let it all out scream and shout how's it ever if this is not Finland all right not that good of a day not that I I'm gonna be honest guys this round you guys saw me probably get there pretty late I for some dude for some odd reason for like the first three seconds I thought this was Kyan because of the I looked like there was like a car blur I know cringe and I just clicked on like big mountains over here that uh I know there were but yeah I guess it makes sense it's this far south but I mean we got all the countries right so this this gu pisses me off how's it ever that Island like I guess it makes sense but like H and cre bunch of rain SM Islands but all right all things here not a bad day could have gone better but also it could have gone worse so glass half full and let's see how um everyone else does all right it's the next day and unfortunately on days where I have tournaments it's harder for me to record with other players so a little bit of a shorter video today I'm sorry it's just me um but listen see how we did we got 10th top 10 like I said I think it's top 10 also bag was like it's like this is like three days in a row now he's gotten like first or something with 25 seconds played in the entire seed and he went how did he get first going there okay he somehow 5K New Mex or Mexico 8 seconds he knew the road in guat in 5 seconds sent Goos and got Wester okay okay bro Jake getting second consus decides to play and gets third place love to see that welcome consus let's get everyone in here 31 people man dirty worlds is bringing out the all my friends today dirty world is bringing out all my friends all right do this quickly gu two people knew the road to bag and Jacob not sure how I have some good company up here but couple people going Mexico a couple people going uh Indo but yeah the car some Goos guesses some mgds guesses with me down here V great guess um yeah everyone getting Brazil though it's always a good sign this was the France wait only four people five people got France where did I lose my points at what happened oh Mexico dude that tilts me tilts me so much CU I literally the first thing I did when I loaded in I was like a it's monter I should have just gone with it oops Yeah Whatever bag somehow got the road in 8 seconds blinkie getting very very close there along with some other friends and then the Endo a lot people going west monra that must have been a Westra Pole or something that I um I missed I don't know that many PS in Indonesia but maybe it's also coming on Su Wy or something because a l people also went sua so don't know they just looked like some MRA to mebe because of the palms and con playing his first ever seed and getting first place on 10 seconds you love to see it you love to see it couple timeouts here couple people confused in round one what was round one I've been round one oh with this yeah the Yucatan bag got the right Road in 9 seconds well I guess it's playing 10 seconds so it's that's fair but yeah Conant is getting everyone a lot of people get yukatan couple in Brazil couple Indo yeah I mean a lot people timed out on this one because they probably didn't know where to yes that's valid as well um Greece we had the wooden poles with the lamps so no one getting the island right couple island guessers with me over here You' love to see some Island guessers just the wrong Island Mainland enjoyers and shambles okay the arge yeah I probably went a little too north but I was in C for half the round on accident so it took me a second to get back to gry and can't really raise your guess in time anyone get close in this is that M's your profile picture yeah shout to ma great guess um some Slovakia enjoyers you love to see it I mean just check his Sakia 5050 is and then Finland Gen 2 all right bag getting nine points dude this might be over quick guys this might be over quick Jake getting two and consis getting one and then I'll

right we're back with another day of some J guys here and today is a great day to use our nogin wait that's like a dragonfly or something that's kind of sick what is this is this Yucatan yucatan's my best guess immediately this road fills uke wait this is sick you can see the splash of the water right here from the car wait this is really cool and dragonfly that's such a cool location okay what else could it be driving right presumably yeah I think should be just youan I go somewhere calish get as many points as we can it was super North I mean it was super Sandy so something like that does make sense in hindsight round two okay should be obviously is this red car I think it's red car I don't know if Norway has red Gen 4 and that's going to be a skill issue if I go and I go wrong country because of a car color and nothing you know veget around us but I think I mean I me I thought was it was Norway but like it looks like it's like a SK or like a Sweden car cringe I know but like other way like I still get get points here so I'm going go somewhere like up here somewhere like this maybe makes sense we'll see hopefully it's it's good it was just Stockholm it was red car and we're not losing that many points so it's okay I mean white painted brick with a Pro pole I than you honestly bro I think you click outside Lima I really do I'm not sure what else you could do here because I'm too scared to commit anything else because it's always just outside Lima it feels like I'm going to go somewhere like down in these Hills down here it's going to be in this western part of Pur though I don't see being that far south though quite is the problem hope this doesn't age wrong out Lima okay okay it's Noggin time because what the heck is this oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh Lord oh Lord have mercy to my soul Mexico my best bet I don't know what I don't know what it could be I don't know what this is guys I really don't I can only think of ever the only thing I can think of is Mexico here like I can't think of anything else Happ sense I'm go some in like V [Music] Cru it's a great guess just all around just a pat on the back for that one and if we go into round five and we choke it so be it but I'm proud of that dude this Pole looks black and yellow it looks like it's like dirty but like if I just going go here and hedge it just in case wait it's never like yeah it's never like K or anything surely oh it's eswa really that makes sense actually just rustic that's a that's a cool s that's a very yeah it's actually it looks as what in hindsight I was Hing Gabon though because I thought this could be yeah I don't know I don't know what I was doing there not sure what I was doing there my mind got too uh fixated on thinking that this like dirt was like a deal in Black pull in Bots but but it was just uh that's but I'm not losing that many points 216 all around I really could have I can't believe I choked it like that bro I can't believe I choked it like that that's actually an alltime choke like that that's actually just like 739 behavior all right that's that's fine it's fine let's make sure I'm recording because I'm start a single player I actually play a seat earlier and wasn't recording let me copy paste that link I cannot believe I missed I went yeah whatever oh 10 seconds what is this they were taian take it you go BC or California or something you go you go like Somewhere In Like Us Colorado wait I just popped off on accident I tried switching dude if I screw this up surely it's per right it's anything else right guys it's everything else right guys it's never BL or anything else right guys it's never Columbia right guys oh my God I almost heart attack if I didn't get get there in time this looks weird like this looks like one of these Eastern roads in Cambodia like this H it's Western Road dude I'm just a choke artist dude I'm just a choke artist man just a choke artist that's all I ever be the story of my life is making like one good guess and just acts like I mean this is such an obvious Colo I just got too nervous I'm just not that guy oh my God I D that just reminds me of this of that video I saw dude I have to I I have to show you guys this I'm going to blur everything around here so it doesn't show like who this uploaded this but this guy keeps uploading playing these daily challenges but he doesn't realize that it's the most obvious thing ever that he's cheating because he keeps forgetting the rounds and clicking the wrong one like watch watch watch just watch this guys I'll toxit watch okay so he's zooming in he forgot what the round was this is just North Macedonia and he goes Indonesia on it because he forgot the round but watch just keep watching Philly okay he's going to get the Philly he's just the goat absolute go look at this look at this boom great guess oh interesting okay oh immediately knowing where it is zooming in North Carolina let's check yeah these trees make sense yep yep free account by the way less than 20 games played by the way okay oh I think it could be somewhere over here near yeah I think something like this makes sense let's see oh wow great guess just outside Springdale he's the goat Malaysia you go Mainland I think you go north Mainland is what this looks like here yeah oh final round what could it be the Endo round exactly where he clicked last time if you're going to cheat at least remember five rounds brw and the crazy thing is it has happened more than once he can't remember more than five locations I can't tell if this is satire or not I I I I physically can't tell if this a satire or not okay so he's the goat on knowing uh oh it went Minnesota you know it's fine you know North Dakota goat next round okay what is this what could this possibly be dirt road I'm feeling over here like this North Region of Peru it's Argentina but wait guys wait till you see it oh he's a goat in Canada he knows he knows he just knows he's just a goat no Scotia it's okay Ghana standard Ghana just go just go kamasi Ling yep it's easy road to know he he knows the road he knows the 5K wait for this it's a freaking perer round that he thought it was earlier because he can't [ __ ] recognize what looks like even when he's cheating like oh my God bro he's the actual goat the actual goat fcking bro okay a crazy flooded location this is actually kind of cool um it's like mosquitoes or something dragonflies Mexico Yucatan I don't I don't [ __ ] know this is uh interesting one where's the C oh is it maybe a oh it's a weird blur is it it's a guat I've never seen a r like this in no I don't know okay is you dud you scare me bro you actually scare me did you see the blur I did I did I think it was just because it was turning there something I don't know yeah I mean I did not know of any I don't think there's any road that looks like that in Quad so okay we have red car trying to think how far north or south I want to go I would say it's pretty South so I'm going to say it's like down here no it's just down to sool that makes sense CR it's all right it's all right um Peru I cook these if I think of it it looks kind of Northern my goodness I don't know I don't like this but I'm going to go here it's not right what is it oh it's okay juano ah see I knew it wasn't Coastal but I I mean that's tough one dude what are these rounds yeah I don't even know what content this is Mex I don't know or Cruz like a over here okay okay there we go so what we like to see Max has been tricky but I've gone it I swear if you script to beat me in this final round I threw the final round so hold on let me let me cook this let me cck this why don't we see the rich to South that's the weird part for St stop where bro just stop just let me have my moment for once please it's going to be like men seniors I actually okay but I clicked middle I clicked middle I went Z on that so that's fine I just th that yeah was I was beating you anywhere in s really yeah here but I'm not going there all right it's the next day and bag got first place in 30 seconds okay bro came in 10th where did that blunder on this one I forgot already L people playing today this is kind of insane i' been saying lots of how many people play 30 wow um where did I do okay we see okay round one you a lot of people get everyone get mexic for the most part that's good round two red car Sweden no one just clicks Stockholm uh jhk getting really close with the water hedge there impressive yeah most be getting Sweden uh Peru click Lima standard this was a fun one GC RC myself JK a lot of people getting imp Cruise Mexico in general we have a couple guacs of the car us Colo and lots of Southeast Asia which does make sense as well I thought about D I thought about Borneo for the longest time dude I really did oh this is where I blundered ah I'm glad I have some other my some friends over here and uh Gabon but and some South Africa guys here but a lot of people do with there just a skill Sho on my end honestly just a skill shoot still got 10th though so we'll take that all right and then 10 second yeah I don't expect to do well oh I got six place with going Colo on or per on Colo that's kind of impressive and only 24 people finish this seed so that's uh encouraging okay Taiwan a lot of people think it Taiwan Ando Japan makes sense um probably some people timed out probably getting Taiwan shout out to Anis for getting Taiwan this was a good Montana guess on accident to be honest but couple BC couple Colorado Wyoming makes sense RC and Chumley that shle do 15 good job shley couple people Pro with me though that's validating zag totic Blinky four Petoria I get I almost want to go CA here so valid guesses honestly I was so close to going Canada and they around five the Cambo yep [ __ ] cam I assumed a lot of people would goia but I'm over here alone in the Eastern Road but that's okay shout to the people that got the west west Vibes there bag getting six CG getting CG getting two and GC getting one bag is off to the dominant start with a total combined time of 45 seconds see let's see uh let's see how he does tomorrow and I will see you guys

right we're back with another day of smer and today is a good day to use your Noggin we're on a new map dirty World a map that only puts you on dirt roads round one where the hell are we don't know you guys might see a record amount of coke today I want to go Mexico here dude oh my God this map is so hard I I forgot how hard this map was okay so we're in the northern hemisphere we have trash on the side of the road honestly like Mexico or Spain were my only two options here in my head like vegetation wise this this map is so I'm go [Music] Mexico lock in great guess great guess let's seeu we will take freebies in today's in in this economy we will take freebies guys I'm guys I'm not kidding I'm trying to come out of this winning okay I want to win this season okay I'm I'm locked in I'm sweating I'm I'm trying everything I can I'm also going to start scoring the 10 seconds so I have to sweat both of those now and I actually just got the right Road call me Victoria Justice the way I be victorious lock in that was a bar round three you have to go Sweden Southern Sweden it's never Northern Sweden it could be Northern Sweden then you go right here though we have a yellow sign which gives away the Sweden actually I think it's closer to like Norway border over here with these like rocks like this elevation on the side I still think it's South so I'm going to go somewhere over here where it could be North though I think it could be South too actually like somewhere even more [Music] south should click the first lock in oh Lord water South is ever Island Man wait am I tripping wait is this wait is no no no wait oh am I tripping I thought for for a second this could be like uh aor we have so many rock walls oh I'm tripping if I lose all my points on this because I'm trolling I don't even know if this place has coverage why did I switch away from it great guess great guess don't choke it don't choke it I wish I knew New Zealand [Music] better I mean I guess I just have to go North Island no where do I go here I don't know I don't know New Zealand enough I'm gonna go just outside Christ Church and hedge over here ah I blundered I could have won the seed I was doing so well I mean that's such a I mean that seed comes down to New Zealand bro maybe not everyone gets zor but I think they do because of the flowers God I'm actually like I'm actually sweating so hard that because I want to do well let's do a 10 second real quick let's do the 10 second let me paste that link real quick all right 10 seconds on the clock this should be Scotland surely whs suck my nuts it's never Peru right you just go arge never Peru this map sucks this map is so hard bro it's so fun though where is this bro just coloriz I should just click the first French should be France yeah close my eyes close my eyes close my eyes close my [Music] eyes could be better okay yeah the 20 the the uh 402 went better I could have got the Peru I think I might even said watch this be Peru I think it might be Peru yeah it's a clear Peru it's a clear Peru skill shoe quite the skill shoe all right it was a fun day though this map will create a lot more cat moments and I might sweat too much in this so if I if I get too sweaty let me know guys um but or if I'm not talking enough because I'm too focused on thinking about the lock let me know I'm trying to you know it's hard to do both at the same time but um yeah let's see we'll see how other people do but this is going to be an interesting season to say the least there see let's go I'm need to lock in we'll do we Mexico we have the yawns this is not good yeah I mean you're so up but whatever did you have your raspberry poptart no I didn't Fu okay lock in lock in sorry guess 21 I don't know um yeah I was thinking Mexico I don't really know what else could be I don't think it's Arch St Louis P I think yeah do like here okay atis do I know the road no why are we going north that's kind of weird he just clicked the 5 sorry I I'm trying to like actually try this is this is do or die I mean low key would be here but I don't know bro you just clicked off the 5K that's kind of sad I did that is yeah right here bro not the best region guesses for me today but it's all right it's okay man at least I'll getus here I think it's this one could it be this one could be this one [ __ ] you like my guess without coverage yeah the one without coverage I checked it after but yeah this is let's see so this Ro is no um Northeast sort of heading yeah I think it's this there we go okay wait wait zoom in did we just get the 5K yeah I just got the 5K that was that was some Slight Work did I mean got not only that was like not only a 5k that was like wait dude did you actually script at last second you beat me by 90 points that was could you make the script less obvious next time you decide to R 5K a road to New Zealand to beat me like what the you can't make I mean I don't I mean dude you know what that it reminds me of that one snow coverage that you remember the aloc qual guess in turkey that road yeah that someone thought it was that one Road in turkey or in New Zealand yeah is that where that road is that New Zealand yeah that's that's where that is yeah I thought that for a second all over here it's on the 85 and then I think it goes down on the 87 as well I remember that road I just couldn't remember where it where it was okay yeah listen bro we're have to have a talk about that that was kind just disrespectful honestly just got just got to know the snow coverage hey now I do that's why we play these right that's why we play them we live in we learn so okay whales fine yeah Peru I can't even [ __ ] reach Peru in time that was a tough one okay I have never seen this road in my life or see when it's a random White Road in R of Peru yeah pretty much what is this it looks like Wyoming but I can't place it anywhere okay interesting I've also never seen that tiny ass white Road in my life you're in first place though somehow okay France it just looks like a western sort of house kind of go there okay Northern Polo let him cook there's no going dude yeah it was just bogot of course it was I overthought it last second bro ah yeah I mean you want these hands I do you're about to get 8008 wait they show why are they exposing me like that bro what the heck dude I haven't I haven't played cop in like two three years bro why is it hey you're about to lose ELO bro I hate to break it to you you're going die apparently apparently the the video of like the kid at the fair well apparently like back bro is this here or like here basically guess what I'm clicking right now here or here what two countries am I clicking Croatia or Greece I don't know C Monte was a free it's never never Monty yeah I know that's why I got more points than you bu it's an awful lot of bamboo that's awful lot hot C coffee pot this IND Philly bro or Thailand no it's not Thailand doing [Music] this all right cut that cut that cut that delete the Del the delete the like like we both made bad guesses technically so it's like why do I get like I mean if I like I saw it I was like if this is Philly it's north for sure it was North that's such a cope why is this like so green I feel like it's going to be like downtown like Durban okay downtown you're lucky that you lost those 23 points that's going to be pivotal and the game's coming up a it's wild what what's wild about it I and I guess it's w but it's like crazy I don't know okay dude there's no way bro nowh [ __ ] it had to be like middle of nowhere that's an awful hot coffee pot I've never heard that before Eminem no I'm not much of an Eminem L but that makes sense I troll yeah um maybe oh wait I didn't guess okay SCH that makes more sense no that's a victory Royale for your homie that's GG's RC no contest take your ELO and run you know you know we like to call people like you right what free low keep going 1.6 and we're like 818 right all one more game one more game we back we back you see I cook on things so you I don't know bro okay let me let me actually cook this this is here oh dude it's back that was my other thought no way he cooks this really no I mean you do but I'm just coping no I actually don't know it's my best guess though could be more W there could be like this I think I'm trying to find the 5K web or something am I tripping it's more North okay I thought it was like St George that that one time I said it looks like guard of the Gods and it looked absolutely nothing like guard of gods but it near guard of the Gods I forgot about that what is this I don't know you tell me I I was hoping you would tell me no I'm good isn't it crazy the sun's North uh very [Music] crazy that was aggressive right bro you didn't even get the country right oh no unlucky you have to remove that USA flag bro dude I hate like rural Europe on this map dude it's 2023 copyright thoughts I'm at it's

people got 24K congrats um gelous that's my freaking teammate everyone a lot of people get Mexico there people going South America Europe Africa everyone getting luu that's a good look for us Lenley getting uh a very good score there that's promising what was this one Sweden the yellow sign South a couple more people nor North but that's okay I Toro made my heart I said it could have been no but the flowers there and guys I went on an island with no coverage I know I [ __ ] up I've honestly never looked at coverage maps because honestly looking at coverage maps is kind of cringe okay and this one was South Island and like this is the one where like I knew there's snow covers somewhere in the South but I forgot where it was but it was just that road the RC and Linley both 5K so Linley had a couple really good games really good rounds but it looks like he might have missed a country or something and kind of hurt him all right in the 10-sec one I completely blundered on so let's see yeah this was a bad look for your boy it was a AR Peru round the only thing that really messed up on I would say personally round one yeah Bing Wells yeah a couple people down south of me though I always just went way too South but a lot of people actually did end I'm going Argentina here but lots of people did go PR as well uh Colorado there is Utah yeah interesting four French polls five Blinky getting Germany on France bro I'm just kidding just click Capital yeah pretty standard day but um a good nonetheless zigzag getting three Lous getting three and Jami getting one let see if I can remember how to do this for you guys real quick God it' be so easy to troll right now I actually forgot how to do it [ __ ] I actually forgot how to do it this is not a good look crate filter that's

I mean obviously it's O but like where the heck do you go in Australia here bro do you ever go Tas Mania I think I might go Taz could be sa I like Taz though honestly like by a lake over here maybe any of these Lakes ever what else could it be I think I think it's just Taz was just Taz Oh that wasn't that was just a lake North though I could see Loki someone getting that right I mean it's not like there's that many lakes in Tasmania right guys like just kidding all right off take good start so far surely this is just like surely this is just New Brunswick right never taking the time to learn new Ron with nov Scotia polls um is it ever Pei okay I have a crazy shout I actually don't really know much about Pei besides red soil and hear me out Pei loves to mow the side of their roads really well like Pei roads side of the roads are always mowe really well therefore mode grass equals Pei equals this road right here it's a real meta mode grass is Pei mow your grass learner grass let's go next round why do I think why is this weird bro why do I go wrong continent here oh Lord AI gen and NPC is ly kind of tough sometimes okay this what we're thinking out loud here Israel turkey South Africa only be no Israel turkey some random European country I guess I go Israel here Greece ever Italy I don't know guys I'll go like North that's a bad luck a really bad look I mean the reason why I said grease last second was because of this wooden pole and I guess I couldn't really think of anything else that makes sense yeah listen oh there's also a yellow plate there that could have been some I mean obviously bots in South Africa has yellow plates but yeah this is a very this is a very Gable bot swana and I was diagnosed with skill shoot earlier today so that's unfortunately why I got this wrong but listen I take it on the chin and I move on with my day move on with my day you can't win them all this is a map and this is the reason why this is such a poop map okay I'm done coping dude I'm gonna get the wrong region here aren't I listen guys it's Brazil I think yeah should be Brazil here but like wait it's not Kenya is it I don't know what I'm doing wait bro that's like the hardest album cover of all time that's like the hardest album cover of all time I just had realization I'm gonna be honest with you guys two two realizations I'm bad this map sucks mainly I'm bad is it more more of a realization I had here um dude this is so hard bro bro that is such a tough photo like actually like insanely tough I started strong started strong started strong man all right since unclock let's focus up and lock in here listen that game that game doesn't you know it's okay to have bad games right cope that surely sure ah some I think because of the rubber tree I was on the 5K see this is a lock this is tell me this doesn't look like the boss w a lot guys like am I coping that hard tell me this doesn't look like the same vegetation like right near Santiago me go somewhere like I don't know all right whatever whatever man it's a good day okay yeah I fumbled I I I fumbled couple rounds [Music] okay Tasmania just slam it multiple times you know um why is it swampy that's kind of weird I feel like it's a lake or something I don't think it's the like this are is Loki swamp you know I don't know I know it was Lake uh surely Pi is the most red soil I've ever seen yeah and I mean I think everything checks out I think they have these poles so just go for a middle okay lock in RC lock in okay lock in I'm locked in is this such an easy bot SW in hindsight now I'm looking at it dude why did I think bwana and also turkey wait where's the sun sun is looking North I think it is bana or am I crazy am I actually crazy maybe I'm crazy I don't know okay it was Franc town but at least I got bana Lo Russia very Sandy I mean arang gel it feels kind of wrong for the coverage I think I'll stick with the ciruit just go downtown I think okay that's fine that's fine no surely right surely it's G uh dirt road very interesting doesn't really look like the Northeast covers but I can't think of another dirt red defs I hope I'm not wrong country but I just thought of Ghana and I thought like here I guess nope it was mexic okay like what is bag actually doing I mean I'm definitely not going yukatan there ever all right everyone get Australia lot people going Taz not really sure El would makes sense there a lot of people getting Pei couple people heading Nova Scotia and Pei getting a good point still everyone getting Canada though no one in Europe with me lots of Francis Town guesses here yeah like in hindsight looking at that round again like yeah that's pretty clear um Botswana but listen hindsight's 2020 lots of people going s because of the sand and then yeah this Mexico guest bro finish the SE in 35 seconds to got first place I mean that's just standard bag things he's the goat but yeah I mean we had Kenya lots of Ghana lots of Brazil lots of Bolivia Peru nipped aan and back getting Mexico Phil or Cambodia yeah all right this one 10 second I got 10th I'm not kidding when I said that this map ruin my night last night guys like I L I was almost like I was actually sad lot Philly Thailand Northern mountains Israel so pretty to see Chile and then just B all right bag getting three points totic getting two and gous getting one it's already sorted that's good I see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 60.161584076993535, "lng": 64.76305511235186}, {"round": 2, "lat": 18.677279081769207, "lng":

right we're back with another day of some Geer let's lock in user Noggin and make some good guesses this feels North Island should just be like somewhere Central North Island I feel something like this West this looks like Paraguay border could this be uay no it looks like it's Paraguay border Let's Line it right up no roads over there listen we're going we're going to try hard this okay I think this is getable it should be one of these white roads right East West yeah I'm gonna do something like this are you on hindsight it was getable it was getable are we back looks like we're back here this time we're not I mean not back isn't like up here but like back isn't ARG Tina like somewhere not too South but something over here near because this place this province could look scarely close to the northern provinces so I'm going to go somewhere like not too West this grid doesn't really line up I'll do somewhere over here that's a pretty good guess if I must say so it's just Mendoza but getting a pretty good guess there round four five surely this is just okay I have a meta I'm going to try and use I think this should be this road a long a here let's see if it works well let's see it curves West I don't know what I'm doing I think it should be this road this Northern Road here maybe even over here great guess I'm doing pretty well I'm doing really well can we lock in Final Round actually where did I I lost a couple points somewhere I forgot where but let's lock in here oh man is this the M8 I think there ridges on the M or east though so that doesn't make sense these are West where you get R is West you get West I don't know where you get ridges West maybe this road yeah this could make sense nice dude I kind of popped off I kind of really did well did they I mean most of these roads I think are getable I got the road right twice and then I got this one was pretty good Rion guess all things considered this one was a pretty good ring guess all things considered yeah I just blundered the New Zealand I guess is my biggest my biggest but this could be top three this could be this could be first place all things considered it's a pretty standard seed though let me paste that all right let's do 10 seconds down hopefully I do as good on the 10-c as I did the 40 second um um but we'll see maybe all my luck has ran out surely this is East uh hello hello can we do one more can I please do one more I'm doing one more that doesn't count my internet like dude this is like somewhere over here this ah all right o don't choke an O again don't choke this looks like Queensland or like North W like somewhere over here lock in tamsworth Hills I think these are Western turkey roofs I could be capping on the stack though so I go Center close enough we'll line up this is Northern Finland directly north South curv SL lay something like this maybe how is it that far south because I'm bad that's how and what is this oh wrong continent time we wrong continent time I don't know I don't know it's Indo oh that makes sense gamala if I I don't think we saw the car I was in between Mex and Indo but the dust I think was coming right that is a great location though that's a great location yeah I mean all around that wasn't that bad either I don't know how that's that far south actually I do know and like I said it's because I'm bad um great austral guess I could still win because my Mexico guess I don't I mean actually I don't think I win I think someone get gets quat and they win also I messaged the uh the the map maker of this that you heard this map and I said be honest manto man how many locks in aw are handpicked no okay so he's watching all these videos so I'm leaking our DMS um I would not have patience to handpick anything so it's just a great map that's just like generated so shout out to SL P I should do like a day where I like go through all my DMs because I just like randomly message my friends like all right okay yeah I mean honestly pretty good day all around I blundered the guat but that's fine it was kind of difficult but all in all yeah let's see how um everyone else does think North Island I'm thinking like here somewhere maybe because we have the coast over there we have a mountain North yeah something like this would work I will try that okay pretty good pretty good lock in RC lock in I would say see now I'm like uh kind of I don't know after that one uh enter Rio round I'm kind of a little worried but like I want to go like here somewhere okay yeah it was more North for mea but the landscape is crazy like where would this be I'm going to I know there's like no Road here but I'm going to head oh man wait that's I don't know that red okay I I mean how would you I don't know I think we're on this road somewhere I don't know if it's this section or like down here no it's up north oh man and then I think it's just it's a very big road I don't recognize particularly but it still looks like gu so I don't know just go middle okay yeah not too bad and you got second sad good luck you're going to need a bucko bro zoomed in I know the road bro no I'm just kiding I have no idea what I'm [ __ ] doing on no multis on something like this I just freaking instant send and he's just the goat yeah someone get this guy a map I choke by going wrong content on Forex MTI or this we had that Park on um on a round in the I think it was a 402 what are you eating poptarts oh what kind raspberry that's kind of fire you toast him yeah nice what's this I thought you told me there's a hill there what the [ __ ] is the Hill doing there I do not see a hill nice what Belgium okay that's never Belgium bro don't worry this is like one of those roads that you probably should know you know cuz like what the hell this is beautiful wait I want to go here I love Indonesia it's a great country Sam think I've seen some I watch this one guy on YouTube do hikes I feel like he did a hike over here that looked like kind of this [ __ ] I don't know where to go here unfortunate do you no but still unfortun for you this is North I mean you kind of almost have to go north don't you no I don't know you told me where's the city like dude Redemption Time free here we had a wind turbines what is this very very interesting soil makes me want to go over here yep 5K R see do you have any friends nope or back and it's next day and I got third it looks like zigzag got oh 32 people played that's a lot of people uh looks like zigzag turned his scripts on for uh the final day so shout out to him looks like we have new season Among Us Among Us Susy um let's see okay everyone going north island that's good my biggest bler there everyone kind of getting Norther and arge for the most part Argentina has people all over the place lots of people getting the right Road here makes sense but everyone getting Ghana couple people elsewhere Buzzy getting very very close everyone most people as what South Africa let you to good day pretty standard day nothing too crazy here bag did it in 37 seconds all right and for the 10c must people getting Cambo some OS guessers oops some essers lots of really close guesses there it was just T Tam worth Hills okay kind of a free meta turkey gelous unsurprisingly getting the closest there um fin thank you to all my Northern guessers here thank you cuz how the heck is that and of course tricker somehow getting on the right Road there okay bro tricker get first place in this and then guat okay yeah so couple Mi couple people saw the car there a lot of people s the car couple L Indo RC Tri Indo yeah okay also for those wondering this was the standings before RC has won both times like these were the other Seasons we did RC won with 21 points next closest was 11 and then he won with 20 points I just update it and next closest was 13 um these Maps we played these on Geo Time map so they were like much um a lot of us so all right final standings for this season also this doesn't mean this this is ending we'll just reset and do another map or the same map it depends but all right tomorrow's a new day and I'll see you guys tomorrow ",

right it's a new day and um we are on the right map today and I'm ready to use my Noggin today who is ready with me let's do this round one this looks like a little standard as about as standard as you could get for a Sweden question is how far north do you want to go I kind of want to go a little North here looks a little these trees look a little more Northern little send on the road I think this will be fine dude dude wait wait bro that might be one my best gu I've ever got I mean not really but like it has to be up there and will I follow that guess up by going Western Australia on South Australia probably but honestly whatever happens today I could care less I mean this is a really red soil okay I'm at a loss for words sure it was lucky call it luck call it whatever you want luck is when luck is when opportunity meets skill I'm going Center here like Philly pavement H just Manila okay lock in bro lock in dude what is us okay is it I mean it looks like a Vic pole with hills I mean it's a boring day but like dude I think this is a concrete pole if you guys don't know concrete poles are like mainly in Victoria I'm going to like somewhere over here Hills that was Tasmania that makes sense and then Nigeria dude I don't care that this was a free seed didn't have to use your Noggin I'm gonna go down uh can I get the city here actually it's either bin City or like one of these cities over here I I could go I'll go somewhere over here it could be Port hardcore actually but I don't care I'll play another but getting the right Road a random freaking Road in Sweden on accident is exactly how I wanted to start my day today quite literally what the hell is that okay we'll do one 10-sec game and then I'll go back and do another 40 second because that one was honestly like it's this is a sick bivan Mountain surely somewhere like that I just don't recognize just La okay Endo you go Java surely it could be Bali technically I think actually it it's just Java okay this looks like b or yeah this is Bolivia again okay oh another really easy round because you have um Norway and where it's not very many bodies of water mountains so makes it really easy okay let's do that was a fun I mean that was fine I've blundered my Indo somewhat good belivia guesses Norway okay we'll do one more 40 second game hopefully it's a little bit more difficult or you have to use your Noggin a little bit more every single country isn't kind of obvious I I would say and kind of starting off good these trees on the on the on the west here do feel Italian like this tree feel like something you would get over here like north of Rome or like at least around Rome so I'll do that I'm not saying these are Rome trees they're not Rome trees but they look like they can be around Rome and they were okay this is Tai this has to be Northern Thailand with this uh these trees right here with like how like I can't describe it but this is just Northern Thai trees for sure um yeah I I I think I should go like somewhere over here on on the and these roads are all paav too I'll go somewhere like here just ch my makes sense speaking of changai I have something changm news coming soon technically for you guys let me lock in here what is this I go Rong continent here wait this is southern hemisphere which means this is Australia or South Africa which means I probably don't go where do you get this and do I go Australia here guys I'm be honest I don't know what this is like this is I I might just go Australia somewhere over here it could be it could easily Bea oh it was south I mean that makes sense but like dude wait this is 40 seconds oh I what's I have I been playing like like it's 10 seconds I forgot I don't even know what I'm doing bro have I been playing I don't even know how I've been playing did I up already oh dude I'm actually lost I'm actually lost okay oh it's a chang my ground I did get on that one um this is pretty flat I don't know man this is deceivingly weird it's just Brazil obviously there's like I might go kind of go in the similar region like Goos uh something like this over here I think it's fine I don't think it's too north have some hills yeah I can I can I can I can understand that I can understand it for sure and then Endo probably just Java y it'll probably be Eastern Java is my best guess here Central Java um I like that seed a lot I like that seed a lot um yeah I messed up my Brazil guess granted you know that was kind of my only bad guess this one is kind of a crazy Australia in my opinion I mean it's getable for sure I can see a lot of people going South Africa here yeah I don't see everyone going uh South Australia here though but this is beautiful and uh yeah this does make sense for South Australia and it looks like somewhere I've been with Oscar actually but in hindsight wait was this Coast visible oh I didn't even think that was that I don't I did not see the water there if there was water if that was I don't remember if it was visible or not but yeah I mean I still probably would have went Southwestern Australia but I I didn't know I didn't know and then the Brazil guess yeah I don't know I don't really I guess it looked weird and for someone that knows Brazil better this is probably very easy ronia but I've never really taken the time to learn Brazil because quite frankly I don't care but speaking of changai if you guys don't know I have a Spotify and oh look at this song this is a Bas song by the way but basically I thought like I wanted to put something on Spotify and I was like listen every night before I go to bed I want to listen to like you know like the White Noise I was like dude what if I just like make like release an an EP on Spotify with like all my favorite places and sounds in Thailand that I've I've been to and so I did and it's pretty sick we got Bangkok Monsoon these are all recorded like for this you know it's it's you got the monsoon you got this Village in um changm I really like you can like hear people talking or like the birds chirping you got the farmers market hear Tai in the background this is the top of like one of the waterfalls here in Thailand it's the it's like my favorite thing ever I I I am so happy with this and then the Chang my neighborhood I love this is my favorite but yeah if anyone I'm blurred but if anyone here likes to listen to like Wyatt noise when they go to bed search Rainbow on spotif I'll put a link in the description too but I don't know it's kind of fun right I I thought it'd be fun I thought someone would out there would appreciate it this definitely feels like it would be Italy or France right with that kind of vegetation I almost thought more Italy here think I like Italy it almost like reminds me of like something that could have been in San Marino but wasn't so kind want to click Florence here click uh label yeah actually okay not bad not too shabby there Thailand uh we've been practicing uh we got lots of eucalyp here this is more of like an East Thailand thing I think yeah this kind of feels uh but we don't have that much red soil I think this is like kind of like a click here and just hope click tuck and hope I don't really get more of a Vibe than that I'm going to do that you know okay not too bad okay redeemable now though oh wait this is like fake South Africa and Australia or what I swear I've seen this before wait it's either South Africa or Australia for sure oh freak but if it's Australia it's like here T be like it's like it's it's familiar I think it's familiar I think I have to go Australia cuz it's familiar think I go here oh gosh but I play a lot of South Africa too so I might just be wrong we'll see or it could be wa even maybe okay not bad not bad uh Trident PTP this should be Rama yeah actually the uh red angles perfect rodon I mean as well uh I had you that didn't I maybe this it's kind of it kind of looks like middle of matross so maybe I click in this grid here do we see anything else we don't see much else yeah I will go in this grid here oh no I switched off oh no one else got it well it did actually look like mosso but yeah that pole top plus uh the grid okay nerd I don't initially know I think it's actually a indo wait why is it a white line I mean this should just be Indonesia but it looks quite strange wait it's it's it's surely not Bangladesh like I mean the CH the Chinese like style rice farming hat I don't I don't think it would be Bangladesh no no oh bro oh am I am I doing something crazy I think I have to go Central Java here BR I don't have enough time to work out what I actually think but I'm going Central TR there okay good bro wow we actually might win that yeah I don't think anyone beats that I mean just because of Australia guys like half people go South Africa on it alone and if you go us like I don't know it's GNA be hard to beat all right it's the next day and um let's see how we did 14th I'll be I'm like I said I'm happy with a consistent top 15 also as the time I'm recording this the video yesterday where I got that Thai City that I recognized it hit 5 ,000 likes in 24 hours I don't think I've had a video on this channel hit 5,000 likes besides one that like went like you know viral also dude my has taken zigzags first place position um like two days in R now like like that guy's gonna have beef okay so yeah my Western Australia is pretty bad but like at least I got Australia right yeah there's some zuses you know all things sinced looks like not everyone saw the water either okay let's just go round by ground uh this was the Italy had a couple yeah mediteran countries makes sense Tai yeah great CH my guesses there I wish I could describe why those trees are Northern I don't know I I suck at freaking explaining things this is the Australia Yeah couple zes here makes sense I mean I didn't know either round four oh yeah this was the one I mean Zig mentioned Trident poles and then I think I thought Mar now also has Trident PS I don't know um M okay bro I see you but lots of people going uh Central there like Goos token tains area and this was the Java a couple people thought banga because of the no front plate but listen yeah CER day I could have done better I could have done better here couple couple small blunders where if I like really thought about it I could have done better but and then 10 second I got six place which is fine let's see how we place this was a seed that you probably get 24K on if you and Dusky coming in first congrats I think that's his first placement uh believe a lot of people going per on that the problem with Peru in Bolivia or the problem with Bolivia is that most people have learned every Road in Bolivia or so they thought but every now and then there's like one random road that they haven't seen and then and when they don't see that road they just assume that it's Peru because they haven't seen it in Bolivia and this is serbi a pavement um that I probably should have got you get like this like this pavement is Sera uh where it's like you know like checkered like that uh perfectly and it looks Dutch okay and then round three what was round three this is the Bolivia one as well boring ground for the Norway makes sense great guess by de de spent a lot of time on Norway so shout out to him for getting the right Road there and round five was a PTO Rico I don't think any one uh couple Dominican Republics there's one and then some yeah this is fine though just cck Sam Juan it's the best thing yeah no one wi East though so myip is getting eight zigzag is getting 17 he just needs a first place finish finish to win and trabot is at 12 can he do tomorrow let's find out but I will see you guys tomorrow ", "locations":

right we're back with another day of some J guys hopefully today it's a day full of some oh Bish K oh no yeah you probably just go Bish K here kind of boring though only losing 10 points round one oh is this this is the road up here the five I don't want I don't know how far north I want to go here though think something like this is probably fine ah was a little North that's okay round three looks like a North East Brazil with water South what is this what water is this never it looks like it could be like like what where would this make sense up here like that there one of these like with like a weird Inlet like Max North like something like this by S Louis I'll do that no it's not over there I lost where it was somewhere over here I don't know it's just a random body of water wait what were we looking at am I tripping was there not water there I guess it's just not on the map that's kind of unfortunate go faster you car you're tell me this big body of water is not mapped at all that's beautiful though holy crap wait what I'm not sure that I can't even cope on that cuz it wasn't even this Italy or Greece or what no this right here doesn't feel Greek this brick I guess Italy is my best guess it could be Crow or something I guess I don't know what this is I was getting foreit cam again maybe somewhere over here like this sign feels I'm I know I'm think somewhere like over here I guess just a little more south okay found round oh man this is a beautiful eucalyptus tree I bet that smells so good man I love eucalyptus scent top one I remember when I was in Australia I would just go find some leaves and just sniff them smells so good all right where where did you go here though this is really beautiful beautiful maybe a pretty standard day Gen 2 camera Focus let's get to the at least gen three here maybe gen four there we go Gen four um wait I wasn't even thinking Vic I think be Taz I guess I don't know really quite literally no one enjoys you at all Australia um yeah I guess you know in hindsight maybe Vic isn't a good guess here but I don't really care gin that means eat yeah that was a fine day I mean kind of slow but I I enjoyed it I wish I went more North on the five here it wasn't even the five it was the eight I'm not sure why I remember I was One V oneing RC a couple weeks ago and he's like oh man if it's Autumn coverage just go north I should have listened to him should have would it could have um but yeah I mean it's a pretty standard day I'm not complaining seed we played too many seeds twice I can't I'm just gonna I I just want to give it to them just one just one seed today that was a fun seed to play and maybe fun for you guys because you guys you guys want to learn it's not as fun if you guys just get insanely hard locations every time for the sake of me trying to have fun with my friends all right oh it's 10 seconds I forgot freak yeah okay whatever can be SP or Lima like dude this just always just click Lima I'm like actually shooting the is this over this city over here oh my god dude you know why I knew this I want to go here I might go here like this week bro I love this architecture in this city so much that I and I always told myself if I ever get this city on you because I just like if I ever want to visit somewhere in Thailand I'll just like go and stream you just like look at places because it's sick and I was like dude this architecture always seems like if I ever got in in uh jesser I would recognize it and I finally actually got it in Geer and I recognized it so I'm actually very proud of myself I want to go here this is a beautiful city um a actually beautiful city because I the bridge uh look at this dude oh my God I have to go here all right if this gets 5,000 likes I'll go here this week oh my God like actually 5,000 likes I'll go here dude yeah this is a beautiful beautiful city man beautiful city I love Thailand all right let's not choke this uh final round here oh man it's not Ireland right not trolling it's probably Ireland I don't really care though just Scotland okay I mean yeah that was fun I I'm actually really proud of myself for getting this though um I'm actually really proud of myself for getting that that's that's kind of a baller move too all right a pretty standard day all around but it was an enjoyable day I think nothing too crazy couple of you know ones you had to use your nogget on and uh and just some kind of fun I guess Orin guessing ones but all in all fun day solid we'll see who comes away at Victorious but um yeah we'll see wait why are we doing arbitrary I was hoping you wouldn't notice it was an accident I forgot to type in the the rur part of that that's funny yeah yeah I don't know this this uh Road angle low key works I don't know see I thought it was this road cuz the I don't know the coverage kind of looks like it but the trees are throwing me off but I think it is just like further south somewhere or no maybe it is further north I'm going to switch to further north okay good yeah just somewhere in general North like here maybe okay SAR Bulgaria I think this looks pretty Western I would say just going to go like here oh wait no it's Italy damn I thought this signs were Bulgarian but I guess they have them in it's Australia uh yeah I don't know it's like a I don't know if it's Sydney or Melbourne I'm GNA go near Melbourne nope it was Brisbane actually interesting GL we're holding hands down there me and Blinky yeah I think you still beat me though to be fair no that was close though glad you got the right there I remember you told me when you remember the one time me we One V one like on coverage what is this why does it look like Brazil I'm confused it is just Brazil okay uh this one's actually kind of tough I don't know it's like here somewhere I told you just lost a bunch of Lima clickers uh no I don't I don't know if I well I mean I know the road but I don't remember it looking like that particularly so is this like east of Indies echa or something like like here somewhere I don't know okay yeah this looks fairly Northern I would say I kind of want to go like Chang Rai no oh man I don't know this I wanted to go Scotland here honestly okay yeah GL I got Scotland at least but Thailand is a classic blunder ronos is Thailand okay okay that was a fun location that was a fun location oh is it this thing I I just had looked at this city a lot before and just recognized it with the architecture and these houses right here just feel had felt different to me uh like they're pretty distinct for that like reang region yeah all right all right it's next day um have we do 27 people playing turo playing from the gpos islands respect I got 15 you know if I'm consistently getting top 15 I would be okay with that you know like a 15 Mark is like okay you know round one everyone getting Kirk that boring uh okay they're Road here yeah some people look at oh my God 96 bullets out here representing on the five um but you know with the going east west I guess it does make more sense but everyone getting kind of that region Yukon Northeast Brazil anyone go actually near water no I'm mean just a freaking loser over there good Lord should just near like an actual RC is not alone in the Bulgaria so good validation for you when that went bulgary there you have a lot of other people there with you um Italy yeah click Center click Rome what was this this was the Oz Oscar yeah getting the closest there does make sense where did Eddie end up going did Eddie play what round was this five wait what happened to Eddie I need Eddie's validation sorry guys Eddie's a really good Australian player so I'm calling Eddie out oh he went up north okay he went Queensland so I'm just a skill sh I thought it was he went Vic um the L players is kind of going against Vic and Taz so my zigzag and bag and I recorded zigzag but I literally forgot to record both our audios so I'm sorry guys the content will be back I promise okay also see always tells EXA I'm recording his games because he just plays better under pressure all right and then 10 second trior popped off dude trior maybe at the end of the season we can do like an award show and it could be like biggest choke or like most clutch this guy tricker is like the most clutch like South by decided okay I'll just Google okay buddy and this is a Peru EA a lot people EA couple Colo couple non or like Dr Ziggy that's my teammate and de okay de not my teammate but congrats um got line here yeah me and Ziggy bro we get it we get it bro we just know the peninsula architecture that's my teammate lot people going north I guess and then having uh Harry or not go Scotland validates me so and Donis Guess m gets five zigzag gets 15 and two is a third bag got nine so Blinky and zag are not tied kind of like the video I post on my main Channel all right I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

right I'm back with another day of some J hopefully today has a good day hopefully it would be a shame if it wasn't this looks like one of those roads in Bolivia I should know but I don't and so I'm going to say it is which would be one of these roads down here let just a pause okay round two looks like a Poland surprisingly enough could be a France I think it could be France actually I like France more now I look at it a little bit more um yeah I like France a lot do I like France as a country a lot is a question yeah it's okay I think it's a cool place to visit maybe the southern France would be a little bit more based than like a parish or something but I think as a country I think has a lot going for it it has wimy I mean what more do you want I'm gonna go like something like actually like over here by Paris like all right L more south okay we're have a little Brazil action here and honestly like I just have to hard commit like Rio like something like something over here like I I have to hard commit I'm gonna hard commit the border right here actually like I think I literally might have let's just find a road let's just line up the freaking Road shall we it's literally this road right here I mean all things Ser it's not really that bad of a guess but like sure me I'll take it ooh Southern RG action I all my comments on my most recent video on my main Channel were like It's So cringe that they say Colo not listen guys I'm sorry how far south do I want to go I want to go pretty far south there's like very little vegetation no trees I mean is there I mean there's a slight Mountain South too I don't know I think it's somewhere pretty South here something like over here even more south dude I was so close to the right Road you're not even like it's not even funny I was on this road right here I was ler on that road I mean that would I mean what's the difference between you know 4,800 and 4600 but still all right just five of five it is I can get a decent score here but too bad I freaking suck at Russia cuz I'm a little baited male that's the reason why because I don't want to learn this I think it's it's obviously Southern Russia over here though somewhere I feel like the coverage on the Gen 4 Ro here is like less green though so I don't really want to go over here like this makes sense maybe even like down here what do I do here is it ever actually even like over here like like no no no no it's South for sure I'm not going to Gaslight myself I should start gaslighting myself I really I mean was what was this one was this an easy round I forgot uh yeah like friend I think most people go France here what was this one Bolivia that one was kind of free Southern Arch was a nice guess and I would do one more seed that was less boring but like I haven't a turn in like an hour and I kind of need to prep for it sure and yeah I mean these are really the only games oh I have too much time I can't look let's going be somewhere over here wow what a guess bro holy poop okay this is like the least gorgeous like think I've ever seen like holy crap that was beautiful I can even take it in I want to just engage it it five five go go like some token team Goos that's it's like B ah Goos okay bro kind have a sleeper day all around oh dud I Sur just do one more 40 second shouldn't I all right I'll do one more 40 second round hopefully it's a better seed and I'll just send them whatever is the better vers better more entertaining seed for them not based off what is that oh my God is that [ __ ] Santa and his reindeer up there what the hell it's actually Santa Claus and like Rudolph all right what is this so this over for Scotland they France or I actually have no idea what this is in Wales okay bro bro why I think this is like Australia because it is where in Australia would this be you silly goose this is kind of a base lock what the hell it's just Vic then I guess oh Mount Gambier how about you go suck lock in this is this is a base seat okay so they're getting a good seed I'm doing worse on this one so it's okay yo is This Server actually like a slow I actually like a slow here or like what else could this be a Poland I like a southern Poland actually I like a southern Poland svenia oo this is a fun fun location oh we're using our Noggin look at this I don't feel like this hill looks typically polish but also these trees don't feel very Slovenian I'm going go Southern Poland actually oh it was Northern po the northern polish Hills got the country or the country R so we take that that why are they driving right is he lost is he like not like is he is just because this is like bumpy right here and he's on the right because I thought this was like like over here in Indo but is it it would it would be Cambodia but where in hell would this coverage be in Cambodia literally but it doesn't really look like is it Malaysia but they drive left too so I have to commit something so I go like right here no I go if it's codia oh that's actually great guess wow okay oh that's all let's just throw it all away right here what a great seed to get here last last time I I really had to sit here and use my I mean my Mia thought here was France but like what do I do is it wait what C is this ever Germany like Bavaria oh Lord I don't know it could be France or like what is this ah whatever I mean I'm okay with that score lowkey that was really fun like really had to like I had a couple really like 20K will give me top 10 for sure people that you know are better than me would do better obviously but I mean all all no I had I had fun playing that seed this one was like I don't know like you could get whales here for sure I see most people going Scotland we had Santa uh this one wasn't an obvious France in my opinion I mean France is my first thought but like for some reason this card just looked hella German to me not sure why and then this one Poland not sure how many people even get Poland here cuz it's kind of a hard guess I mean actually kind of does look polish I guess I'm not sure how many people go Northern pole in there this I spent the first 20 seconds thinking was Europe for some reason because of these Ballers I thought they were [ __ ] like Danish Ballers or something so I was confused and then this one bro was driving on the wrong side the road so I was really confused but I just couldn't make out and also like this over here I mean this didn't look like anything Cambodia but the reason why I thought Cambodia was cuz I thought this actually no not really this doesn't really look anything like kood at all I thought I saw a house on T on wooden stilts which is uh like I can see like I thought this was like elevated up and this is the floor but wait could you see the Indonesian flag I guess technically you could actually but there's no way anyone sees that with these oil Palms you felt more like this I mean I don't think you get anything like this in Cambodia BR I would luck it watch hopefully okay the case interesting it's Gen 2 it looks like Scotland to me trying to think of anything else that's possible I don't think I can play it outside of Scotland or maybe Ireland uh no trees at all this could be a island as well like a Scottish Island maybe uh but I think I maybe this one that's a nice little hedge that would be interesting do they really have such Hills going to hge it like that oh sheesh look at all this up here together just a someone will get that but few will get that correct yeah it's one those things where it's like the UK is kind of yeah you pick up like I guess a thousand points but yeah we have some gray car SL white car Australia can be hard to tell if it's gray car I think that's really more common in South Australia however if it's white car it definitely looks more like Victoria so what do I actually want to go for then I guess I would actually trust that this is gray car and Goa it's extremely flat huh it could be like it could be like here oh if it's down here I'm going to be annoyed cuz that's what it looks like but I'm I'm I'm going trust the car oh that makes sense yeah uh yeah I definitely considered that too JK told me he was going to bed like an hour ago and he's already playing the scene this guy okay okay what we got what we got one flowers this is kind of tough I think like uh Poland came to mind firstly here CIA is pretty good as well maybe I don't mind czechia cuz I think it kind of hedges for what's possible a little bit better I'm going to go Northern czechia to uh wait this surely not Baltic yeah I don't think it's btic I hope not we'll see okay it's just B yeah damn okay Nigeria that was my first thought we have oil Palms so you have to consider um Indo uh I think I think it is actually yeah we have a Sula a Sumatra Palm so I would say this is K monan or Sumatra the big blur on the camera looks more C Monon admittedly yeah no I'm going to try that like you know we're a bit behind here I'm going to say South Central C Monon cuz that's where you normally see the blur even though it looks maybe more Sumatran uh yeah it's just Sumatra yeah I mean coming from behind I feel like I wanted to try something your cards and now it doesn't matter too much but let's get this correct yeah I'm just going to go for on it should be not too far south though okay okay let's go mhm so Poland Baltic we got firee should be a bit further north I like I like Lavia I like laia b l enjoyer uh this is just Colombia or Mexico of the two I would say Columbia is just more likely here Sur yeah okay there it yeah y on other so far H Thailand gosh damn it that's just middle really this is just middle yeah yeah well similar guesses very so far what 43 points apart it's Som BR uh Italy this reminded me of the French B unless this is somehow Romania that would be crazy no no this should be like here oh other side damn and the last one's Brazil and we've got sugar cane and South Vibes but it's also extremely red soil so I'm going to go in the uberlandia uh pocket it's go all right it's the next day let's see how we did oh my God I was in like second place BL and oh my god what happened dude this the guy bag finishes every SE like 10 seconds and somehow always gets like top five also pretty based I wasn't trying to like you make the video is like 2 minutes long I probably don't have the attention span either so let's see I think a lot of people probably mess up with the Australia here but this will be interesting to see round one wow harer of course you know the UK goat uh getting whales there yeah you have to go Scotland there let's be honest holy oh okay yeah so o oh this is the essay one oh interesting yeah yeah okay this was the Australia one I was thinking of the other one we had a couple days ago um zigzag the only person get South Australia right I mean I Vic yeah I thought a couple people going north New Zealand people going kind of a demarker or think something like that just without like looking at too long or looking at the trees and focusing on the road I could see a Europe there lots of people getting Poland here dude getting this is like the thing about you guys he that like okay also okay I thought he was hedging Beller I was like that's kind of alpha but people were getting like 4800 points for going Lithuania Northern Poland like just like use like two of the top people in the top three are in the top three because they went Lithuania on Poland am I salty yes do I take this too seriously yes this IND one was kind of crazy too okay yeah nor Matra I really like the Nigeria gu here to be honest the Nigeria guas is actually so valid um and the Cambodia is too because they thought they were driving right um but yeah no it's just the oil Pals there and then round five come on Donis ah I thought someone gets Germany with me or V did okay okay before I become a hypocrite right let me see okay people with that guess FR got more points so it's it's it's not as bad okay all right and then 10- second one how' I do got seventh it's just a day of seven seven seven seven I am doing this quick because I honestly just kind of want to go back and watch I want to watch the Dolphins Chiefs game right now okay guys I'm it's like half time I'm trying to trying to watch this okay Estonia a lot of people just going btics makes sense the Colo Thailand Central Tha or like downtown Bangkok I think this is a pretty standard seed the Alps yeah wait actually I want to see in 10 seconds Gorka this guy Gorka found the road and trctor was trying to get to the road but he said he can't get there in 10 seconds um which is valid and then yeah Brazil lots of just lots of central guesses there I went a little to Northeast but it's fine it's fine trior trior is a goat like actually trior should go saato Blinky getting 15 aan getting 12 and totic getting six Blinky is taking the lead by a little bit of a margin here he could technically win in two days will he though next time we will find out and I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 52.50536601473923, "lng": -3.872377720874431},

right we're back with another day of some hopefully today I get to use my Noggin let's do it close my eyes close my eyes close my eyes stain fing stain fing I think it's be like right here it would have been cool if it was closer what the [ __ ] is this rocks why is this lowkey look like it could be like a Bolivia Santa Cruz type thing I'm not sure what else it could be this road feels weird something over here on the nine probably sure okay little more south fine life goes on this is where we just the USA surely it's like something like one of the cities or states like you don't really want to live in you know something over here I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm blurred okay actually this could be Canada actually kind of like can no I wait that's Mountains east what the [ __ ] Southeast or mountains going Montana then wait what the hell is it over here I'm kind of him me him don't choke it bro if you choke this all right luckily I'm the goat at Turkey you know what they call me right the goat at Turkey they call me the Thanksgiving gobler does anyone watch these videos as like I I hope like if I'm anyone's like sort entertainment for like an after school snack or like a bedtime like story or like lunch break like I've fulfilled every purpose I could possibly do in life and I'm currently just yapping because I'm trying to act like I know what this could be but I really don't but good thing I do God damn it that would been really cool if I was right though not gonna lie beautiful mountains okay so I'm going to go ahead and assume this is like somewhere down here those feel like they could be those mountains could be in Argentina you know they're West though South wait what the freck wait where would this be then I don't know I'm going somewhere over here it could be more south actually no it's never down south it's never Southern PTO or south of PTO right actually yeah it could be dude I don't I can't commit down here d i i it was kind of a good switch I mean I got closer and to think I mean where would else would mountains make sense West like nothing up here had mountains west so I was like okay I have to kind of commit but then this was in like the ridge so that really guess didn't really make sense and this is the only place that has mountains not East but West kind of getable wait that was the end of it I wanted harder locations dude all right I'm going do one more and I hope that my friends appreciate it because I don't want to see my friends like an easyc that's like sure this is indo not tie pavement [Music] right great guess Mr rainbolt there's no way bro there's no way is it for a actually think it might be Aur wait dude I'm actually cooking right now like wait dude if this is Deval wait bro why am I cooking so hard I'm I'm not going to say my fres because there's a repeat in it but like for the sake of like getting a good score I mean actually it's not I could get 24K if I 5K this actually but somewh down here ah I 237 I'm not saying my friends that score either but that's a great score one more whatever it is they have to deal with it okay and this is what we like to see who's ready to go wrong continent I am whatever whatever happens happens okay I've D okay so my first instinct here was immediately like in Australia like dude they felt like a weird like Queensland like I've seen them Forest appear look like this but like it it'd be weird no but like what else could this be the US this tree right here it looks like a eucalyptus or like it feels weird lock in great guess Southern Poland don't choke guala I don't think you get this antana East that's the only thing I know about guala okay oh oh yeah we're gaming and I would do we might go around country here but that's okay okay so is this actually my first immedate thought was like bro just go Sardinia just just rip a Sardinia for the homies you know I said listen bro what else could this what I mean is it Italy is it France is it Spain is it Spain and the S is silent is it don't choke dude this is a great seed can you guys appreciate how good the seed was I mean this was a horrible way to end it and for the memes okay it's people though it's be I mean I played pretty out of my mind today but I like to see lot because this was a hard location I feel like like I love this location let's do a 10- second now and I'm going to try and do this in like five seconds actually lock in us your nogin okay bro Sun South is this Mexico or us how is it like get [ __ ] what is okay this SE is based AF bro what is this Forest somewhere in like wait what is this bro solaka who the dude this might be one of my favorite locations of the entire Series this might be my favorite location of the entire series I can't even cope because South Korea wouldn't have even been in my top 20 guesses am I am I that bad have I fallen off that much that I never once thought of a South Korea here I I don't know what to say why are we driving right I mean looks like it's Kenya I was doing so well I want to slay my desk so bad that might be one of the worst blunders of this entire series you know it's bad when you just immediately backs space you're like just don't you can't look look at the screen anymore wow that's a world class fumble right there dude okay famous last words why are we driving right this looks like Kenya why did I say that and then I thought okay it's this freaking fi that looks like you get in Western Kenya bro ah whatever I can't even cope today was such a fun day um with the highest of highs and low of blows getting wrong content back to back what a way to end it yeah this guy uh someone take away his map privilege after that one all right it happens it happens let's see how everyone else does all right ready yeah let's do it good luck yo let's Go Peru Bolivia think it looks this is a 10 seconds oh it's the 10 second the wrong link I'm just letting you know before that one okay that one okay thank you all right we'll play 10 second first that's kind of fascinating why is so dry and everything no it's not exactly there okay yeah we had American fences yeah I saw that just now not the first time I'm like makes it easier right yeah not a bad guess all around Good Start yeah UK for sure for sure just somewhere here what's that uh I look like Thailand better here oh Korea is crazy though dude I didn't even think Asia at all bro I was like down I was just kind of stuck on at least you got the Asian Vibes but is that not crazy South Korea bro like what the hell what map are we playing dude it has to be handpicked CLI wa click the lock bro click the lock yeah Korea locations don't exist bro like like this they don't exist like even no moving most people miss this yeah like dude this dude how's this ever like Korea although to be honest like looking at it longer it does not look tropical like I thought it was so yeah so it's exactly thank you corn crops it feels very R like maybe Ms or something oh wow that's uh if anyone gets that good job if anyone gets to South Korea I'm kind of calling cheats I'm being honest all right 4 40 seconds let's go ah time to chill out uh what do we have we have Pines and do we have eucalyp as wello I'm struggling to like see on my new monitor I think we have eucalyp as well yeah 2021 okay this could be ours then this could definitely be ours this would be have to be pretty far north as well yeah these are the kind of Pines you get in ours for sure I could be tripping here it could be like Mech or something or no you don't have Ealy uh oh good why okay nice was cooking yeah the only reason I remember that was because if we had like a one turny I feel like you remember that one lock in that tney like two years ago with bokei and they sat in there for like two hours I don't know look like the same Forest yeah I mean yeah can just is uh built different in terms of vegetation and stuff doesn't look like Australia most of the time okay okay we have to aframe Holy poles but it kind of looks like Poland I think wait I think those ones they don't exist in uh Romania so it has to be Poland or and it looks like the hles go down to the ground maybe so that would make it more Hungarian wait but it looks more like Poland so so uh the fact that it's so green it's not typical Hungarian coverage I'm going to go hungry anyway okay well I'll you top I mean what do this gu you're fine e uh that's a Italian pole top uh it could be uh Sardinia maybe struggling to think where this would be in normal Italy uh and what else what other country is even possible with Gen 2 it should just be Italy I believe but don't know maybe I don't really think of anything better than S here wait what's your point differential right now it's like pretty close yeah oh no this is disgusting this is Eastern and slightly what do the trees look like I don't know slightly Southern I thought you about to go Japan okay that was a good game wait what's 23 2 232 bro if I just went I mean I was going to go like here yeah that could be 24K potentially yeah yeah oh my gosh actually hella dumb but everything else every other guess is good so well the thing is like I don't think I can win because some one's going to get the Oz and the Poland but I think You' be surprised I think people might get the Oz but be hard from to get the Oz and the Sardinia maybe but yeah Sardinia is also Sardinia also requires a bit of a cook that's true fun day G GG's uh what the hell we got some Pines I I have no idea I kind of thought of like Brazil it reminds me of the Brazil Ram we had a few days ago with the Pines I don't know o is possible maybe it's more Lo with the soil color CU like some of the trees kind of look like eucalyptus it's like Queensland or something like Northern Queensland I've seen some Pines okay I should have gone full North dude I should have gone full North cuz I knew the Pines are like around there I kind of hedged yeah it's all right Poland mountains I would assume we're like here somewhere okayest that's fine I know this kind of cringe but I kind of want to think think of like if I actually know the road that's not cring RC okay thank you thank you for validating me I think it's actually really cool that you can know the road I don't know the road on this one though unfortunately but we're gonna try that one okay I got pretty close if you zoom out you know the road okay I thought Italy but ever something else pole I can't say I recognize it but I kind of want to go ity here Ser Sardinia no I will go just Mainland okay it is Sardinia bro Famous Last Words average let's see now I actually want to try and like do good on this so that I can like maybe clutch up I feel like it's Northeast no I mean you cled up a third I guess yeah I got third you know can't can't not be happy with that Peru and this is like Lake Area yeah I'll just leave it here okay a little more North that's fine I thought like AR or Chile [ __ ] I don't know no it's US ah okay not Ireland nope it's Wales fair enough okay this one actually kind of looks like the us though oh go like drift list or something no wait what that's what I'm saying that is insane see I see I knew it was in Europe I was like that kind of looks like the US I don't know okay no you keep my score still so yeah that was a tough seed must be said let's take a look it's in the book it's the Reading Rainbow Rie thoughts on ninja getting a low taper fade uh I can't remember the last time I saw ninja so honestly good for him I guess the trees aren't that us but they certainly weren't Europe like I I knew they weren't European so I was like this is something weird like driftless or something let's see what Bas holy look at us yeah you both got 19 points together congrats okay I think Slovakia guess is more based personally but look it's like this area around the Mississippi and like this part the and it's like just uh random forests you see it's like more forested than the rest of the Midwest so you'll get like random forests around there looks pretty and there's not really good good views have you been here no I have not it's a shame that looks like dude that does not look like Minnesota yeah it's it's actually a really pretty area oh the reason it's called driftless is because um like the Midwest is so flat cuz there are glaciers there and they drifted back North but the driftless area was the one area they didn't drift so that's why like that's the only area that's not like flat as a pancake cuz it didn't drift there so it was driftless driftless it's kind of a bar low key maybe one day you can go to driftless yep thanks RC I'll quickly do this just to see we can just see where everyone went I won't go I won't go round by round but just to get a journal F actually well I'll just do a very service level Australia a lot of people going Europe us makes sense trees I'll going austral going the wrong region just yeah lot people going Northern Hungary here uh and then yeah lot people going Poland great guys D where did D play today no 27 not bad Donis okay round three

here that were like this tree line felt so European I was like where the heck did you get this fence in Europe and this road didn't really match anything in Europe either so I'm not sure where my guess I mean my guess doesn't really make sense cuz I just clicked Mexico CU I didn't know but I think that like a Tabasco yeah like something yukatan would make more sense for this guess I think people will get that but uh um yeah kago I'm sorry all right 10 seconds on the clock now dude I'm like hype now because of that song Let's like oh then this is my Redemption Arc wait no this is oh

it's just Sweden [ __ ] off you know life life has ups and downs as roller coasters and it's when you're on the roller coaster of life it's about enjoying the highs and taking in the lows and learning from the lows see I could look at this and be like wow I'm not very good I can't believe I went Indonesia on a clear Taiwan or I could be like man 10 seconds on the clock you were in Croatia you were in Germany but you sucked your guns and you said wait this is Italy this is Eastern Italy by Slovenia and by golly it was you know it's and hind slight this may be is a free Taiwan and I'm just kind of bad this rock I know this is sound crazy guys I know this is going to sound crazy but these rocks feel way more Taiwan than anything else like if I saw those rocks I probably would have went Taiwan and like I know cope cap whatever call it these rocks fill Taiwanese like I don't know if those are as common all right all right let's do 10 seconds now hopefully I don't choke back to back because if I did that I would be quite upset and I would probably go down quite the this is gapon or is it like ptor I think I'm going is there a krger okay was just down there not this is not this is just Thailand lock in really haven't used my nog in here I'm G to go West Australia this is freaking I'm going up here I'm going if it's West don't choke is this testing me I said if I would recognize

it's be wait is that actually a pine it is a panine dude so like it's just hiding there yeah I mean us is a horrible guest but like what the [ __ ] do you want from me in 10 seconds you can't blame me on that was a base day this was a fun day like I said I'm I'm normalizing bad guesses okay this round four was not a bad guess round five was a bad guess like what do you want from me I don't know where to go I could have gone Argentina I never go [ __ ] Brazil here especially whatever I'm done coping whatever we are back we are so back let's do it walk in all right okay what is that 20 classic

trees oh sure yeah tree disease look you see yeah I don't get it though it looks like it's like from Dr Seuss yeah but it it's like a tree disease where they like the branches get bunched up for some reason oh that's kind of sad I seen it in Georgia too like when I was driving down to PLS like a few days like a week ago I uh saw the tree disease as well so wait what makes a tree disease like all the trees are like that like anywhere you go you'll but like why what causes it I have no idea what disease it is but surely how do you know a disease someone out there knows or how do you not like dude that's the coolest it looks like it's little on a tree bro I I feel like I might have saw a mention somewhere that was a tree disease what is that oh it's invasive mistletoe wait that's crazy

right it's another day of some GE guesser and I hope everyone is ex as excited as I am to make sure that we have good guesses today shall we game one round one Australia have a yellow marking on this pole wooden pole it's not going to be it's not going to be Vic or it's not going to be South Australia because that I think this right here is a Vic pole though so I'm going to go Vic here like Northeast Vic that's my best bet here something like over here all things considered bad guess but we'll take it this is a boring Southern Philippines okay and I just realized I'm playing with car on with no car script on whoops okay okay this is not helpful for your boy because now I'm kind of committed because I can't show the game link so I'm going to go pero something just by Lima makes sense to me I should have went actually by Lima boring South Korea okay and the final round here is a presumably Nova Scotia New Brunswick kind of this region over here it's my best bet yeah I'm gonna go New Brunswick it was 231 but quite the boring day maybe and I played with no car though which maybe is a little bit of an extra little oomph in my step all around that was a pretty boring seed honestly um let's do one more I don't think I it's boring it's just a capital all right I'm GNA play the no car script off though because let's be honest I need every Advantage I can get here let's be honest game one lock in little SC action surely never Georgia never anything else it's just it's just it's just on the border of South Carolina Georgia and the more you overthink it the more it hurts you yes it could be Alabama yes it could be Miss no it's definitely over here somewhere lock in SC State streak one okay see this is going to be a fun one surely this is just a pole we have double white center lines looks like this could be a holy pole A-frame pole and so I'm just going go some more Central Poland here that's my best bet gin more like do I want to go over here near the lake my first thought was like oh it could be like a Chell beans but I'm like it looks kind of East it looks like it be somewhere one of these roads over here like even one of these white roads down here I feel like it could be something like that that's what I'm thinking bunch of birch though which makes sense for like Western is but I'm gonna try this I'm gonna throw my keyboard out the window there's a freaking bike path just it it said listen you get know chance Mr rainbow you get another chance to prove yourself so by golly will you do it and I said listen I'll take the opportunity with Grace and I said put me in coach because I'm ready to [ __ ] play Let's go I said listen you get another chance Mr rainbow you get another chance to prove yourself so bye golly will you do it and I said listen I'll take the opportunity with Grace and I said put me in coach because I'm ready to [ __ ] play Let's Go I can't believe I fumbled that I mean I knew it was East I thought was I honestly thought it was this road but I'm like why is it not paved cuz this Road's paved but looked like that but I honestly did not know that this yow road is not was unpaved why are you like why are you not paved I thought it was this it looked like this region but it was I'm so salty I'm I'm such a sore loser let me copy that paste that link I mean I guess this could be a yellow road but like it's pretty big but still let's play 10 seconds and uh Escape escape the pain pain 10 seconds on the clock like the Party Don't Stop lock in bro this trees on the side I feel polish nothing else screams me at all except [ __ ] random forest in Germany or in Europe shout out to the tree if this is ever North Petoria I'm sad I'm doing it North Petoria it was just Petoria we'll take it though lock in that looks like an norat pole no one can tell me anything different it was a Cali pull I might it's same Bel Liv pavement I'm going in the same town it was last time it was somewhere down here Bel pavment it works learn your pavement this looks like Salo there's panop Pines ah I don't know Cali I don't know Indonesian poles and this is kind of where I'm just too lazy to learn things like this where the people that learn the polls know it but I I'm too I'm honestly too lazy to do that I'm too lazy I can spend like probably 10 minutes a day and do it but I just can't be can't be asked I think the I think the PS I was think of they're symmetrical in the middle and there's there a symetrical on each side I think that's what I'm thinking of but all in all I didn't really make any bad guesses today so I'll take it but um I'm I'm proud of this polling call out this is actually really really good polling guess in my opinion um I don't see this is a pretty hard Poland and I'm proud I'm proud of that so um I'll I'll anchor this one rather than not knowing a freaking polls in Indonesia but let's see how let's see how everyone else does lock in locking in okay um so this is either South Carolina or Louisiana I know that's so weird uh it's actually actually a tough one cuz this is like they literally look the same sometimes um I'm going to say South Carolina over here okay okay so he decided turn the scripts on okay I guess it's Poland it looks kind of weird but I guess yeah it has to be it's like hilia as well so interesting I'm thinking like something down here maybe or like here I don't know I'm going to go there no of course it's the Northern Hills bro hate those is this the Eastern Russia Road like the uh somewhere along here like this coverage I don't know which parts are unpaved but yeah we're like north south so I guess I would try something like this way or maybe slightly more North I'm going to do that I was where I was originally okay everyone went over here that's funny you're in first place right now Ry don't choke I am okay what is this it kind of remind me of the Netherlands I guess uh yeah I think I think it is the Netherlands and I'd probably go like okay closer don't even try and reach and guess what were you doing okay okay this guy it was kind of close to Germany though okay and then we have tilted antenna I guess something fairly Central like riaan or P or over Tombo he's actually cing today bro main road kind of so yeah this would work honestly okay it was pen but yeah basically the same Ro you just got first congrats let's go you also me out third so oh damn I you know I would rather see you succeed against my failures that's that makes that's okay you know also rather see me getting first ons you you at least having two days back to back where you're you're not blendering the that's not happening lock in right now the audience is praying on your upfall oh god um yeah have 5 seconds I forget yeah okay I thought Germany like here okay Poland was that I swear I said 23 but maybe I'm tripping you have 10 seconds to BR looks for copyright that's crazy yeah BR I got to I'm going to go here I guess Bas SK honestly thank you RC for validating me that means a lot yeah uh I don't know I'm I'm not sure between uh Cali and somatra here okay was Cali is it youi yeah try go this one okay good what the heck I know my Bolan roads kind of and then uh something Southern Sonic Arina maybe here okay I kind of mov closer but it's fine okay trior that's my teammate how does trior always get like get how his region guessing is so good yeah oh he's in first place yeah that's impressive oh my god dude did you see my video yesterday RC yeah I barely beat you 14 points and you script it in Mexico what were you doing bro classic wait Jami popped off in IND what happened yeah I mean I thought it was kie so I just clicked in the in the middle of kie and it was close then I saw the p p like last second on the on the oh yeah I went all right RC you played pretty well to they yeah I mean you're yeah I mean you got first place on we'll see if it sticks but congrats also for the audience this might be RC's last day unless we get 10,000 likes and everyone comments RC stay for leaving us for school over we we'll make it work we we'll find something that works we'll make it work all right thanks Ry all right all right it's next morning and RC did end up coming in first here and uh Blinky almost coming in there last second and beating him but to no cigar let's see how everyone did and how we placed today I got what I got fifth you know all in all we'll take it round one SC RC knowing the region South Carolina there Southern Pines most people going south uh Poland lots of good Poland guesses here um aame po a couple people saw holy polls went Hungary and Romania also has the same BS so makes sense it did look like a weird Poland lot of people going east shout out to uh de bra trota Blinky RC bag and Depot for getting the right Road lots of people going east over here kind of on the same white roads over here with me some people going west and uh yeah that scores kind of end all be all Netherlands classic classic classic Netherlands bike path Great Snail region guest we love to see it round five this was the gigachad but Blinky and aan are more gigachad great guesses by them and and and the 10-sec one o 16th I fell short here but I'm still okay with this score because top 10 is still 20,000 points so it's uh quite marginal around around here real quick and you know I'm probably one the only people that got every country right okay I'll put I'll say that shout out to uh trior Azie goer jhk Lenley and trabot for going Poland here lots of Europe guessing here little Z action Blinky getting the night the right park here that's kind of cracked not gonna lie um very very impressive oh yeah this is where I fumbled yeah can be mad at this um we do have some SRA guessers with me here but uh most people are going Cali I'm a good score round four Bolivia Bolivian payment should went more uh I went where it was like super green I should have went more West but I was just trying to think of where that one round was the other day and then uh yeah pretty obvious Southern Brazil here with the piranha Pines all right shout to RC freaking 10 Blinky getting 12 Deb getting seven for for I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 54.27866507701506, "lng": 124.44941090812922}, {"round": 2, "lat": 53.50062265382432, "lng": 43.75735277593822}, {"round": 3, "lat":

right it's another good day of some Jas here we need do challenge link invite friends start game let's have a good day right here okay this pavement I missed Bolivia yesterday this feels like it could be a Bolivia Bolivian pavement down here it was that pavement down there okay round two Sur just go east here right we have a TI Pole looks like why is it so many Palms I don't see this being South wait I know why I'm confused I figured out it took me a second guys it took me a second but I got there in the end and that's almost very embarrassing that's almost very very embarrassing cuz there's Sri Lanka not Thailand okay oh this is fun oh now this is fun now this is where we have to use our Noggin this road feels European nothing else really does the trees feel European it's like a weird Italy where in Italy would make sense or is it like in Asia like it could be like Indonesia I feel like I'm going [Music] Indonesia I don't know if that's a hard guess but I'm super proud of that guess I'm super super whatever happens going forward in this game I'm proud of that guess right there do I go Philly or Indo on Philly no this is just Philly I'm not overthinking it this is never Endo right I'm not throwing if I get that insane Indo guess and they miss this I'm gonna be so sad let go like some somewhere dude this is actually G to be like Eastern Indo though Eastern Java or something wait am I trolling oh no bro I'm actually trolling I have to go I have to go into here if this is if this Philly dude I'm going be no I have to go Philly no I have to go indo oh no bro wait I'm going Philly first [Music] instinct dude I'm so bad this mix you just have to laugh at that you just have to laugh at it oh man okay let me make sure this is next to Argentina [Music] why did I loky like Argentina here I mean the sun's directly south it should me more in the northern hemisphere but like why did Loki like Northern Argentina here I cannot believe I did that bro that's such a free uh dang it dude that's two days in a row I I blunder bro and they're literally on the exact same region wait I 5K it was the exact same place I guessed bro ah dude that's so frustrating oh it's so frustrating I think a lot of I get no I lose this one by far but that's a fun I I don't really care about how I play because that was just a 50-50 blunder I just miss cuz I'm bad but that was that was a fun game of you y sir that I'm really glad I got to play and also like getting around like this and like this was such a great moment for me because I honestly didn't know where this was and it felt like these trees ly felt like European to me but like this didn't really feel European to me at all like these branches and like I didn't really know where it would look like this at all in Italy or in Europe or I really only thought the only possibility in Europe would be Italy and then I saw this last second I'm like where the [ __ ] would this bad boy be in Europe and I was like ah Indo because the pavement looked Indonesian but hey you win some you lose some but all around this was a really I probably one of the most fun days I've had yet all things since here so games like that are the reason why this game is still so fun you know when it comes down like a 5050 and you're like what is this you know it's in between two this road surely okay I have to use my my Noggin see this is what I like I like using my Noggin this is France or the UK I go France Belgium great guess I'll take that guess um Gen 4 red car is Sweden by the way or it's it's in like so and things like that too but I'm going to go pretty North here feels pretty North guess right back in France this is czechia uh I'm going to head Germany and head cheia France it was France I assume it's France I didn't want to commit and Northern Finland this time presumably L more south okay yeah fine um but no that that first game was so fun because uh um yeah just having to think and having to use your your head and having moments like that to come down like that are so fun I'm gonna look at it again real quick I think in hindsight like this guy with a bike this is a I think this is a free Indo actually like with especially with this pavement I'm not sure why I thought Philly and this guy with a looks pretty Indonesian um it's still fun though I don't hold as much weight on guesses like that when it was a fun fun guess I mean I feel like I I literally called like Java or Philly so that's fine and I had fun that's all that matters right it's having fun let's see how uh let's see how RC does all right it's the next day sorry I couldn't get RC's I literally I'm just an old man and just like injured myself last night I'll put a clip here dude I'm sorry chat I'm I'm really sorry I'm like really trying thank God I'll be right back I'm I'm going to go lay down oh my God I'm going to join the VC give me like five minutes guys oh [ __ ] D I have a doctor's appointment in like an hour and I'm sorry this video is late but Hey listen we're we're thriving okay nothing can stop me from doing a daily video okay how did I do in the first seed I got 19th honestly I'm kind of okay with that you know there's some good names below I'm okay with 19th RC got 18th Oh my he beat me by 14 points bro oh I wish I had that recorded oh my God this guy actually scripts to beat me that's so cringe okay and this right here tells you everything you need to know about this seed that this is a perfect screenshot of what you need let's go through it bivia bivan pavement um great guess there by Jacob and Blinky Tri Lanka I lost like 900 points in Sri Lanka not sure why I thought that was South but it's okay intoo a call out a lot of people getting Java here a lot of people getting Indo couple Philly a Taiwan two Spain uh a Panama I like the Panama guess Mexico yeah all valid all valid in my opinion um yeah that's why I was content with my my you know my Java call it there this one I blundered only two people in one another person in Philly with me yeah I blundered I I'm not sure why I overthought that one I think I think a lot of it is like I don't like getting the same country back toback because I feel like I'm less likely to go there because I just got it you know okay okay RC had a great guess there okay of course RC decides to script round five to beat me like you're so cringe bro you're so [ __ ] cringe like dude um the mova base malova guesser based uh some arge Brazil not bad not bad and then the 10-c one I got 11th which is okay yeah it is okay let's see how everyone did here that's very very good very wow jjk G 23k on this one impressive another day of like that yeah round one lots of people getting the right region wow trabot getting the right Road right here in Russia impressive to say JK getting pretty close as well a lot of people in the same region people going Poland that's all good round two France a lot of good France guesses here great guess by mackam Northern Norway with those trees this is a France hedge czechia and Germany or and France here cuz I didn't know which one was France great guesses all around now but this is just all over Europe up here kind of impressive and then just a Finland a lot of people going north with me or a couple people going north great guys by Trick are getting the road right May potato getting his first points

right we're back with another day of some Geer and today is a good day that I okay so we're in the Northern Hemisphere or are we because this is confusing because this is the dust and when you see the dust that means that's the way the car is coming from that means that this car was driving on the left why would this car be driving left and why would that the Sun be South none of those make sense where would this make sense before driving left South Africa no Kenya maybe I'm him that's not an easy Kenya you had reason with the dust Japan because I think a lot of people go Brazil there but the dust means you're driving left so I just tell you guys whoa that's a cool I I you know kend I never commit Island there but respect okay this is where I get content wrong I feel like because Lord I want to go like in Italy I want to go like in Italy but my mind is saying listen bro it's just South Africa he said don't go Italy you silly goose you're going to embarrass yourself in front of approximately 30,000 people and that would not be a good look with this ever be in Italy is this wooden pole I don't think so I think I have to go zah here or am I smoking a z bad guess Wasa country streak three let's make it four probably not this is dude what am I doing oh Lord gota use my Noggin again got to use my Noggin and this is where candy I get maybe 500 points I'm not okay so my immediate first thought spot was is this ever like a northern Peru like a weird Peru I don't think this is Europe like where in Europe would make sense for this you know I'm blurry I'm sorry it doesn't look like Europe at all to me does it look like Asia maybe I think I just go Peru here keep it going keep it going don't talk about it keep it going okay don't talk about it keep keep going I made a couple good guesses today you can't that one guess doesn't Define me we'll have to we'll have to revisit that one okay let's do an Italy surely this is Italy right or is it ever Corsica it's never here right it's never here right surely it's here right not a good look so context clues in hindsight is that you go that we're facing this is the this is the back of the car yeah the dust driving right yeah I mean so this is the back of the car which means that so if you can't see the back of if you can't see the anten in Europe then it means it has to be pretty much turkey or like North mass or Serbia I honestly didn't think of North mass or Serbia here turkey does make sense this threw me off cuz this did not feel like European to me where the freak they're growing here I don't know left goes on you know I'm proud of my Kya guys honestly I'm proud of that Italy fine turkey that's not easy turkey in my opinion and I'll stand by that South Africa I honestly could see this being near estin so that's fine like I I maybe should have guessed more near Durban but I guess near like I should have went more East I think I think this would been a better guess than this but I don't think I would ever guess there but such as life let's keep doing the uh let's do the 10 second one now let me paste this and uh oh no we need to do 10 seconds you silly goose um you guys need a lock in don't want to pull an RC you know don't want to pull an RC so okay round one Grease just aens okay buddy this is Romania we have black and back at sign with his yellow thingies I'm going to do something like this just East okay really this down here North South Road super East okay okay is this Peru is this Argentina is this Chile it's chil it's Olivia I'm bad okay this is Sweden you know what I'm going to do here guys I'm going be honest I'm going do this I'm doing it I'm heding five countries here Sumi it worked out it worked out okay so listen let's talk about it have I had better days yes but if you go in every day thinking uh I'm going to come out Victorious you're thinking wrong cuz this happened this happens um yeah I played fine I played fine I I could see myself get a top 10 in both because I could see some country blunders in both but I'm excited to see how everyone else does but 16k on my 40 seconds is the lowest one I have yet and uh that's okay though that's okay normaliz is making bad guesses right guys let's see how our he does good luck all right looks like Kenya I think interesting mountains very cool and a big mountain in the back I don't know what that would be maybe like here somewhere or here somewhere it could be like these mountains I going to try that okay a little more south oh is that actually Mount Kenya we're looking at maybe interesting okay Japan it's not Switzerland right just got make sure I don't think so yeah this one is the one of the fourest locations of all time so I I do think it h no I don't know I was going to say it looks more Southern but I'm not sure like if I really wanted to go C I don't know if I can go C I'll go like here oh it's one of these islands that totally makes sense actually um I don't know I thought South Africa but it looks kind of weird it's kind of suspicious but I don't know what else would fit yeah I don't think it's don't think it's us so I guess I don't know I don't think it's a either so it's just somewhere around joerg just go there oh wow oh down here okay that's interesting maybe that's why it looked weird could really think of where it would be okay this is a tough one um I don't know like it looked like the balans when I first thought of it but I don't know it's a very weird one like it almost look like Albania or something but I I don't know no I'll just stick in Albania like something else I don't know really not sure turkey yeah okay Italy Sur where this one go here yeah I mean I something like this is fine I think think okay it literally look like s Marina so my bad no round no round one blenders no round one blenders lock in RC lock I got it I got it we're going dude listen you put on a clinic yesterday okay Greece okay no no round one blenders we in Greece uh I don't know it's like near borderline Athens yeah lock in is is this Romania I think it is actually I don't know it's thinking like here H it's oh yeah that's a tough one I looked Southern but I couldn't tell where is this uh I guess it is south of Gambia or is it yeah it's more this way okay wow probably chill chill or something but I don't know where let me actually go in the oh no it's Bolivia okay I didn't really it's this road this road looks so different like over here MH V guas it goes into the mountains that's crazy one of the baltics I don't know go okay yeah if you beat me I'll have you there last second maybe it's valid I went per all right decent atast I shoot I thought we were doing better man like we we had something going you know just just hit me while I'm down man hit me while I'm down all right thanks RC all right it's the next day let's see how everyone did oh Lord that isn't my worst day yet but you know it's literally just that one guess that's okay that is okay CU it played well other than that okay round one everyone gets Kenya not sure why I overthought the Kenya jhk the only one to almost commit the r Island he was hedging looks like four Islands there couple other people did get Island Vibes here and the Taiwan round three osca Spain trctor South by and Jacob get net a lot of people in kind of the same region I thought it was going to be this one is only three people got turkey aan and of course gelis which did win if you got turkey here you you pretty much win de Axel V and Mexico myself and Peru I used knowwhere to guess and in Argentina I thought it was rice they were growing there South Korea Thailand yeah lot people going Balkans here and then round five most people going Italy we'll take it all right and then the 10 second dude oh my God just not my day that's okay though save the snail coming first couple people getting near the right Road there coup people going on the same Ro as me most people going south of Gambia there everyone getting Grease must be looking Romania no one really going east Romania couple water Hedges here couple Sweden and uh some Baltic roulettes there but yeah not too bad gelous gets his first points South by gets his first points and Aman gets his fourth for for all right I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 0.2877819620800369, "lng":

right it's another day of some G here 40 seconds start the game let make some good guesses together shall we round one and maybe I should refas it so let's make some bad guesses together shall we I know you guys are thinking here let me make sure I'm not blurred I'm a little blurred let me fix some and focus okay I kind of want to go us here it looks like it could be like us Forest um you know could be svenia or something like that probably no I don't really see this being a Slovenian Forest I'm going to go like somewhere here in the US I think okay okay Annie are you okay are you okay Annie okay so immediately here it felt Dutch but you can see here to our North there's a freaking Hill so minus that cuz the highest that is not the highest elevation you would ever I mean so then it's like okay is it the UK potentially is it France or is it Belgium it's one of these could be Germany I could see Germany I think that's a French pole though actually in the back West is that a French Pole right here why do I talk like this is this a French pole it was a French pole round three if this isn't Sonia green blur it looks pretty green to me if isn't the green blur Sonia then you guys you know like kind of has to be no kind of has to be I'm feeling green looks like it could be a sonian road too what else good be could be like a Russia a western Russia it could be a obviously it could be a lva Lithuania but I'm feeling an Estonia more than I'm feeling anything else put me in coach I'm ready to play okay how about we don't this should surely be Southern Jordan right it's not across the border is it oh Lord am I going wrong country here I feel like if it was Israel you'd have the black and white stripe poles or the black and white striped on these lamps which means I would probably just go Jordan here it was I was on the 5K I'm throwing final round let's lock in and get a Sweden correct boom wait I didn't mean to cook that hard in that final round I didn't I didn't mean to do that but I did okay so this is pretty much an insanely boring seed insanely boring seed I don't know if I sent this to my friends so I'm going to do another one and I'm going to minus the 10-second one and do do two 40 second ones all right all right so let's get a less boring seed because I don't want to see my friends B bunch of Easy locations with hard or like a bunch of small countries it's boring okay this is more like we' like to see you know it's I'm all about the content you don't want easy rounds you know it's not very fun I got I want to use my nogin I want use my nogin okay why I feel like this could be the US this Finch feels your very like American why am I cooking on the northeast us today and this is another Sweden long Anana that looks like this vegetate is every Poland okay now we have to use our Noggin a little bit you know my first instinct here is Sweden because of the road feels a little Swedish to me vegetation feels like could be pretty Northern everything else it's never France uh could be like Southern France maybe no I don't I don't see this this fence being French um do I see this French being this fence being polish I could see a Poland here I think actually I'm think I'm leaning towards Poland if it's Sweden or something Northern then so be it but I think I like a Poland better it was a Poland it was I'm doing great all right this is surely irland actually do I ever go Isle of Man here I'm going to I'm going to do an Isis of man here I think it's Gen 2 makes sense okay Argentina okay North South Road in Argentina I I think I've gone like four days in run out where I've gone the UK on Ireland or the Ireland on UK we have a ridge to our West in Argentina I want to go near like Cordoba where do you get like a rid here West I don't think it's going to be the South though is a problem maybe here my best [Music] guess slightly more North I'm playing pretty well don't choke the last it's impossible to choke this okay this is another boring day I'm just going so be it you know sometimes you don't really have to use your nogin and that's okay I mean yeah I played great I played great today these us call outs were kind of good I I think I could see a lot of people going uh Europe and both of these us ones that's an L I lose how many points I lose in round three 700 that's actually not too bad round two I cooked round five boring round four kind of good I could win I could get at least top three I mean I could see myself being top three um I'm gonna do a 10-c one too just for fun though just to see what happens yeah this canaries okay here I am once again don't care about Syle oh this is a cool is this like Max South like down here like ever it was that red okay oh I go wrong continent it looks like Mexico is this ever Europe it's probably Europe we'll have to revisit that one we have to revisit that one we have to revisit that one where I mean 10 seconds I couldn't think I thought it was gen two and I thought this was a short plate could you tell that's a Chilean pole oh you definitely can tell that's a chain dude I can't see the uh the the emment is that the right word oh there's a chilian pole right here too oh man that's a blunder but I don't even care to be honest because I play great the rest of the day so yeah I mean that's a clear that's that's quite the blunder but that's okay I couldn't tell I thought that was a in the lighting I mean it's a cat but it doesn't look like it's indented here in my in my in my head it looks like it's like filled in um just a blunder but you can't win them all we'll see we'll see how everyone else does on this we had three seats today rather than two so okay this time our seat like lock in on the first round okay lock the first round no I don't remember what the first round is but you just have a bad history of first rounds in 10 second so yeah yeah okay oh no is it South Africa I don't know if I oh it's [ __ ] canaries how do you get canaries I don't understand looks like canaries um maybe this okay TI Nice Nice Guys Chile I think is this chill nice oh my God you got you're in third place and then it's just Bavaria I guess damn bro you were dude what dude first round bro wait wait wait go through your guesses again okay dude we have to get RC like a therapist for R1 10 seconds you got the road right okay on right okay got thead you got the intersection right okay the angle right okay got the island right and a road yeah basically and yeah yeah close enough and then and then you got Bavaria within like 100 like what the [ __ ] if only you learned that South Africa doesn't have white outer lines you'd be good what no we didn't have white did we actually oh yeah we did all right it's the next day good morning everyone hope everyone's having a great or good night I guess it's like 10: a.m. here took my tie class for the day time to record some daily challenges lots of people play today let's click them all get everyone up here 28 people that seems to be the standard lots of us going us that's good wait did no one go Europe on this that's actually kind of crazy that no one went Europe on this congrats to everyone this still baffles me why did bro know the forest jhk explain yourself round two the France I think yeah France dude Tricor does anyone have more consistent if bro gets the country right he gets the 5K like what is this guy on like his region guessing is insane okay like it's actually this guy's actually out of his mind um yeah but the French pole there helped me I don't know if it helped El I liked I did mention like Netherlands Belgium um UK makes sense with like the road but yeah everyone getting Europe there the green blur live and die by the green blur it's it's real CG great guess ground four where we looking where we looking where we looking and getting very close there in the South I'm surprised there's not more people on South makes sense round five this is just luck if I'm being honest I was just trying to be cool for the video and it ended up hanging off so we'll take that this one is the one that we're not counting scores on because this one is just it's just it all comes down to that us guess I don't like putting the weight of one seed on one guess and it's just boring I'm sorry like it's just this this doesn't really mean anything dude jhk how did bro know both forests how did this guy know both forests like lots of Europe guesses here and that's what I mean because if you look at any other guess like sure like the PO maybe I'm this is a crazy graph not many okay not people got pull in there great water hedge by jhk but I guess this not very many people got the country right actually I don't know why I'm coping so hard but here G lley Anna I guess this kind of a good seed lot people going to Brazil on AR here and trabot totic and debor getting the road Blinky going a little more south getting the road too and Sri Lanka

right since there day some Che guest here and today is a good day that we all make some good guesses no it's not Mexico Argentina Mt has to be Mexico where else would this vegetation look like this with this road I'm sorry I was quiet I had to lock in something like this maybe okay lock in okay Australia this is not look easy though where does it look like this I mean usually when you think of white soil sand rock you think of sa I don't think this is SA say I think it be like NW like in NW a little bit like freck oh no this is not good is that spiky boy ever no there Tasmania I could L see a Taz would a Taz be a horrible guess here n [ __ ] we ball let's go let's go that was a great last second like I thought I saw a spiky boy in the distance okay lock in lock in I have to go irand here it's Gen 2 with grass in the middle you guys you guys I have to ignore everything else because I see Gen 2 camera with grass in the middle and we all know what that means can you blame me can you blame me you can't okay on three four and it does not get easier dude oh my God dude this map is so freaking hard where are these Road lines on the side why are why are there white dashes on the side of the road here short white dashes this is never Sweden right this is never Sweden right do I trust this short white dashes because if without that it looked like it was going to be like Slovakia but where in Sweden would ever look like this nowhere but what else would that mean Estonia ever no it doesn't look it looks like something over here in like Eastern Europe I'm throwing so hard guys I have to trust it but I don't know no this doesn't look doesn't look like anything like Sweden why did I try and do that bro why did I try and do that why did I try and do that what were those what what was that road line doing there bro I guess it makes sense cuz Romania also has dashed outer lines but like I was thinking it could been like Slovakia Hungary I don't think like maybe could have reasoned with like a Bulgaria that is going to make me very very upset though [Music] like that's gon to make me so you have no I want to tilt so bad right now you have no idea how bad I want to tilt but I'm Gonna Keep It tame because I'm a professional and they let me cope for a bit here Sweden don't get me wrong you can guess shate me on this one Sweden's a horrible guess because I only saw those uh the the road lines this I probably go czechia or I don't go maybe I go Romania man I played so well in the in the beginning there that Taz last second Taz with the uh with the Mexico was kind of a good shout makes sense and you know makes sense this it's at the end of the day you can attribute it to one thing a skill issue it's a skill issue um the fact that my tiny Whittle brain would ever want to go Sweden on this it's a skill issue like where the [ __ ] would this ever make sense in Sweden bro and oh and a blunder the UK Ireland but that's just like you can't blame me that's fine I don't really care about that one um yeah I had two good guesses that was about it and I had G I had given up after that don't even asking about Japan this was embarrassing though probably a top 20 day again maybe top 15 we'll see H but let's just go ahead and do 10 seconds let me CAU me paste other one because I forgot to paste this okay what a frustrating frustrating frustrating thing to to happen there get content wrong don't really care to be honest like give me give me out my misery it's going be like Philly or something okay SAS May go Mani why am I popping the [ __ ] off right now and this is Sweden dude oh it's it's just going to taunt me it's going to taunt me I never go like yeah I say 236 on my first oh my god dude I mean that's the easiest SE in my life though ah dude I'm coping so hard you have know I don't think I've ever coped this hard this is a top three cope top three cope um but all right let's see how RC does all right RC it's time dude we missed you yesterday bro yeah well I had a fun time so I had a good nap so it's okay wait can I show the the screen your peanut yeah you can show the penut okay then you saw it try 5K or I can say yeah yeah no no they can they can they can comment where he took the photo yeah right all right start yeah you got this all right what the uh we have the front of the car it's like blue car you can kind of make out I think or is that the back no it looks like the front uh Mexico like here somewhere copyright one or 19 I don't even know I I'll leave it here I think I'm fine with that like yeah I don't know okay good it was Mexico at least we'll take that we'll take that oh this is interesting like I was wondering if it could be Tasmania yeah I don't know it's very white soil I don't know if it works maybe do I go for Tania I don't know it could just be like here somewhere I feel like but I'll keep it in okay good good RC lock the [ __ ] in lock in RC lock nice guess by the way lock in yeah I don't know if it's like UK or something I guess maybe with like the fence oh yeah and that looks quite like UK or Ireland I think I don't really want to go Ireland though I feel like it's more UK if anything um yeah I'm just going to go like here maybe like that edge slightly towards Island and Wales as well shopshire Hills is lowkey the right area anyways okay we take that RC lock the [ __ ] in first place dude first place sorry lock in lock in lock in um he's Romanian okay what is this what is this uh oh we have dashes I should didn't even notice that could it be no it wouldn't be France what would it be what would have dashes like that the validation I needed uh be Slovenia Sweden I think I might just go like Slovenia or something what else Romania I guess could have it yeah it was Romania I should have gone Romania you're still first you're still first you're still first okay can't really make out to play and the pole doesn't really have anything that I recognize but it looks kind of More Southern I would say we have like uh little grass thingies do I ever go cuu or do I just just hedge kind of more Central like aama maybe I don't know I do kind of see I could see cuu so I'm going to head shikoku in between the two I think we'll take that okay that's fine that's fine we'll take that RC that's first place we take that we'll take we got first place all right that's first place all right that was not the easiest seed I think no no you had to use your nogin okay good luck we're good we're good if it'll load God 5 Seconds what is this bro what I actually don't know what this is it's like or something no I was Uganda D I thought about why did I not send Uganda okay you got first another one bro you're allowed to blender and your screen didn't load my screen didn't load bro it's I'm in Kenya no no I'm mean in the first round I'm helping you get it re you're in Kenya I thought you're in the US is that why you couldn't record yesterday yes I was in Kenya yesterday is this Cola no I don't know if it's Cola but I'll just go there anyways imagine imagine if BR learn Uganda yeah imagine no I'm just kidding what is this like a Manny Sask or something okay nice and then it's like seems like a free 24K for someone like yeah I don't know where exactly to go on I kind of want to go more South to be honest oh you clicked the 5K didn't regge yeah that's all right I should have gotten Uganda though I was thinking about uh yeah I mean you still did pretty well for getting zero points on round one with they will enjoy this one F show yeah and your peanut my peanut also great hoodie you're wearing in that show though yeah brein okay um all right thanks RC all right it's another day let's see how I did on this one this was the 42nd one I got nine top 10 on this horrible Sweden guess I will take I don't deserve it RC coming in first place shout out to him um 25 people playing let's go round one what happened Mexico lot people G Mexico couple Colo couple uh Europe there we got Germany Slovenia Crow couple Us's um I mentioned Columbia I could say Columbia but at the end Mexico great guest by my and South by round two Tasmania zigzag I don't know who AV heard that is Jacob RC myself Deb with a water hedge to pic and saoto going Southern Vic getting good points a couple wall guesses over here with Linley snil and Chum and some essay guesses which I think makes s sense too but okay this was oh I'm surprised more people didn't go UK here and I'm also surprised no went Ireland with me I'm like dark that's fine um that's pretty funny that's that's cool a lot of people going France Northern Spain Belgium Lux okay tricker great guess great guest tror let's go round four we got a Romania this is uh yeah I don't expect anyone to be in Sweden with me okay some great validation here in Norway with Snell and totic both great players thank you for that couple czechia Slovakia Hungary the this kind of the region I was thinking I could see Bulgaria so like these guesses too and obviously and trior where did trior Place 11th what happened to trior brother great guesses uh Japan I just yeah give up okay and then the 10- second one I ended up winning so that's nice I guess that's a little bit of a kind of a um little validation for you let's see what happened here Colo L people going uh Asia and Colo which kind of makes sense Mexico uh round two everyone in Kenya round three that Colo round four matoba round one aana and some yeah poor RC man he just wasn't locked in it's all okay it's all good he got first place and when it mattered in Sweden all right Southern there RC getting seven points zigzag getting 10 points and bag getting one point or six points I should say that for all right I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations":

closest to Argentina wins as you can see here um everyone gain the road I think this is there most people gain 40 it's a pretty long road though let's be honest with ourselves it's uh it's probably like 5,000 kmet long so you can get the road but you can also get the road and get zero points so um yeah kind of comes up comes down to that most everyone getting Borneo Saba the hills shot to save

the heck with this I I I'm going to go like Western Minnesota I think it's never Canada I don't think never see us being Canada North Dakota North Dakota does have snow coverage now you know probably most countries do but I just can't be asked a very fun Argentina and why do I want to go super North there that would be a horrible guess if I went North because it looks so weird look like Paraguay border for some reason but like I don't know it looked like Paraguay bordered to me I'm going to commit do I even commit this road right here like just max commit the road bad guess bad guess bad guess what are you gonna do about it next round never bot Swan it's just North Peru right just North Peru right it's like up here never North Colo right never North Colo right never North Colo right

yeah that's so happens cuz my internet is so slow okay snow I think it's us not Canada and I there's a lot of snow in like Eastern North Dakota so that was like my first thought could be over the border of Minnesota there's a bit snow there as well but yeah I think I'm going to go here lock the [ __ ] RC let's go come on you can do this black car so I think it's arge and it's like one of those toss like P or Santiago dester it's always one of the two I think on this one I'd rather go although it's very North South or like East West which is like kind of a laop I think I might go here actually I'm going do that okay what no that's misplaced like these are fine guesses even Cho is fine what um are you calling Trot cheater uh trota let's do a skill test after this is this uh Peru it looks like tus like a I think the pole might be so I was thinking like here oh my I for record your audio I'm kidding oh my God I'm kidding okay broo really got me scared on that one okay okay what's how many points behind are you right now I don't know I'm not in top five though okay I'll take one guess come on okay I know this country it's Ghana I I won't not yeah okay it's sure it's not Santa Cruz yeah um can I get the road probably not I think I'm just going to go like here I kind like this ah dude Kumasi hedgers dirty bro it's dirty it's all it is just dirty oh man okay so I was thinking

here that's in the Kazan guesses um interesting but I respect it you got to respect it looks like Germany um as for where I don't know I'll go uh it kind of reminds me of bavar oh [ __ ] it's Luxembourg okay I always forget about Luxembourg Jordan I think like around here somewhere more North Manitoba this one is kind of Northern low key maybe this red or okay okay that's what we like to

right we're back with another day of some day here and today is a good day you want to know why it's a good day because I know this road it's a boring Road actually in Denmark but luckily I do know it um it's going to be this this yellow Road right here right in the northern Denmark you can tell it's this road because of uh the way it looks was it wait was it actually that road wait wait it was actually the 13 yeah see I see see see see you know um you know I know my roads you know um you know if you ever need to learn new Danish Road just let me know guys I'm the the man to go to um specifically if you want to know like Taiwan um and this is going sound crazy but does this does anyone know if this place has Gen 4 cover because this does not look like Taiwan but it's Taiwan you know which makes you think it's like here or like one of these islands over here but I don't know if these have Gen 4 so I'm not going that that that far but I think I'm just going to go penu it was penu okay round three don't choke it oh Lord have mercy my soul Lord have mercy I cannot believe that was a 13 ink that's actually hilarious okay bro new the road this is this is me um what's the word when you're trying to avoid something this is me avoiding making region gu here and what I don't know if it's caner or the US to be honest like it's not it's like something like Montana North Dakota Sask Alber like one of the like I'm go more South like something like to try Montana North Dakota South Dakota Border close I'm closing my eyes I'm closing my eyes I'm going to open my eyes in three two one if I'm disappointed you win some you win some you lose some surely this is just Northeast Romania right we have the Chad flag there though actually so it might be like downtown like something like here makes sense yeah I think so just um I think you guys like that joke is that funny okay you guys don't get the joke they have uh similar flag colors that was a joke I think this is like Northeast Romania something like this I I don't know though I don't know it's GNA be something like any it could be anything sure dude I just need to like I just need to learn the US is this Norway like a Bergen ever is my best guess here oh is this like a my first instinct was Norway do I have to stick with it what else could it be it looks like it could be like something like this what else could it be Trevor what else could it be be I don't know if it could be anything else is is it ever like a no it's this like it it could be it could be somewhere else in Norway I think but I'm just GNA have to go like here am I throwing I don't know if I'm throwing one day I'll make a good us guess I believe okay so where do you be where do you win I mean it's this everyone gets Pingu here I think I don't think anyone like some people probably go Mainland because they just don't freaking think about it like it looks like a high score but there's very marginal there's a lot of room everyone gets where's I lost my most points in round three where did yeah yeah I I get top 10 I don't get top three that's where we're at right now for sure for sure for sure all right well I don't know if RC is goingon to be available we have a tney in like an hour and I need to record this real quick but we'll see we'll see who's available we'll see who's available Denmark region guessing Denmark uh I don't know there's some interesting trees over there I was thinking like Mainland probably like this maybe possibly something up here actually there's a one way Road I think this probably find yeah I was thinking yeah if I really wanted to cook I would go here but I don't know if I want to cook like that do I want to cook like that a [ __ ] it it's Mar I'll cook okay that's pretty good okay Taiwan is it I think it is it's got to be pengu right it's got to be RC zooms into pangu will pay off 26 seconds off 26 seconds on the clock is it ever this I don't know I'll just hedge middle dude I I still have flashbacks to the to the Montana we had yesterday Montana rent free 20 seconds it's not Montana right surely it's not Montana I don't I kind of want to go Mont but it's like literally the same place near either it's not Montana watch just like Colorado this time or something dude of course yeah see that's where I kind of sent last time like I sent Colorado like Montana rent free bro rent free is living rent free in my head okay we have a Romania it's Southern it's probably not too far from Bucharest so where do I want to go do I want to go more East or West I think slightly East like here we go there okay I think can it be something else this kind of feels like Norway doesn't it like you got to send ever like Stockholm area guess it's possible but I want to stay nor I want to stay like here okay that's fine yeah unun us Montana all right it's the next day let's see how we did um um unfortunately I do not know what the US looks like so let's see how everyone else did and refresh the page hoping for at least a top 10 at least Lenley first place Anna trabot sixth place not too bad 25 people playing let's go ahead and look through the scores here go ahead and look through the scores shall we all right let's go and start round one though everyone getting Demar RC making the good the good guess I don't know this was this that was just luck on my end guys that was luck is when opportunity meet skill Taiwan most people a lot of people G Pingu I don't hate this guess over here I don't know if that has Gen 4 that's the only thing I'm assuming it does if that many people guess there um and then some Taiwan guesses there everyone getting Taiwan though so that's good this is it wow bunch of good guesses here A bunch of people up here in South and North Dakota with me bunch of really good names up here RC's a little rent free with Montana and we have some good Kansas guest or this is Nebraska so Anna G sh Jami Gorka Deb sorry Deb never mind uh Linley and then JK game close there in Colorado that makes sense round four Romania action great guess by Lindley good Lord Brother great guess people going in the same region as me up here everyone going east for the most part and round five the only reason why I know what Bergen area looks like so much is cuz like over a year ago I was making a Tik Tok trying to find the road from a kago music video um I I I stopped talking for a second because I remember harmless a Norwegian was pronounced one day he pronounced Kao like kigo or something I was like bro what the [ __ ] is this guy talking about anyways and it was in Bergen and so I literally maybe looked at like over a thousand roads in this area but anyways everyone getting from this part so not too bad of a day and getting 10 points trabot getting 10 points oh man and Anna wait no Linley or Anna Troy gets nine and Anna gets two listen I know I saw I keep get comments are like rainbow you can do it this way you can do listen you guys want me to be a freaking nerd on no all right another day hopefully one Happy New Year's everyone it's New Year's Eve here it's currently 10: a.m. on 31st shout out to the Pistons go get yourself some

right we're back with another day of some jesser today's going to be a good day I can feel it I can feel it coming in the air tonight okay now we actually oh Lord 202 copyright oh Lord okay we can't see the front of the car it's not us it's going be Europe oh Lord please why can I not just had like a very fun day of just ploning in Japan and getting a good score I actually have to okay can be Germany with 2021 is it ever like the Netherlands or Belgium or is this like an Austria Slovenia Belgium I kind of like Belgium or Netherlands Belgium what is this Forest dude this is this I dude I'm not guys you can't you can't blame me for not getting this right okay guys like I'm really really trying my hardest out here was France you can give me like some Kudos on that one though I went Belgium on France like that's a fine that's a fine guess 400 points on that but the thing is is where like where else do you guess there I don't think you guess anywhere else you know that's the thing we'll probably see a bunch of different guesses but for me my head Belgium Netherlands France were the only ones that made sense it looked like Germany but it was 2023 copyright or 2021 copyright you can't get that in Germany or 2021 copyright in Germany because it's only 2023 um not low cam maybe you go in Austria Slovenia you probably still get close maybe you go I don't know anyways oh man Lord this really tested me today tested my strength today man that's all I gotta say that's all I gota say 15 seconds I thought it was Thailand I let to go Thailand here I hope you guys understand that if I get bad cat bad guess it doesn't I'm Still Human After All and AIS Dustin one neray what is this sign what is that sign can I is this Texas pavement what is that sign brother oh man I'm really my heart rate right now because I'm playing like decently well for like the seed I feel like but like I'm going to blunder Texas pavement this grany pavement looks Texan looks North inish that was an insane seed from start to finish um that was a really fun I like those because you you have to think those are fun man I mean I did well guys I did well I kind of just gave up on the last round because I was kind of over it you know I don't know where I would guess that would be distinct I mean yeah maybe with these Hills I should have got more East all right now you guys know what time it is it's time to cope and let's see what I could have done better here dude this is such Texas pavement bro it's a cope what is this sign though oh dude you know what I'm just blind for the longest time I thought this was uh like black and white and I was like why is it striped I was like why is it striped bro no this is a Gable Montana for sure for sure for sure and it's a skill she on my end but what are you going to do about it man what are you going to do about it this will be a great seed for RC to play a great seed because he's great at the US and he can ma in the two uh other countries that we had that were difficult but man all right that was a fun day you know I didn't play the best I played okay for the these were insanely tough rounds I don't think people understand how hard rounds are but these were some tough rounds and I'm I'm a bad us guess but all in all I'm proud of myself so let's see how um let's see how RC does you got sound sound on sounds on sounds on sounds on okay desktop audio is moving all right all right blink mode okay I mean I don't know where exactly yeah I don't know okay take that maybe what else could it be I guess could be like here as well I kind of like a Bas absolute Bas somewhere yeah I'll leave it I'll leave it here okay wow I mean that's pretty tough this one's interesting is this like here something maybe I'll go here okay yeah good move RC can win here if he knows this let's see where he goes talk to us I don't I don't recognize um I thought us I guess but the hill is weird sing like I don't know maybe that hope it's not Mex okay I have Montana Dam uh yeah this one second like here somewhere maybe no it's more south damn it started off strong yeah same I mean it wasn't I beat me what the [ __ ] what was your score oh my God I like 50 points yeah tough us not the easiest Brazil yeah I look like got all the countries right all right it's the next day and let's see how everyone did I'm hoping for as always a top 10 obviously top three to get points would be nice but I'm very interested in seeing 12th oh so many people played though we had some this was a doozy man this was a doozy if you guys get over like 5,000 points on this so like give yourself a pat on the back I look at that bro these are pro players like these are some of the best players in the world okay that's an insane screenshot all right everyone G Japan dude what sucks is I was like in first place after three rounds and I just through all right round two let's go two Us's yeah I thought about us but if you guys want like a tip it's uh you can't see in the us the Google Street View cards in the you can see the front of the car in on street view and then Europe you can see the back um give or take but this one we were looking forward and we couldn't see the front of the car so it couldn't have been um the US fun fact if you went us there it's okay who's in Belgium with me Blinky saado that's Eddie or someone Toro and Dan bunch of UK here makes sense snail getting first place with a little water head Edge okay save the snow all right um yeah no one going Germany we all know copyright Russia check yeah most people game France Belgium kind of this region couple us interesting though interesting this one we had some Mexico and the Thailand one we had some Mexico dude look at I have the best guess here I had the best guess in Japan and Thailand bro cope round four which one is this oh The Mont Han CG and Dan getting Montana Lenley going Washington a lot of people going north here though and that was the Do or Die Here unfortunately lots of people in the south of me in Texas you can't get mad you can't be mad at it that's my downfall right there is around five and just the Brazil here I just kind of yeah token teens I just pled get me out of this I could have like the difference between 12th and six was like 600 points so like if I got 2,900 points I just like click here it's yeah anyways whatever another day another despair no that's that's that's fun it's fun but this is a this ISS a lot right here this ISS a lot but all right let's update the let's update the score sheet today all right snail gets

right we're back with another day of some gser and hopefully I do well today and I make my oh there's a is this a yellow plate I was going to say this looks like Columbia I'm just going to do Colombia some people might have an advantage because I could see a slight yellow right there but it looks like one of these I feel like I've seen coverage like this down here like Southern Columbia down here so I'm going to go like right here I should just click this Center bro this Ghana Ghana it feels Coastal like it could be like a cape Coast I really like a cape Coast call out thinking are we driving right why it make sense driving right absolutely nowhere it's definitely Gana I'm going Cape I'm going like even more West actually like something like this all right I can pick up some big points in Brazil a dude I hate reion I should like spend like three days and learn how region gasana that looked so Coastal to me though like the Lush Greenery all right Northeast Brazil can we do it I might just go P or like something like something like carara yesterday was carara and didn't really look like this though maybe a mirr now Al I know my pration of these is bad I'm just going to go like a p something a hedge like this not bad 3,500 points is horrible holy dooo is this a BC I think BC is a good guess I kind only go northern BC though is that a risky a little risky little risky or do I go I mean is it ever like a c or like a Colorado or something I don't think so I think a BC here with these trees like the trees feel more Northern to me I don't think you would get get these in like Colorado or like anything like Montana you can feel something like this like low key like I don't know what Prince I don't I I I need to look at Canada again but I feel like something like this would make sense I'm going to H you a little bit more south just in case it's like something dude I'm gonna pout if I go Sakia on cheia you guys just go ahead and if I if this is Slovakia then literally you guys should just never watch me play jius ever again I think and I just don't deserve the right to make a guess in um a public setting ever again I don't think can I get a 20K today or I break the streak actually I think I got 18K one day where I went South AF or I Miss South Africa as a continent but if this is Slovakia he's him you know it's not about how you start it's about how you finish but unfortunately this scenario it's about kind of how you started and finished horrible G guess six out of 10 Brazil guess four out of 10 uh Kumbia guess because you click Center and get a good score maybe a three out of 10 BC guess but we got the check yeah okay you know that's okay that's okay let's see how RC does bro has no car on as from the road insert nerd OTE what wait no no no no zoom in zoom in zoom in zoom in you got wait wait what no wait no no no no no wa zoom in again bro you almost 5K what the hell damn um yeah I mean I forgot to record your audio that's okay I record your screen bro what this is so scuffed okay is it I'm just talking to myself this whole yeah I'll go like uh over here somewhere I don't know maybe I don't know middle hedge is probably best okay damn dude you really brought it back there yeah I really brought it back dude you had such you almost beat me oh my God oh my God you played great one one guess doesn't Define you RC I hope you know that one guess does not define but you know it does Define you one guess and that one guess is the BC guess that defines you not the G gu yeah one guess defines me all right that was crazy all right it's next morning and I'm going to do this quick because quite frankly I want to go watch the rest to this Pistons game um let's see how we did fungus first place Jami second place and my teammate save the freaking snail in third place with a horrible Brazil guess that mean he must have popped out popped off elsewhere all right let's see how we did ninth another day of top 10 you know you can't really complain too much with the amount of talent we have in this in this line up you know what to say right hard work beats Talent when Talent refuses to work hard all right everyone getting Colo I think totic is on a small screen he didn't see the the yellow plate there round two what happened here oh yeah we don't we don't we don't see the RC Colo this four people saw the caranda on the front of the car there and when guat over Ghana and look at this t on getting the right Road okay to totic No One everyone going south South with me but no one going that Coastal I'm just bad um but least didn't go Columbia okay yeah a bunch of Brazil guses here couple Colo Northern Peru uh any geta RC did it's p did uh bag did maam did fun didn't and then round four oh the BC guess this right here bro that

right we're back with another day of some daily Geer today I hope we uh hope we play well today is this the Philippines it is the Philippines we have white Gen 4 I think this is a Philly pole oh why does it look like this is this ever palan like what is this no I'm just going to go like pan I mean just get a sio seu hedge will do it for you this is not too bad only 500 points around one we're goingon to be in like SAS or Manny right now I L like a Manny Manny here I don't know the poles if I'm being honest like the difference between the poles um this road kind of feels more Manny to me and it feels more like something like this I could see a Sask I could lowy see an albera too but I'm more than likely I most like I more I most like I'm blurred too I most like a Manitoba and it was Manitoba okay and we're going to be in Brazil I mean this is goingon to be pretty North Focus Trevor oh guys I'm sorry you get blurry camera I can't there's no retakes all right this going to be Northern Brazil now this camera got me all like confused okay I got lock in yeah I'm going to go like pwi something like this uh pretty North not bad it was Siara that makes sense the Shrubbery voses dawon oh Lord oh man I'm going around content is this Mexico yo I think I might like Mexico what is this bro oh Lord my Noggin is saking hell it's definitely not like European ever like it could be like if this was white like if this car wasn't visible I could see going like Southwest turkey these trees right H it could be like an arch or like a a Peru maybe I have to go Mexico I don't know what else it could be go like something like this please Lord please Lord how's it that North how's it that North yeah I'm about to have like Mass amounts of copium after that one that isn't like I it's just a skill issue at the end of the day that's just a skill issue um it's just a skill issue I got Mexico but do I ever go north here okay let's let's think with an open mind rainbolt let's think with an open mind what makes you go north here I I can't do it I don't know I'm just I'm just bad that's just a skill isue this doesn't look North either bro what is this is this a this the only coverage I have on this road this car right here has to be distinct like I guarantee you this RC nerd definitely call some like crazy [ __ ] out you didn't know that the the saturated blue Gen 4 car in northern Mexico like okay buddy all right enough coping that was uh maybe maybe a top three coping moment of my my what did I at least get wait it's that wasn't the last round Oh I thought that was the last round oh Lord okay we have a Colo though so this makes it easier just go just go in the andies here somewhere in capital um D I thought that was a final round I coped way too early okay I played fine guys I was blur the whole game um I played fine I like listen what are you going to do about that that's not first of all I don't even think that's an easy Mexico I can see some people not going to Mexico there where do they go besides Mexico I don't know to be honest but uh uh like four out of five guesses again were kind of spoton like I got the Manny call out I got the Colo Northeast Brazil is a great guest there Central Philippines I almost want to go palan but I didn't know where to go so I just clicked middle you can't be you can't be too upset with this you can't be too upset I I'm very interested to see who goes north Mexico maybe I'm just bad I'm probably just bad but we'll see all right it's the next day let's see how I did I want to know if anyone got Northern Mex go here that's all I want to know wow what happened round one Philly Gen 4 white car makes sense couple in toi there it happens round two most of us getting Manny couple Alberta too crazy there what happened anyone get a good guess here round one getting no round three leny with the insane guess this is the only reason why I got a good score here was because my Brazil guess I think four a couple Arch makes sense I think called AR Greece turkey and look at this right here I mean you deserve to win right here like troden trctor that's a great guess that's a great guess he all of us South and then round five little Colo action pretty standard day I think across the board I'll take second place um but yeah shout out to De oh wow I was only 120 points away from first place today but you know very very marginal score difference but we will take it let me know if you guys got um above like I would say getting above like 12,000 if you're a new player on the seed would be really good honestly so let me know how you guys did and uh I'll see you guys tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 6.319267526639335, "lng": -74.9505444140275}, {"round": 2, "lat": 49.178236725140515, "lng":

back with another day of some daily Geer because what's another day without another daily video oh this is a us we haven't had us in a while I don't feel like these trees feel Southern they don't feel like Northern Pines they feel like Southern Pines not too South so I'm going to go like South Carolina or something maybe like a no not like a Kentucky or something near like West Virginia I think makes sense Tennessee something like this is good maybe even in Georgia like something it's not every Georgia let like Tennessee here it was South Carolina that's getable I think I might have even mentioned South Carolina this is mainland malay we have the black sticker there feels like it's going to be like there's like water nearby you know I just get that feeling here I get that feeling with the trees and like the sandiness so I'm going to do something like this so North not a bad guess though this is indo this looks like it could be like I want to go like samatra if like West so much is there a pole yeah I want to get samatra here maybe reality yeah okay it was West samatra I called it but I didn't commit it so it doesn't count and this is Greece northern Greece ever with a yellow sign there wait is this over like North Macedonia or something or Serbia actually I might want to do North Mass like I'm just going to go north Mass border because we don't have Anana but I don't know it could be it's probably just gree it was North Mass okay country streak right we'll take that and then the Philippines and surely I go Southern here right I'm doing really well again so far but Sur I go Southern here right there's so many palm trees but it's also so flat do I just do seu do I just do a seu I'm just hedging a seu Dev a good score though a good score all things around where did I mess up I played pretty well I played pretty well it's beatable though it's beatable it's actually pretty beatable you get a South Carolina that's like a 800 points there I really like my Westra call out or reality but most people I think going to get that with the oil Palms Malaysia I kind of went Center and you beat me on Philly I think it's top 10 it could be a world where that's placement I don't think so but we'll see but all in all not too many blunders here got North Mass most people are going to get that so time will tell but we'll see okay so I'm literally editing this right now just rewatched the video to see how I did dude I called the South Carolina guess I then called West samatra and then I then called Deval I should just start going to my first instinct because the the score I could have gotten here would have been like a 24K if I just trusted my instinct I literally call West samatra Deval and Carolina in the first like 10 seconds of each round but all right that's enough coping never miss a day obviously okay we got some Southern reflectors that's what we like to see no rumble strips whatsoever that is interesting I don't know I think my first thought was like South Carolina could even be Georgia low key but think I might just stick it in South Carolina and see hey yo AO what nothing what are you AO Wing me for yeah I'll just uh go like here okay okay okay what's a southern reflector Sun reflector are those like reflectors that stick out looks like we got a black sticker some lots of Sumatra ponds which is interesting looky makes me want to go closer to simatra um we also have like coconut pops and stuff maybe it's like up here maybe like I lowkey want to go like ketta do I go ketta no okay well kanton I'm not getting that so that's fine white car again but I think this one's Indo I mean we have oil pawns and I feel like I would rather go Sumatra on this than cie I'm going to go like max out three or do I want to go Sumatra okay okay that that works West Sumatra is actually kind of tough to get there and then we have no antenna so I guess North Macedonia probably I don't really know I think it's Central HED is fine okays yeah yeah yeah we have a ton of Palms but it's like very flat I guess you a little bit of mountains north kind of reminds me of like the Eastern islands like even men now down here maybe it's possible yeah I'm just going to I'm just going to hedge it like over here and hope it's good ah it was men now that's a tough one I feel like no I threw with that I think yeah damn Ah that's unfortunate youing bro I was I was all right it's next day as usual and I don't think I got the top 10 today unfortunately but we'll see definitely didn't get placement but everyone do holy [ __ ] how is that score I got 13th that's actually insane it's actually insane like these people are cracked okay West samatra lot people getting couple people going Borneo makes sense couple people going Malaysia that also makes sense I go around by round here oh dude I'm such a loser okay round two everyone getting Borneo of or mainland of course because of the sticker I have I have the average guess there I would say most everyone getting North Mass couple Ser couple Greece just weird Blinky you're just weird bro it's just weird just weird man just a weird little fella Philippines who did this is that is that Harrier J mby okay Jami I see you any any other really good guesses I mean that's just uh that was an insane game from a lot of people you know granted tomorrow I'm going to trust my instinct more okay all right Pike it's three leny gets two is L on here he is he has five l no l gets one and snail gets two all right let's look at the squirt not too shabby not too shabby well let's see if tomorrow is a

right we're back it's another day of the daily Challenge Series where every single day I put a link in the description you guys play today and I play as well so you guys have to play before I play because or it's spoiled or you don't have to play you can just watch me guess if you don't want to play that's okay too Merry Christmas to everyone um hope that today everyone has a great day full of family or friends or family and friends or Geer three things in life that you you should have at least one of the three you know today I have Geer with me you know it's all about finding something in a a small win in the day you know I hope everyone can find that wi for them today you know regardless of how big or small that is this looks like Borneo Saba um I think and kind of a hill so I'm going to go like right here little more south but you know all things here will take it little Sweden oh is this Estonia I think I might rip in Estonia here it feels more Estonian than do Sweden so the reason why I say that is because it's uh I mean you get the double white the short short dashed outer lines in both but um this looks this this would be a weird Sweden I feel like it would be Southern Sweden so we would still really lose that many points but I feel like it could even be island like aonian Island but um it's just Mainland there and it's just outside talin laah laah action Sun North hemisphere South uh but the antenna is weird because it looks like you're driving right but we're not we're should be driving left it looks like it's going to be somewhere like over here in Petoria like something like this region right here again there's small Hills North um but yeah you know so far I'm doing pretty good I've only lost 600 points off the the seed so far so it's nothing to fret over I think I just go pretty close to Victoria again here that's a great guess again I'm playing pretty well right now hopefully I don't choke these last two seeds hopefully I really don't and we're goingon to be back in Z we're going to be back inside I feel like this is kind of the similar region you know this grass right here does kind of feel like more Northern can't see too many Hills in the South there maybe it's closer to like a Derman this time like more Coastal is I could see uh or like closer to the m border ever like something like this I could see maybe I can't see any elevation at all so I I I'm kind of guessing just off the trees here yeah I'm going to go with like a Newcastle guess dude I'm playing really well right now and I hope it doesn't come down to round five and I choke it cuz this is a great seed it's I'm playing very very well oh Lord this Russia is is this Eastern Russia why is this vegetation feel Eastern I feel like it could be like one of these roads over here but I'm going to go west and if on if it's one of those roads over there that's just unfortunate it could not even be Russia I don't know what this Forest is bro it's a goddamn Christmas miracle that is my PB on this map I literally think that's my PB on this map that's my PB on this map it was 235 before on npz I don't see how anyone could beat that score with how I just played maybe like I I have to get placement today surely that was like maybe I'm Hoying myself up a little too much here but that was a really good game that was a really good I switched last second from Eastern Russia because it was black car and I just didn't know where else to go that was great that looked extremely scripted but we'll take it I'm going to talk my now and see if RC wants to try and beat this or someone wants to try and beat this but and if not I'll check back in tomorrow and see how we place but that is a win a Christmas miracle that's what that's actually Miracle on maps Miracle on Ice no Miracle on maps lock the in let's go I'll just say this if you beat my score today every single person watching this video has to subscribe to you on YouTube right now and I'll put a massive link and a 20-minute promotion at the end of the video if you beat my score today okay I'm going here somewhere hope it's not Mainland yeah I don't know okay good good I think that's a good start I don't know if you got that I did get that okay okay not that close but you know I was in SAA okay okay that's what we like to hear is this Estonia I feel like it is cuz it Doesn't I don't know I mean yeah I don't know I'd rather go ston Sweden on this I don't know why my thing is being laggy uh yeah I don't know I was vibing with like this area over here but uh it's a a little bit of a tough one I need need to turn on my South Africa scripts again you know I don't know I'll I'll keep it here okay okay wait wait wait B it's not where are you up right now you're up okay you're up you're up a bit I'm up a bit okay okay this one is a interesting one I feel like you just have to go Tober again like I don't know doesn't seem that strange so you probably just go same area honestly is it ever like blond fontain that's the question maybe I I'm going to SL South here o bro why why are you going here that okay wait I don't know how I'm no I'm saying I don't know how you got it lock in lock in lock in you can beat me here and then h is it just Russia like I think that's a black car right or is it like Slovakia or something that's the question huh I don't know yeah I was thinking like here somewhere what else is possible I guess yeah Slovakia maybe Poland oh my God why is it there I thought it was like hilly okay GG's all right it's the next day I'm going to refresh the page and hopefully I'm still top one I got first that's the only thing I would ever really want on a Christmas morning so let's see oh baby we've done it we've actually done it well yeah all right got some people playing here let's see how they did round one Borio guessers rise up round two Estonian truther is over here trctor de RC jhk and trota round three loah action laah ooh great gu wolf wow uh yeah everyone kind of go Victoria makes sense round four yeah I can kind of P region I kind of H more south but I think Anna and dusk's guess makes sense there or whoever that is and then round five the one that broke the STW that broke the Cam's back the card did look kind of red long antana Poland does make sense apparently a lot of people thought this region because it was hilly makes s but when in doubt Moscow out and we'll take the dub all right rainbolt gets eight trctor gets seven and jjk gets four Merry Christmas ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -28.7964026339404, "lng":

nsw I think but like I think Vic's a good guess here to be honest something like this or shepperton it's fine it's fine just melbour oh man dude I was hoping we get like a free like you know like something with like Clues wait what is this pull I thought this was Indo but now we look at this pole and this looks like a Brazilian like Southern Brazil pole and now I'm like really confused cuz where the heck would this make sense in south Brazil it's not a li do I have to go Java or something if this is Southern Brazil guys I'm retiring think you ever get those plants in Brazil where do I go here I don't know where to go syi Philippines dude oh my god dude what is I'm like what is the sced this is Philly surely well let's go this this is never L am I'm just going to feel I'm not I'm I'm not overthinking it's the Val like okay like bro got lost if I just switch my guesses I'm like the actual goat I'm lucky all right listen guys now every day is a good day actually every day is a good day not every day is a great day today wasn't a great day but we'll see not my best not my best score but also not the worst you know I could have went like l am. i could have went Colo listen Indo Philly happens okay but we'll see how um how everyone else did not I'm not proud of it though I'm not proud of it but we'll see we'll see okay buddy would you read it was a promise name on the buet whates yeah in Japanese yeah yeah it's always that that's crazy dude what what are you doing bro like what are you doing here how did you get that road right what the [ __ ] was that like I know you wanted to be on I'm not hedging so I hedged a bit more and that lined up too shito Australia yeah e oh [ __ ] oh we have a pull actually should be Philly then where do I go there's no way anyone can reg guess this okay okay bro I guess it's just okay oh [ __ ] are we back think so unless it's like some weird in Malay Sur not it's your same place damn it was South how how does anyone get that like what I went Indo and phly and pH on Indo like I'm just bad all right it's the next day you guys know the Vibes um yeah I mean this was not the best day of your boy if I switch my guesses on both rounds I get like at least a I get at least a 20 23k um I started the game really good but it's no cigar so I definitely got 15 to 20th today not this will be my my worst worst uh ranking yet for sure yeah 17th we're we're down we're down here on the bottom but there's also some pretty good names down here so you know not every day can be a good a good day like I said um but JJ put linky so oh my Lord okay we're G have to go round by round we're get Japan obviously uh valid col everyone going east of Andes there for the most part couple EA one Peru uh couple going up there one next orwat not too bad round three I think this is uh yeah everyone getting kind of the same region most people Vic and this is where it gets spicy dude I just [ __ ] up my why did I go indo there bro like I just fumbled that so hard bro and you know what I like I just I didn't even realiz this was an endo pole I was so caught up on that being like a Brazilian pole for some reason I didn't even think about it but such as life you know if you if you if you always you know if it was no one goes into here wait what okay everyone else went Philly on this one so I really only messed up round four I would say base delicious water gas I must say yeah I mean this is a this is quite the validation here JT is three J get two link get one Merry Christmas by the everyone or Merry Christmas Eve it's 24th here I'm recording this all right Blinky takes the lead again all right well hopefully today is better and or tomorrow I should say and um let me know if you guys beat me because it's quite the beatable day if

right it's sa four hopefully you know it's a new day I need to get placement today so I need to lock in I need to absolutely lock in and I need to get top three today and hopefully don't have another heart seed but I don't know what this is why is this like lowkey feel like Bulgarian or something this this this feels Bulgarian or Italian ever oh is this po valley ever o I think po Valley's lowkey cooking like this or it could be like Rome I think it's definitely though it's definitely IL I think it's going to be this or like Rome dude I'm going to do is this token team's grass you have to trust it's just token team's grass all right Russia let bro cook it's it's an East West Road in Russia it feels it feels like it's going to be like near mosow Scout are like somewhere West somewhat North too I think something like this is fine like I don't know bro like I'm not that guy on Russia gen 3 like no it could be worse guys it could be worse when you get what is this Northern California do you go Northern Cal like Nor Cal or do you go like Oregon I think you go NorCal here bro I think you have to go NorCal like weed and black butt black boot weed is that the 5K I think it has to be North North California right well let's go this be color no it's just North Cal dude there's no way in that's San Jose bro there's no way dude that actually tilts the [ __ ] out of me bro okay this is just south Australia and I I threw the seed again today where did I where what's what did I mess up on again I forgot let me make sure I get Australia right here is it's just going to be like this road like it's so boring it's just the the boot dude oh it was the Rome that pissed me off dude and think it's not even that bad of a guess because like I'm not even sure everyone gets I mean everyone gets Illy there I thought there was a Rome tree in the back it's a real thing and my Brazil guess is [Music] okay my Rush get I don't get top 10 I don't get top 10 today I don't I just don't get top 10 here unfortunately people give a good guess there to be honest what what happened here what happened here okay yeah so I saw this pan and I saw over here these trees right here and those looked like room trees to me that's why I said that but it also looked super flat and like that's a cool lock I went five or five on the countries but I mean that's was pretty easy and D my California get no way I mean we're oh dud just see your National Forest I mean in no way I mean I guess it's just yosity but like bro like I'm doing too much I'm doing too much but you know we're going to do I I think this might be my worst performance yet but we'll see how everyone else does and don't expect a top three from me probably expect a 10 or 15 maybe 1020 range okay but let me know how you guys did and um I'll see you guys uh tomorrow maybe RC can ratio me we'll see lock in lock it okay you tell me very difficult stre yeah what is this Italy I feel like those are Rome trees but the wooden pole is weird is it just like us or something no I don't think so France Italy dude the Rome trees are so looks [ __ ] France I don't know I'm going here dude it was Rome trees yeah I said the exact same thing bro I was like bro those look like Rome trees ah ah the wooden pole threw me off okay and the and the road the pavement was weird it's okay man lock in oh boy okay um we have grass so it's almost like we me and surely you got to trust it it's almost like me and RC played together a lot I think I mean it could be like Northern minus could be Tok on teens even bajia maybe okay to te yeah see you got make sure you don't don't don't you know it'd be really it really embarrassing if you don't beat my score today buddy that's all I gotta say it' be a shame sure would be good thing you have Reon against Finland though I was saying Finland all right this is I mean this could be further east like here somewhere but kind of just want to stay over here somewhere okay could be worse thought I looked east of the eurs but it's fine okay I don't know what this is that's a ball or something yeah you find those in New York I don't know my first thought was like California I guess like here somewhere maybe could be Oregon okay okay we take that I got like a I got like a 25 or something okay I'll just put it out there okay 2500 wait what 20,500 oh okay I thought you were saying on the next round you got 2500 okay South Australia and if if you script again RC we're going have to have a talk okay buddy well let's see thinking maybe yeah kind of like this maybe could be other side but kind of want to lean here somewhere okay okay you didn't do it you didn't do it you didn't beat me you didn't you didn't do it no dude so close let's go 100 dang was that beatable if you 5K maybe like I could have committed on one or two rounds and I would have beaten you it was Italy obviously even on C dude how has no one gotten above 21k on the seed it feels like a seed that someone should have like 22 23k on like yeah we're uh I'm one to two now okay so one to two all right well you you want one one you want one one me right now yes I oh let's one one right now buddy if it's fall coverage go that road okay all right it's like 12 hours later now and everyone's had their time to guess the seed did okay for me like I'm kind of actually ended up being proud with the itly guess after I saw RC play um even though we both called Rome trees but listen happens refresh I said I was going to get 10 to 15 I hope I I'm hoping for a top 10 I didn't get placement today I know that but show us the Carfax what do we do what happened today I got fifth jhk bag dead right and Blinky dude what is this score I could have gotten first place if we got 600 more points dude I would have gotten first place if I didn't wrong okay we're everyone going round one let's show them the Carfax here let's get everyone up in here get everyone up in here let's see what we got a gorc all right snail you got South Africa yesterday so it's okay okay most people getting Italy a lot of France guesses a lot of France guesses you know it does make sense it did look like France turkey Netherlands it looked pretty flat that road looked pretty Dutch I could see that too okay who got Rome who my Rome Lads we got tricker Blinky and G getting Rome lots of us in po valley up here so that makes sense round two where we go Brazil token team's grass bro de knows the token team's grass so does totic and V and Ziggy and uh aan and nipped Y also get goyos but it's it's a real thing okay everyone get Brazil pretty standard Russia I'm not even going to talk about Russia everyone going west for the most part no one likes no one likes guessing Russia dude snail bro snail you're California you can't be missing California snail de is the only one getting that South but everyone going North Cal so have Los Angeles guys yeah I mean everyone like 90% people getting Los Angeles or California and most of an essay here de with the good where did how did Deb lose this he had good uh good guesses all around maybe the Brazil is it the Russia probably the Russia anyways all right let's update the sheet so Blinky got first uh no Blinky are TR already has points right yeah blink is have six de gang two de getting four and bag getting one so he's at five I know you guys are like oh rainbow why don't you do filter crate filter no guys that's too like nerd like what the [ __ ] this takes two seconds guys it's it's way more based all right and I'm now tied for a second with like eight people so Blinky taking the lead with six points and uh yeah well interesting day to say the least but I'll see you guys tomorrow see how we do then ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -12.225749873573687,

we're back it's day three and I'm about to pop off on the daily challenge and I'm GNA do so well that you guys will think wow how did he do that round one is turkey let's cook in Turkey it looks like it's going to be something Southern like maybe even a Batman guess would be good to be honest white gen for a car turkey yeah I think I mean it's flat as  I'm going to do something like this like lowkey Syria border okay it was Sy order that makes sense we'll take that round two this is not easy I miss just South Africa it looks like the exact same location we had the other day and it was like right here I feel like it's going to be more East like something over here southeast of Victoria my best bet pretty dry no big mountains in the distance I have to go closer to Victoria though I think but I think something like this makes sense a lot even maybe even their stini some of the es grass what if this is actually this is never stini something like this solid guess rainbolt solid guess lock in dude I thought for a second this was the kitos road it's not though is it is it ever the five is it ever uh the 30C I said 5c 30C don't know I think it's north I think Tero is a good guess but I thought I thought it was this road but you can see a bus there and the bus would not make sense for a Kito so I'm not going there but if it's there I'm literally like going to be so upset with myself you have no idea but this is like in the mountains it we ball we ball put some respect on my name this look at the score the score okay I cannot choke if I choke this if I choke this what is this what is this gen two what is okay I this is the most insane lock I've ever seen is this canaries is this ity what the hell is this Gen 2 Italy ever is this ever Italy I want to lowkey say this is like this could be like a canaries which would be insane but that makes no sense at all is it ever South Africa is it canaries 13 seconds is it Italy a more safe guess am I going to lose a lot of points here yeah I don't think it's I don't think it's why is it low look volcanic though I'm going canaries dude if this is canaries I'll go this island I choked I choked so hard I'm going to show you guys a lock that looks exactly like that in this national park right there and that's I I call South Africa guys let just go like Petoria border like dude or like boss border dude that's so frustrating dude I cannot believe it I had such a good score bro do I ever dude I never go South Africa there like I don't know if I said it because I thought of that one Park I am so interested in seeing who go south South Africa on this that's that would be a great guess whoever does that it was in my top five guesses but I never commit that because I'm a loser all right if any of you guys met South Africa congrats that's a very very tough South Africa uh but I guess I'll check back in when everyone plays and uh maybe we get RC to play for us but we'll see RC has no get himself into I cannot wait to see his reaction um and here we go let's see I have no  this is where all comes down comes crashing down what is this it's like Mexico there's no way anyone goes South Africa on this right no it's probably just Europe right it's like Portugal or something or Italy no more Portugal yeah I'm like Mexico or Portugal  um yeah I'm just going to stay in Portugal I don't know oh it was South Africa okay who the hell goes South Africa on that is what I want to know bag is feating like bag is actually like what the  hey snail that's my teammate snail that's my teammate like this gu makes more sense though you know what I called in the video was that lock we had that we lost on in northeast of litu in the National Park I was like this lowy looks like that Park but I could I didn't want to send it anyways bag is baned anyway so no bag you you have anything you want to say to yourselves bag like what the oh I just guessed where I first thought it was first yeah your first thought was South Africa if you look on the right that's C bro that's actually C oh yeah when I see this I also think downtown Durban like what okay Loki this way it's like South Africa vation looks it looks so South Africa no no like this tree does not look South African no I meant on the right like the I mean I so and they went Mex but with soil it makes so sense yeah the Pines made me think like Portugal or anyone anyone anyone in the canaries with me anyone dude I thought about Portugal like I went Portugal I went Northern Portugal like RC went weird I don't know you might get placement RC you beat me again today how's it feel feels good all right it's next morning and I have no idea what to expect this was one of the hardest locations I think I've seen in a while and so I cannot wait to see how other players went and I hope I got top 10 I don't know how many people get this right and if you get this right you're automatically on the top five so let's see wi of Truth 10 oh my God why are all these wet that was an insane location all right let's go through everyone fat snail okay damn so many people played okay oh Chum with 7,000 points surely there's more than that though right I thought there is twirl played all right maybe not all right let's go round by round everyone getting Southern turkey here um I should have went more West more Ser border like I called out but that's okay I'll put I'll put a little message on the screen here with like a a map that gelas put to to help region guess um this but yeah but yeah that felt like a pretty standard lock that felt like a pretty standard Southern Turkey um everyone probably got that yeah everyone going little Petoria action there a little East makes sense there with how flat and dry it was round three uh aito yeah this is the road one two three four five six seven eight 10 of us getting that right shout out to everyone getting that road shout out to sponge guessing um in the middle of not on the road with me that's based um yeah most people get Peru here yeah I was thinking the 30C as well um or this region right here but that's okay round four at that point I was doing wait what happened to oh this is what this is the this is it okay yeah one Canary's with me shout out to Eddie I think that's I that's Eddie de in Spain we got RC mackam Ziggy jhk and zigzag in Portugal we got someone in Fran we got here in France Mexico and uh with with demitra and Aussie golfer we got New Zealand tasmania's make I think Tasmania or like Australia makes way more sense in South Africa Blinky and NW Lenley and Vic tricker and Perth okay or not trior who was that uh totic I meant trior is in South Africa with B dude bag like what the bro check in PC and that is my teammate right there all right so bad gets three points that's four aiman gets two aon's on here yet aiming two no not aiming two and trior gets one uh okay so no one's want no I mean I'm still tie for first I'm still throwing bro I'm still throwing I should got South Africa bro come on that's actually no I shouldn't have I I would never at that but all right another day in the books and I'll see you guys again tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round":

right we're back we already made it to day two I'm already I've already exceeded All my expectations hopefully today I don't throw the seed and hopefully I can get top five again that would be and we're not starting off an easy rounds gen two NE makes me think we're gonna be like Belgium or like France or something I mean it can't be the US it's not going to be Canada here this fence is interesting the fence feels like Dutch there's a hill in the back that you would not see in the Netherlands which I think we're going to be in Belgium and France here do I think there anything else no I actually do think it's either Belgium or France 2020 copyright does not mean anything that means the last last time was update oh we have nine seconds I'm goingon to go Belgium France border because I don't think it can be anything else okay that's a fine guess I think I think it's one of the two France would have been a safer guess but that's that's not that easy of a location ground two it's going to be Brazil or Colo this I keep saying it but this hill in the back looks more Brazilian like this region of Brazil right here but looks a little more dry so I looky want to go like either like goas or token teens but this hill is like too hilly for that area I feel like like I feel like it's going be something closer to the like Minos something like this is what I'm thinking right now it's pretty dry think this is a good guess it's just Rio man if that was green I would have gone there Mexico where's this Colo this is Colo bro this is a is that skinny white Pole right there meaning we're g me a Colo so I'll just go somewhere like this nice if I did if I dude I'm out of focus but if that if that guess wasn't and Rio was better I could have done better North South Road and North Ghana I can get good points here it's going to be this road wow they about tamale and then driving left South Africa probably near eswatini White car driving left flat I think it's going be somewhere like over here somewhere South we got 211 I'm not that happy with that to be honest I'm I'm really not this road is getable but I guarantee you most people go in the same North South Road over here with me on the n12 not sure how many go to the in there to be honest Colo people will get I could see maybe someone go Mexico goes Mexico in that if they don't see the see the um maybe they don't see the sign everyone probably goes for Toria I don't think I get lose many points there I lose most my points here in Rio unfortunately maybe someone goes Colo this a pretty easy Brazil though but I guarantee if I look in like like this is what when I think of Rio I think of the green like this like Greenery um like this is a free Rio you know but unfortunately things change over time things do change over time but you know back toback days with 21k you can't be too too harsh on yourself um and I'll probably go go Rio next time but I'll come back in like 10 hours and uh I'll see how everyone else did hopefully get hopefully get some other opinions on uh how how they did but I think I can get top 10 but we'll see all right starting all right RC decided he wanted to flex let's see if he can beat my score let's might be a daily thing should I guess shame RC or will he make fun of me well this already a tough one to start um I'm not allowed to say anything though guys so because in any anything I say would give him a hint and that's not fair dude what is going on in this location I know felt like France or something um yeah I mean I I have no idea France maybe UK or something could be possible okay was France don't gu me you can't get me on that I was closer yeah in Belgium wow yeah Rao okay surely like Brazil or something here this is like a click TR Point sort of thing okay that's fine uh should be Ecuador I think I'm muting because this guy spent this guy spent the last 20 days practicing Colo only now he's about to go that'd be so funny no I thought Ecuador when I let in a bamboo which is kind of Holo though N I go eador is my first thought like here somewhere nope it was col D ah that's kind of there's a y col sign to be fair that you missed what N I think I think at least I could be coping um I want say this rad possibly the other mode actually I don't know I don't I don't know I kind of want to Le this one though okay no this dude look at your guest look at us over there we two PS in the Pod two PS in the Pod um you need a 5k to beat me I think or like a uh 5K it's easy okay buddy actually yeah you might need like a four four four or something okay bro if you beat me on that I'm like actually like wait did you beat me let's go bro no dude you actually script it what the [ __ ] is that I script it is what is that colia bro you didn't even get all the dude there's no you didn't get all the okay I stopped my sentence RC I stopped my sentence I got I was closer okay where are you see a CO side bro you not see the the skinny white white sign post bro the skinny the skinny white the skinny white pole on the sign bro the one you zoomed in on on the yellow you can see how skinny the white is on the yellow sign what is this guy what dude on the on the sign on the right of the road the direction sign you can see the dude that is so that is so invisible I can't even see that that's just maybe I don't know what to tell you bro that's a skill issue I literally could not even see that what the hell okay you're too busy looking at the copyright buddy I didn't know to tell you I was not looking at the copyright bring up for the yeah dude if I saw if I saw the house and I mean yeah we had bamboo as well I mean that's free that's literally free enough of RC if you guys want RC tomorrow he might have lost his privilege but look at our guesses on look at our guesses on Gana look at our guesses on we can have we can have a little bonding moment here right we we'll just bond together we'll just Bond over there all right bye RC all right it's next morning it's been like 11 or 12 hours so everyone had an equal opportunity to play and all I'm hoping for today is I got at least top 10 refreshing the page wasn't my best day RC kind of ratioed me went to bed not on good terms with that guy just kidding um okay I hopefully I got top 10 bro where are all these sweats I [ __ ] up the Rio so bad it's okay we'll go through everyone we'll go through everyone you know I'm still getting ahead of people like trer and Blinky I'm interesting to see where they go let's go round by round if we can round one everyone get France Belgium for the most part shout out to Blink Blinky over there validating me a little bit you know thank you Blinky Ziggy you know man 96 Bulls representing Axel I think that's Axel's profile picture yeah too going UK I mean RC mentioned UK everyone G France but and we had V one in the US which is valid round two where we at where we at this is the downfall of your boy bro this is the downfall why did I ever go why did I not go R there that's just so bad we had Mexico and col gu you know I think what Blinky saw Here let going be curious I feel like I when I remember seeing this I thought it could be I thought maybe that was a piranha but um yeah maybe maybe that's what they thought but also did look pretty South so but no one getting exactly in there so no one going downtown Rio but yeah fing once shame on you f me twice shame on me it won't happen again a lot of people go to Mexico this is where I probably beat some people because they went Mexico um we had yeah dentor trior gor Eddie over there in um but wow Harry are coming away with a dub here not too bad not too bad yeah I mean the single yellow I feel like this choa guess makes sense look at all of us in the same road over here yeah it could really only be one of these two roads but it's the only really road that looks that North that's going north south like that um yeah so lots of people on the same road right here look at all these people holy [ __ ] I went a little too north but yeah I mean half the freaking seeds on that road with us wonder where you guys went you guys also go that road or did you what I I rewatched my play placement of this I'm like bro why why did I ever go that East I think I try and do some cool things for the video sometimes and I just and I just like I should just at least cloria bro why did everything it would be here but that's okay RC dude this is the most scripted thing ever oh I all of a sudden need like four 4,500 points and he's the closest person by like 100 miles in this like freaking SE actually crazy okay all right I'm I'm going to update the list now because I was currently in first place here zigzag had two so he gets five and bag gets one so I'm still tied for first

"guys all right guys we're back there's three there's three things in life death taxes and rainow being inconsistent and rainbow not putting the right settings on why am I playing moving um if you guys don't know I have friends on Geer and they're all pros and I do this thing daily where I play Geer daily with them and I send the challenge link and we all see who can get the best score and we kind of just have I'm better than you off and I'm playing that right now with you guys I'll will probably play these every day with you going forward and then you guys can compare your scores to all the pro scores and see if you're trash or if you're like deserved to be playing in the World Cup in the year you know round one cynical 15 seconds on the clock I'm g go northish not that too North dude I just need to go near tuba dude what am I thinking I had the 5K bro had the 5K listen not the good start this is going to be France surely you have to get white long dash out your lines I mean usually when you see you think of Norway but this looks nothing like Norway Co ever Romania you have to go France here this hill right here looks French nice okay what is this bro I really am using my Noggin right now bro is this this is turkey Eastern Turkey surely like Southeast turkey like Central like downtown like dog dude that's a cute dog by the way yeah so yeah I thought I'd play these with you guys and see how I do see how you guys do but I'm going to go s like right here I think but um yeah and it's also just wa for me to talk to you guys again I don't know I'm [ __ ] bored I do nothing with my life I I live in Thailand now I literally do nothing okay I make one video okay let's see yeah I think this this is a fine guess it was more North how is that more North I gota look at that I guess it makes sense actually okay and are you okay are you okay Annie Annie are you okay we're gonna be in the US I think if you were location in the US where would you be with a tree with a yellow sticker on it this looks scarily Northern is it looks pretty Northern do I go it looks like it' be like New Hampshire but also looks like it could be like freaking Tennessee like Virginia but I lowkey want to go like I'm going to hedge like DC something like this if it's like New Hampshire I'm literally jumping I hat it here like I actually hate it here what is this it's Brazil ever I wonder I wonder if I ever go to Northeast Brazil here I went through like I went through like a like a Philippines in my head I went through like an Indo but my brain ends on Brazil this is a very hard map by the way like it's a pretty hard map do I compete with all the pros on a daily basis yeah I'm a goat like put some respect to my name am I going to do well in this game no probably not I want to do something like this like bajia like Coastal is dude like something like this not bad not bad rainbolt 21k none of my friends have played this yet and I kind of [ __ ] up Sagal and the US and turkey I got a good Brazil guess and I got a good FR France guess and I'm I'm I'm at the end of the day I'm happy with that and so I will cut to the video at the end of this video and see how they do all right it's the next day I think this is the best way to do it is just to like give everyone like nine hours to like play the seed and then go through everyone's scores um yeah I don't know I have no idea how I did compared to everyone else so I'm going to refresh the page and let's see oh Lord okay I got fifth I got fifth I'll take fifth Blinky Lenley V Eddie trabot maam zag 21 people play let look at let's guess chain RC shall we do top 15 I'll do everyone everyone deserves a look ring Northeast Brazil for the most part Sri Lanka's a good call out I think I think Sri Lanka is not a bad call out there and we've all been there snow we've all been there keep your head up keep your head up this was not an easy Brazil in my opinion like in hindsight it probably is but like that's not always that easy look at all of us no one wants to no one wants to commit great guess by Gorka where did Gorka M up though oh Brazil everyone getting France some bu Romania I called I this every Romania so thank you RC Mr Romanian get to Brak it to you but uh your your passport is being revoked what is uh everyone obviously for most for getting turkey here but no one getting only like four five people going North here or like Central North shout to Aussie golfer shout out to Vay but Blinky to No Surprise got first um and so I'll put an updated list of everyone's scores on the screen here if you guys want to follow along it's first person of 20 wins and I'll be doing this every day um and I'm going to try and win because I'm not no loser okay and if you guys want to do your own thing with your friends
