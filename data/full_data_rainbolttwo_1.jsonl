right back to say 80 everything you guys play today I'll play Mario Brothers cringe today we have nmpz ad dubs which you know what that means right you don't move you probably click this link you're probably like is my game broken why can't I not move around no it's time to challenge your brains guys also you know something different you know keep it so it doesn't get too uh too boring shall we round when we get austrate here um probably somewhere southernish um so we got the bollards there we got some hills we got some Austrian housing I mean it could always be Slovenia but this is never Slovenia um switching 4 does have Slovenia now but it should just be South Austria here um with these ballards like a black top red strip White gen four um go somewhere down here I think is a safe bet in the mountains a little more West but that's okay wait what was their country there did I get the country right why is my street negative 122. we have a Spain here Lake to our uh West so we got the same signs here uh did I get the country wrong was that not Austria I mean that should have been Austria why did it say why was my text not anyways I'm wasting too much time um it's pretty green I might go somewhere like over here uh we have a lake west of us so I mean is this even big enough to be on the map probably not you know it's pretty small um it looks very small to be honest but I like somewhere in this region I think actually no I like some more southish more yeah closer to the Madrid I think somewhere over here what should be like right here okay this is downtown Portugal it was it on dude oh come I think it's glitched your guests vain unfortunately it was Spain let's go back to zero okay there we go well I definitely could have found that next round where we got Denmark uh looks like a Danish house here um yeah I don't know looks like Denmark where would we go pretty flat like all Denmark um we have bollards over there here let's see what those Ballers say also if you on full screen you do get wider image if you want to cheat but it doesn't really help or if you just have a wide monitor I have a disadvantage because I feel like I'm using a portable monitor since I'm traveling it's something I can fit in like a backpack it's like 10 inches like not really but it's pretty small I used to be playing on like a Asus like 27 inch wide screen uh we have 20 seconds left I don't know guys I'm just gonna go somewhere like right here it was just Copenhagen you click Capital day you get a good score this looks like Alberta to me they're like uh like somewhere in Canada over there um why does this look like Alberta there's no baller it's just kind of frustrates me but it should just be operated right I need to learn my Canadian polls is there something that maybe helps me more it's definitely it's either Albert or Sask surely um it could be Sask very well it also could be Manitoba I don't know what Gen4 Manitoba really looks like I'm not gonna cat but it's definitely sasker Manitoba right or saskar uh Alberta I don't think it's the US it could be I don't see it being the US it looks it looks more Canadian to me like somewhere in this region um I might go in the Border here he's kind of like hedge both okay it was North Dakota that makes sense and then we have Brazil with a very interesting ground lots of Palms I probably got a better score there and probably not we're in Brazil do you guys go here there's a question lots of Palms you go north right like maybe even like over here somewhere like east of Berlin I think it's north at least a little more southernish it could be like talking teens but yeah I don't really know I don't really know to be honest we have the ladder pull by the way this is a Brazilian ladder Pole um yeah I'm just gonna go here oh man dude I hate my life dude I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it oh dude that's so frustrating all right dude why no why did I go that South I'm such a little baby bro all right yeah I mean standard okay how we doing how we doing how we doing how we doing how we do and how we do it let's have Joseph Spain Austria then we're going west no no one going Copenhagen uh dude I can add yeah I got mantle of Vibes I did get Manitoba vibes uh because perhaps in Nebraska let's look at the Lock again I guess um honestly it feels more like Manitoba than it does anything else wait dude can we see that wait was this was this in the frame can someone let me know if this was in the frame this thingy oh man I need to rewatch my video wait let's look click the lock again was this what was this the exact painting no dude if this was in frame this is like a USA thing I don't think this was in frame that was in frame I'll be very upset myself um I'm exporting the video and I see that this is in frame and I thoroughly want to uh be upset with myself right now like this is not only us but like not even 5.99 chance you're gonna be in the US oh dude I seem to be more observant sometimes you know anyways I'm not going more North there because I said east of the limb like really upsets me like a lot to be honest like a lot like that really makes me upset but that's okay so looking at someone decent score uh that's so frustrating I really like this game it's not really fun why would you play this game you know uh already did jhk play do we see jhk I'm assuming we did let's not played today oh we had a USA round and we didn't have a jhk if if I see that if I if I see this I go oh it I mean it also has but if I see that like I probably go with Dakota's or like Nebraska foreign look at it uh Spain's fine Austria is fine um and Denmark you click Copenhagen fine so decent day though I mean we got like a 21k right what was their score yeah pretty much I mean yeah it's fine I want to think of something else to do because the daily challenges how can we make these more fun you know what's what's the next step daily challenge we're at number 80. cheers really upset me they shouldn't but you think it's something to to make this more fun for myself because uh it's time you know to switch it up um Carson City freaking first place congrats for this guy to be an absolute herb let me just uh weirdo uh weirdo yeah anyways um let me know how you guys did on today's good luck on demaros and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1,

right back I say 78 every day playing series every Sunday I put a link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn the great mixer together and we don't read together against cringe um I'm playing in the dark because uh that's kind of bass low-key um it's also 1am or midnight and uh forgot to post a daily challenge video so we got some maybe dubs let's run it um what do I know about hbw today I don't think I mean ABW is a very hard map so do not get mad yourself if you've got things wrong today because this is supposed to be hard that's supposed to be challenging round one we gotta go into here it looks like we have some indoor pull tops right extremely base pull tops I'm assuming that's what those are let's make sure this isn't ever like Malay though or anything like that because it could be um yeah my first instinct was was Indo I think I sent window here I mean is it Malay it could be Malay it could be we don't really have any stickers on the poles I think I go in there it was my first instinct I an mpz instant Endo so let's just let's just send it over the best where and it would be though like though I have no idea we're out here it's a mantra yeah who cares this is the nine in Chile and get the triple yellow red lines down here somewhere I'm not gonna use a trap 5K all right what we got uh Russia dude big country's bad where do we want to go in Rush here this looks pretty distinct like you should know where this is well now I will if I see it again um this is Russia right I mean it's never you crying no never I why do I want to go somewhat like East here nah there's 10 seconds on the clock like they probably don't stop I don't know where to go here but I'm not gonna kill I'm like not like a cat I have no idea where this could be is it Ukraine dude what and we have turkey I do I don't even care anymore dude I don't like you yes sir I loved you guys for broacher's the best game ever man why would anyone ever dislike this game that's kind of crazy all right what we got it'll fit car park you park your feet there um Southwood Seoul Bay Lions Club I didn't read I'm not like I didn't read that because that would be so cringe if I tried looking for that I mean obviously we're in the UK with water to the South we're like a pond to the South so uh East Side horrible day for your boy I'm not gonna have that's a bad score horrible Endo guess I went Ukraine on Russia on Ukraine went wrong side of the UK that's a last place scorp I've ever seen one but you know ABW is a bait map so it's okay to have bad score CP actually popped off um going Sumatra there um okay so that's apparently you know now I know that's dinesk so that's okay I didn't currently or I didn't prior to know that this was there no I do um while there is a there is a Ukraine plate right there um I can see the colors right there you can see the Ukraine's flag on their plate right there um and we're getting nine obviously I could care less to 5K that um all right I mean yeah not a good that good of a score let me have the mate has only do I'm assuming everyone got denesque that's those things where once you see it you now know it and uh I now know it so um I'll take it uh had some Russian guesses there too so that's a good some validation there from from them um going caucus uh South Russia there um but yeah now I know of course yeah finding that everyone's obviously getting the nine and some good in no guessers so um I don't like this map at all but I want to support my boy Deborah so I usually just play it let's play another one and see how let's see let's do it and I'm not even doing in BC um let's just see how I do um I'm just on the seat just uh just some random seed like an electron time or something way more North sure if I was your boyfriend I never enough it's pretty cool but I want to go like somewhere over here dude there's mountains like that what I don't know that coverage East Greenland I did not know there's even coverage East Greenland all right let's just go to a good country wrong like this like what is this bro boss is Dustin why I think this was Canada dude I hate these random forests bro these locks should never it's like a 50 50 between like Canada Russia Finland uh this has never Finland I don't think but like this looks like I would I would I think I would go there's no car I think I would go Canada here guys I don't know what this is yeah you go to Canada with no antenna right Cherokee back what was that plate what is that plate why is it like that is that blue strip or not I can't tell if this is Crow or not they're like Sylvania I mean I thought Slovenia but that plate I can't tell if that's I mean I think I always send Slovenia here but I can't tell if that is a blue strip or not or is this dude is this ever Serbia with antenna like low-keys nah this is slow bro like easy Slovenia actually easy Slovenia dude I don't like thinking bro I actually don't like thinking this is why you like to play ADW I'm thinking way too hard right now now you go Brazil here right that's Brazilian dirt surely once it's gonna be why should be like Cola or something weird though you gotta go like somewhat North Brazil yeah I think so foreign that tree I guess in hindsight I don't like debray at all actually I think he's a a shitty map maker for this um how is it not wait what oh I mean I don't know I could listen to there like that was not good luck for your boy sorry I like to keep playing when I get something wrong showroom Ergo design uh I needed you guys for more I think I think that's my my learning for today I would never go there in a million years would I ever go there I would never go there ever in a million years would I go Bulgaria there man like that is not a fun location at all you go us or Canada here is a question you go you go you go us right you go like Minnesota or you go you you get like in Canada I got the country we take those this is impossible this is like Asia roulette I went South I went Brazil and South Africa guys that's kind of funny that's kind of funny I'm not gonna cat where do you go here though I don't like this game I don't like it this game isn't really that fun like is this how I want to be spending my at one one a.m maybe maybe not what is this like indo or Philly or is this ever like South America bro this is impossible like no one gets this like no one gets this I'm gonna is even a Discord right now okay no no okay guys can you guys help me know where this is oh [Music] no no I'm not playing here foreign [Music] I didn't even think about Thailand that's a good good call okay um foreign [Applause] [Music] yeah hey um um all right that was fun I don't know what this turned into but uh pretty much just me coping or about how hard ABW is also let's make it clear do you think countries missing the content is okay guys there's nothing wrong with that we just had six Pros just get the hemisphere and content that wrong okay like some things just aren't aren't like it's okay it's okay is that coping maybe a little but Life Goes On so um well let me know how you guys doing todays and uh good luck on tomorrow's I I don't even

right we're back it's 876 everyday plowing Series where every Sunday I put a link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn the game we play the race and we don't read the other piece during his cringe aw again let's run it run back to our boat I mean this is South Africa did we gotta go Victoria right it's probably not Victoria but we gotta go Victoria you already know the vibes um so South Africa you got the double white outer lines with this solid Dash Airline Gen 2 is only found in South Africa so if you see Gen 2 which is like this wide blur on the bottom in the top uh you cannot be in lasso to esotini um so yeah but you know you already know we go Pretoria together so it's not no big deal he's picking some big points let's go Victoria okay listen I don't make the rules kind of make the rules but he'll love Mongolia action here of the car rack low-key thought and NPC this was like over here which makes sense I think considering it's Mongolia so maybe I should take that into account and guess somewhere over here North where it looked like I thought it was in Russia because I don't know how to region get us Mongolia at all usually what I do is I click Capital I'll go for the best but um yeah I mean that's a good guess right sure I don't really know not bad probably got more points going Capital to be honest but uh I just click where I thought it looked like a little South Orange action you can look at the Sun and we see the sun's North coming so their hemisphere black car with this overall um like dead Shrubbery and things like that it's very large there's not a tree in sight so I kind of want to go pretty South here but not too sure not a hill in sight either or a mountain or anything feeling somewhere like over here-ish maybe uh like an East West Road something we're like over here my best bet honestly it could be really anywhere anywhere in Argentina a little more North a little more south but uh this is reason guessing orange with like stuff like this I'm not the best at so this is the best I got it was slightly more North but you know getting um the country right so we'll take that we'll get next we'll get next well Nigeria all right uh uh yeah we have a follow car there okay it's very tropical I'm not reading you by the way I'm not reading you I was just testing to see if you guys thought I was reading um I don't know I don't know man I'm not I haven't got one single region guess right today Harvey wants to go down here I know they had a new coverage down there I'm not sure what this car looks like there's palm trees everywhere it feels Coastal to me it's gonna be Max North though surprising go this South all right we'll do it we'll do it we're risky for the biscuit not bad not bad you know that was some you know we're getting there in the end pick up 4 700 points all right and we got Canada um so usually you get this like cargillish more commonly in Canada with this like blue thingy this white car visible so that's a good indicator I don't know anything about Canada here I mean it immediately feels like it's gonna be like Manitoba Sask it's one of the two definitely um I'm more likely to go I think Sask here I think I'm more likely to go SAS actually I'm almost 100 confident in this is Sask for a lot of reasons in my big big brain big brain um nice version guests there in Sask as well for not you know for blocking so where did I mess up today we always put Twitter together that was good got a good Nigeria I guess got a great SAS guess Mongolia not that bad of a guess to be honest and orange like kind of decent I guess um like no real bit like for a country for big countries I'm kind of happy with that score um but where did I mess up for everyone else to get oh they didn't go Pretoria so that's my score doesn't really count there uh great group you should get some orange there and everyone go in the right region of Nigeria but they didn't go they didn't go Pretoria so they're like actually fake like I made me lose what 700 points still we got yeah foreign you guys are all fake as like what the hell like not even like unironically you guys are weird for that reason getting Nigeria we'll take that and going North Mongolia there we'll take that honestly everyone kind of sharing some more guesses going Sask together jhk 5K did it but um yeah I mean it's pretty standard so who got first place that didn't go that went Victoria so Pretoria was how many points so there was 3900 points so we got Julius shout out to Julius playful Chuck what's up my boy Archer you guys are these are all weirdos Liam let's go Liam won today Liam also probably cheated but Liam also because this dude's ate like 12. this Rose is born 2007. he's out here he's out here winning daily challenge okay get your game up okay well he's probably actually shooting let's look at Liam's stats is he getting that score with 48 games never in a million years sorry Liam you're cheating I hate to break it to you boy that that's that's fake as all right let's see it Liam cheated um how many games are here have played this is the first legit player okay argar congrats um also you know out here seven second guessing so that's just demand my my own heart there um also maybe cheating maybe not but shout out to boy arter you know we'll take that um all right that was a fun day kind of some fakes I really got to learn who the real ones were today not gonna cap that was kind of sad to see um so a lot of people that I thought like I thought it was better than that um apparently not man apparently not let's see if we can learn something from this is me desperately trying to hit eight minutes by the way let's see if we can try and uh also if you're gonna if you're gonna name your name you'll think I'm cheating at least have good scores you know I've seen that guy his name is you will think I'm cheating and he had like shitty scores like every other day like I don't think you're cheating for trash um that's a very bold thing to say for someone that doesn't isn't at the game all right was that toxic probably I don't really care though um who we got who we got who we got you got anyone else let's look at it let's look at zoen 334. going Pretoria let's go my boy look at ours guess you know Lagos would not have that follow car and it would be a lot more tropical it doesn't really look like that um and then explain to Canada with like the car visible also I think on the Canada round I think someone told me where I heard read somewhere that like Sask lines have like a white line in the middle like that I don't know if that's real or not but it's real now so get your money up and good morning early guess so the only real blunder by boy here was in the US so um but now you know you won't do it again let me know you guys doing today good luck on tomorrows and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -28.93378255113651, "lng": 30.937195483932},

back say 74 update applying experience every Sunday at public inscription you guys play today I play tomorrow we only get the play with every snake together aiming that really get everything against cringe um I Heard today's is pretty difficult um I'm not sure why it's an improved world for someone playing this game so we're playing the tournament on Saturday um usually it's like a harder version of ADW so I'm not sure what to expect today but um I saw some really bad scores in the comment section of last game so hopefully uh we get good score this white car Russia which is East Russia I think uh so we have long antenna white cars which is found in like chilled Minsk over here and it's also found in this Road East that goes up here so I think we might be on this road here it looks like it it looks like it um you also get the white car some other places as well but more commonly on East over here um and then she'll dance this kind of pocket down here yeah I'm gonna go this Road North South Road yeah I'm gonna go it has to be somewhere around this road probably um maybe up here even but somewhere along this road even more south but we're picking 400 points so that's okay round two here uh we got tuck tuck I'm like laggy should be uh dude I thought Philippines but now I think Colo because is that not the color cross that's definitely the color cross but like this Philippines Gen 4 have dude I'm so bad and this feels more Philly to me I'm gonna get contact Rock here I guys trust that that's the color cross that is also probably yellow plate on that car so we'll go Colo what's this Colo and then why are those Philippines um we've got next looks like a Peru white car uh probably somewhat more southernish Ace of lima-ish so why did I go not North Peru North Columbia on that last one I just kind of clicked Center just because to click the country but uh way more dry up there I'm not sure why I went in the mountains there that's a really bad guess but it's okay should be Peru here I'm trying to think make sure it's not Bolivia should be Peru though no shot it's Bolivia with me West Bolivia so I get good points anyways but it should be Peru okay let's go somewhere South like over here near the lake wow that's an amazing guess we'll take that this is going to be that's Australia wait Brussels Australia's Hawaii tell me this doesn't look like Brisbane and NPC um all right probably just go uh I mean it just looks like Hawaii by the way um You probably have to just go outside like kind of literally right a big island I don't think this makes sense we'll go we'll go here uh yeah somewhere up here and it was somewhere up there picking 499 saw like Skyline in a different distance and like what other Island's gonna have oh this is Walter like what is this surely this could be that has to be here yellow plates it's just yeah I mean maybe I'm tripping but yeah okay 23k dude if I didn't mess up that uh dude I played that so well what did I mess up dude I didn't if I went North there bro I cannot believe I went in the Andes on this bro not that bad but like still kind of bad that's so North I used to click country but anyways yeah um this is a not a pretty standard day but it's a pretty certain day for I think a good way to train your mind like things you've really learned um because it had like a bunch of really random stuff that maybe you wouldn't know if you're just playing the game so um let's see how I did against my homies think first I'm proud of that day that's that's a good day um getting white car here I went a little too North by car that's okay everyone going uh right Island getting great guests there um going Colo probably should want more North I like actually east of the Indies that I liked I guess there as well but yeah I just kind of like sooner they all went Bolivia I I literally probably Bolivia but um I had a great Peru guest there so we'll take that as well and then um everyone getting this pretty standard with the plates and stuff and the yellow Dash lines I think are common there also English yellow plates adds up um sweet 23k we'll take it puts him pretty high up there um probably like second or third on Legit players so not bad for a day we'll take that um just really just asserting my dominance on this leaderboard foreign no one's played uh yeah I like this we'll do another AIW excuse me another AIW tomorrow probably um it's a good like uh it's like 80w but the aw is difficult you know which is good I think that's a good way to put it it really makes you use everything you've learned um like white card there uh yeah grapefruit guess what I guess what a what a spectacular guys let's look at one more and just kind of like let's see what we can learn here from someone oh wow scores are really low 200th is 12K let's look at antelope going uh white car yeah usually in Peru the climate likes right how do I explained in Peru this like grasses stuff in the road quality this like dark soil is probably way more likely to be uh Peru slash Bolivia really um this house in the distance this Lake artist right here is way it's like brick like this random building is like we're very Peruvian I don't know also Bolivian it would have been a good guess um doing American Samoa on American Samoa or on American someone used to have a car meta to where you um you'd have like a back of a truck on the on your car uh so you can be in a record store there and then going near White car chilled beans but um it was more Easter just because of the it looked not like slipping sauce the The Greenery on the side of the roads and this hill in the background it's gonna be way more East Russia here with white car so um and King shelter so great guess there overall pretty standard date not really um pretty fun day though I really enjoyed today's seed so let me know how you guys do on today's good luck on demaros and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

bags 872 or the appointments here's some of that pull in the description yes play today I play Marvel one day they play together aiming like really the reasons cringe today I saw the comments about how very difficult this series was or this challenge was today was the hardest challenge ever so I didn't record audio I wanted to try hard this and to see how I could get to just really just so this is I I literally just kind of tryharded and just was like I'm gonna see how good I can do with like without the excuses of thinking right or about of talking so you'll be watching my full-on best I might have been able to do hopefully um you'll see what happens but um this is a balanced world it's officially probably the hardest seat we've ever had on the daily challenge series um so let's start round one I could tell we're gonna be in Russia um and so immediately well I was thinking okay remember Russia I know everyone did bad on this I knew immediately of a like a hilly city in Russia that was like pretty West I couldn't remember which one exactly it was so I zoomed in West and it was I think it might have been this one some something one of these Western cities I remember had pretty big hills and I was like but with the scores I've seen today I don't think it would be there or the scores I had asked people about I was like they were like it's super low scores like there's no way if it's somewhere like this they're gonna it's gonna be here I'm kind of medding it but that's I can't avoid it okay and so I was like okay I'm gonna go more East here because I don't think it's gonna be West because it's probably more East because of points so I just went to Big City that I remember had Hills East and collected there and it was let me see if I can show you my I was like what the hell uh am I recording um but yeah so that happened uh so I was like wow that's a great start to this very hard location let's not choke this let's keep going let's just lock in keep going round two I noticed we had something my immediate thought here was gonna be better better lines Belgium or Netherlands because of the sign and this overall Road quality here and like this uh the trees on the side of the road here are grown with like the you know the canal in the center right very Belgian slash Dutch um and I couldn't really decide the two here I knew it was gonna be the two one of the two and so I just kind of constantly just kept looking around uh let me see a bike maybe it's just Dutch but like this road feels too wide to be Dutch almost so I was like kind of maybe go Belgium I don't know I was kind of in between the two um and then I think I eventually where do I eventually go here I'm painting I'm like okay I'm just gonna go Netherlands on the border and it was on the border of Belgium I'm like okay we'll take that we'll take that 4800 we have 10K going into round three on what most people got as a final score this is where this one really tripped me up um my first immediate thought was like okay we're gonna be in Europe I used to say tunnels like this with Europe immediately um and then what I was going through was are these yellow Road lines or these yellow reflectors I eventually realized that I think they're just reflectors so I wasn't basing my guess off of a country that had yellow Road lines and I was right here I'm going through just like where is it dry and what language is that I thought it could be some sort of like Latin language and like uh in Europe like Montenegro or something like that I'm looking to see if we have any Karma at all no antenna no color car at all or in a tunnel nothing visible I'm still sucking at your Vibes and we have 10 seconds left I wanted to go Jordan but I was like that language really didn't add up there so um I went Montenegro it was it was Argentina yeah I was like let me just cope real quick where how is that Argentina is that even Spanish this is Brenda is Brenda Spanish I was like okay well that makes more sense for Argentina's black car and how dry it is um in hindsight Monty didn't really make that good of a guess with how Rocky and how dry that mound was in the distance but I was like okay well this is a pretty obvious Uruguay we have the Trident Pole right here um with the white posts that's gonna be uh Uruguay so I click centering I think I get like a 4900 so 4800. this one really stumped me um immediately any good player will know this will be indo or Philippines with the white car I had no idea which one went to I knew it would be either sulawesi or South Philly those are the two in my head of like where should I go um and I'm just assuming this is only for everything right now um but I I'm not really grasping at anything everything's just kind of like all these trees looks exactly like something you've seen about Philly and two lessee or but really Indo um and so I'm like I'm in distraught let's look at distraught Trevor there is he's a straw and so I'm like Where'd I go here I'm looking on that sign right there I'm like is that maybe an endo sign white car you get this exact card with Philippines and Indo it's a very hot location I went South Philly and it was just to Endo so we'll see but pick up 2500 points and getting a 17K which in hindsight really isn't that bad I mean I did 4K best on my friends list and I ended up getting let's see what's what place did I get yeah all my friends all went we all had similar guesses outside that Russia and urkutsk but yeah only one that went Monty there we have one Jordan they're in Turkey um yeah that's that's honestly an unbeatable round I was like wait where did snail go I couldn't find snow but snow just went Las Vegas I think I think I found it here in a second and uh which I think makes sense makes more sense in Montenegro because there was no car meta so the US makes sense plus we had uh kind of dry Hills in the background where if you were in Monte you'd have to kind of like scattered trees or the tips but I didn't know I had no I didn't know any better um so thank you for not rage quoting to my friends though I I had a lot of Pros that end up doing just rage quoting the seed because they got bad scores which is not that's not fun you know you're supposed to be bad on this you know 17K was like what sword I did was 26. when reality that's probably 20th because most people probably cheated um but yeah 26 17K that is the hardest daily challenge series we've ever had so um yeah Lindley went so let's see there me and Juliet both went uh Philippine South Philly makes sense it's a good guess in my opinion South Philly is a fine guest There Lonely also getting your hoods and deliver East but yeah nothing too crazy um ninja loiter is doing what the hell is this come from bro can you explain yourself sir um because I I don't know maybe repeat maybe that's just I'm just bad uh but yeah 26 will take that um see what else we got uh let's see what was uh who else was on the list did I scroll down I think I scroll down so zigzag and trickster and jhk did top 50 15K is 50th um so jhk gang Argentina there which is the most impressive thing ever to be honest um not sure how you do that I mentioned Jordan I thought maybe Jordan um I think that's a better guess I think the language it was just confusing to me because I feel like in Jordan you probably wouldn't have that alphabet on the sign there getting an Easter Ocean City there um mainly getting the rights to do the recruits but yeah and everyone going Philly there as you can see lindley's the only person that went in though uh so we all got the same Philly Vibes here which is just expected I think to say at least and eventually top 100th was 12.7 K so if you got top 100 congrats that was not easy at all but well done um let's go back to ADW tomorrow um good little pick me upper but let me know how you guys see on the days good luck on demaros and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

68 I think I hope I know updated points your service when they pull in the description you guys play today I play Marvel really yeah they play together get some extra Twitter they're aiming that radio because we're against cringe I'm back I'm feeling a lot better like 95 I'd say so we'll take that um yesterday I did pretty well even though I was very sick so we'll see I haven't played to yoga sir like and like sat down and played in so long so I'm hoping I continue kind of like it's like riding a bike right you never forget anything we're playing aw again because of uh when I'm trash I want to play some things to make myself look better than I actually am cope Um this can be Mexico we have the octagonal polls here we have a short plates colorful plates very uh Mexico you can see where it looks like a like the octagonal pole you have the antenna stubby antenna which is Ecuador Mexico Colombia and Brazil this feels I know we said we always go seating backs together I actually think this is gonna be somewhat either Yucatan or um like somewhere South down here what compete or something somewhere over here I think it might just be Yucatan though it's a little too hilly for Yucatan what should be it should be somewhere over here though I think um I think if it's this region or up here you don't go see the max if anything anywhere from like right here to right here you go see the mix but we'll go like somewhere like right here and not a bad guess so we'll take that just kind of that Greenery kind of felt like that to me here looks like we're gonna be in Brazil obviously we have Brazilian dirt um it feels like we're gonna be somewhere immediately in this region it's pretty South near like Sao Paulo I wouldn't be surprised if we could see like piranha Pines or something here but we don't it feels pretty Southern to me I'm not sure why just immediate Thoughts with the greenery it could just be Max North on trash but it's pretty green uh Brazil also uses only long plates just to get indicator um yeah I'm gonna get pretty bad score on this one I think I'm not gonna cap um that's interesting back there I don't know not doing Angola let's go somewhere like this B I like some really over here I think I could look you see this thing up here actually no I don't it's gonna be somewhere down here that's my first instinct my first instinct's never wrong it was somewhere like right here all things all things considered not that bad looks like we just have a um numberlay here uh we have a black sticker which is means Mainland Malay um black monster poles are having left is Malay as well as like Sri Lanka things like that um it feels like an East Coast somewhere over here to me like this climate this like very dry tropical climate feels like somewhere over here to me um and it's kind of risky yes because you could lose a lot of points here but it's honestly the best thing I have and what I mean you're it's gonna be mainly somewhere here so you're not really I mean I'm getting a 4K ish 3900 4K regardless so uh it was just way more North okay and then we have a SK this doesn't really matter at all you click Center or you click Soul oh let's talk about

because anyone that reads is gonna get that 5K very easily everyone that knows how to scan it wasn't my Mexico guess oh they all went Yucatan I don't know I just felt like Southern it looked too hilly

friend uh let's look at this let's look at this is there anything here I should read besides Reykjavik blund us balloon Duos blonde Duos that's pretty big that's very big that would have helped a lot

back is day 67 everyday applying series Arizona death Link in the description you guys play today I've played Marvel on the other play guys racing next Saturday and we don't really like these Rings cringe um I currently have 102 degree fever or 39 degrees Celsius as I've learned um so um but you know it's worse than having 102 degree fever missing two daily challenges in a row so I'm not gonna let that happen am I gonna play good today or make a guesses that I'll do it no or I'm gonna have a um excuse me I'm gonna have a Jordan flu type game and get like 24K around dude I'm so sorry I told myself I have to record this round one we have Sri Lanka with the black and white stripe poles um the uh the Chevron usually you get Sri Lanka card but that's not visible here also you can see we're driving left um countries that have these I mean you have these in Malay as well but should be Sri Lanka here with the red light Chevron as well driving the left um it's ACW so commonly you get these type of locations where the car is invisible to make it more difficult usually when it gets up north it's like super dry so I'm gonna go somewhere southish down here okay pick up 4 700. we have a Japan um in the area codes or anything like that I don't think so um yeah I'm looking for guy wire or something right now that can help me Nothing's Gonna help me here though I don't think it feels more Southern to me I think um but I have nothing to back it up and I'm kind of just a little loser and just want to go Tokyo because that's where it's always going to be so I'm just gonna go Obama for the memes oh dude I can't remember where Obama was that's how bad you know I fell on off there it is it was a little more south but that's fine my vibes are right and we got 4 500 on going Obama so I'm bond is German it means these nuts so this is where in German if you had German it can't be in Germany with this Gen 4 coverage um blue card in four um so really the only places that this it could be is Austria with German because uh Luxembourg has yellow plates with a yellow front and back um and the Switzerland has low cam in Belgium has red blade so you're gonna be an Austria here with German um I want to go Vienna I mean this is some other big city I'm pretty mountainous Michael Cross I mean Vienna would have the street signs with like the you would have the signs on the side here so this is a sign all right I'm gonna go Lumbers maybe across could be at the end of though oh it was it was milk that looked like a much bigger city but we're picking up 4 600 so that's okay this should be this most Estonian green blur I've ever seen in my entire life I mean that looks like a lot of the inside but you guys have to know that the green blur is real and true you can if this is Lobby that's just no like I don't even care to look at signs or anything this is the most obvious Scrambler with this uh you can see like there's like a green tent where I feel like this there's not really green tent green tent usually in Latvia you get a thicker border and that looks kind of thickens to me but I don't think I do a lot of you here because of the green blur is so strong and it's never a fish true it's not ever a fake Meadow anyways have a Cambodia uh you get this car in Cambodia with um the yellow like the racing stripes on the back I guess I'm not sure you also get Triple antenna or triple stub and tan the triple wire um this looks pretty Eastern or Western to me this looks pretty far east or pretty far west to me um I think they go pretty West here though just because why not yeah sure I don't really care I'm gonna get a good score regardless you're like over here that was just North I got 23k with 100 with 102 degree fever tell me I'm not the goat um I didn't do I didn't do better than my friends kind of easy seed but pretty standard day as some would say let's look at my homies and see how we did um all right everyone going north there I guess we might I think we saw on this towards South which is probably maybe a good reason to go north there no there is better um what is bro doing it's gonna beat me as a green blur guys it's the most Real and True meta ever um going south in Japan there I wish I went more South I want a bomber for the meme so we'll take it um getting canva that's good good North call but those two um pretty standard day very very 24 cable day to be honest so um we'll take that I forgot top 100. at least a product too uh I'm gonna get top 100. uh well actually I probably did get top 100 but most of those people are probably cheating so I probably got like 50th um I'm gonna auditing everything I know my audience you think I can't be bothered to try and fix it um shout out to shout out some boy Oscar down here with me that's that's that's a real recognized reel right there man all right pre-standard day you Central hedge and get a pretty good score here to be honest um I'm gonna play one more game and see if it's a fluke or if I'm just coded this is like outside Rio why is there black in the back of that sign Pro Valley oh my god I mean what is this though I mean this is like that's a lot being pulled or some I've never seen that pull in my life with these Hills I mean you have to like Bulgaria or something here this is a very hard ground I'm not going to think about I don't care my first entrance book here is somewhere over here oh my god dude you've got me kidding me bro dude that's what Jordan felt like all right I'm going I'm in the house no I'm going acry here no I'm going to rhyme no let's do if I go acros accurate I'm actually running out of this building right now it's never accurate though I'm going accurate it's never accurate that's close enough that's close enough I'm actually

I like it I like it yeah it should be I think this is Island Man not Ireland surely is there any red strips or anything like that I can't tell um I think this should be right if it's not I'm I'm I'm bad this or Ireland surely though um I was just Ireland okay um I brought item in there I think what's I think what's what is this bro okay I think for a second sorry dude that's the thing about this I don't know these trackers like what is this Greece and that looks it looks pretty Greek like a Greek island with water to the north somewhere over here sure this might used to be more south they're like I think this is Greece like this house is this most Greek houses in my life so dude Bermuda Trekker mess with no Bermuda Trekker probably probably probably it's the beauty of playing this map it's supposed to be a country's wrong let's do you're supposed to right you're supposed to we got here what we got here yeah I did I did I mean I did pretty bad um why did I go Island Man there that's what that's what I'm thinking I think that's a bad game that was that was a silly goose guess um this like bermuda's like one of the Trekkers like one of those things where like I'll get it now that I've seen it I haven't seen Bermuda tracker before just because I main ADW and you don't get things like this in ADW that's why I want to play more maps you know so that's okay to get things wrong let me know how you guys did on today's good luck on tomorrow's and I'll see you tomorrow which is me recording this in like five seconds okay so I have to I have to just pre-schedule these because uh you will you guys will know very shortly but um good news very exciting news but maybe you can try and guess why it'd be fun to guess maybe but uh let me know how you guys doing today's good luck on tomorrows and we'll see you tomorrow with a new map I'm gonna do a different map trying to try new things goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 43.42289631015138, "lng": -8.203618664892504}, {"round": 2, "lat": 36.25742912700862, "lng": 29.96207224835799}, {"round": 3, "lat": 10.890615396591658, "lng": 122.96879047456744}, {"round": 4, "lat": 52.94753395225953, "lng": -7.792005789157894}, {"round": 5, "lat": 32.25466938186492, "lng": -64.84103144269909}], "images_path": "data/iamges_rainbolttwo_1/Z0LK9KYBMceGoN9K"}

back is 857 every day the following Series where every Sunday I put Link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn together we play together and we're not ready later because reading is cringe let's run it first game of the day honestly like I've played like for games of like you yesterday at all this week because it's yeah this one this week John you deserve to you know to have those those days of uh mentally free not looking at Maps mainly because I've been look like I'm kind of in like my geolocation Arc so I'm just like scanning for like different photos and music videos but round one we have in Mexico here but you know what that means if it's not Yucatan or it's not North Mexico it's cdmx which is exactly where this is right here so the mixer we have the entertainment right here this is only found in Mexico Colombia or Brazil um short plate on this truck and we have octagonal poles um I'm gonna expect everyone is going cdmx here and if you didn't you're a coward round two looks like we have South Argentina uh based off this like strawberry and overall vegetation and climate we're looking at the sun probably would see the sun's in the north which means we'd be in the southern hemisphere um as far as like like region guessing within Argentina here is gonna be kind of difficult I do think it's more south but this is basically I think uh this vegetation is like super like South Orange I think it could be like somewhere over here my best guess um I don't know honestly this is like an impossible reason to guess in my opinion like I'm so bad at or like down here how sad to go um so what should just be Max North that'd be quite the L but I think something like this is safe so we'll go like right about right there a little more North but uh we'll take it we'll take it we have a what looks like a Romania here we have the telephone pole is here with the white on the bottom um with a holy pole super common in Romania um if you look at the language I saw language somewhere where did I see it I saw it right here um I don't know how to tell you that's Romanian because I don't know any letters in there to look remaining to me but overall this is gonna be super row um pretty mountainous or not pretty mountainous but starting by Hills so um I mean when you start by Hills you know not two big Hills but usually most mountain regions here here I I wanted Loki go eastish it should be quite bad for your boy but I look you want to go like somewhere east of Bucharest here so that's my best bet not sure why I think it's along the east line here but if it's West I'm super sad I'm super sad we have a Denmark I don't care I still get Max points okay um yeah so we had the signs here with the thingies uh when they're like hanging like that or they're super colorful you see the signs like that it's gonna be Denmark if you have bollards uh usually there's like a you can see the yellow front um it's a it's it's it's a it's gonna be uh Denmark Belgium has similar ones but it doesn't have the stripper top and this AE right here this like thingy like that it's only found in uh Denmark Norway no it's only found in Denmark and uh yeah Denmark the oh this o right here is only found in Denmark Fair Islands in Norway so what do you know this looks like we're gonna be in Colombia immediately um so I I just climb it oh wait what is that why is that there with that I mean obviously we're not that I feel like that car is rare in Columbia I'm not sure why um so very common with this like overall like I I wish I could describe it it's just like this road condition plus um we have the black uh the antenna here this is Ecuador Colombia Brazil Mexico this is never Mexico or Brazil I guess maybe see being Ecuador um but it's just gonna be a color here it's gonna be west of the Andy Shirley I mean is it ever actually no it's just it's just cold over here there's no way this isn't anything but color it just looks exactly like color I'm not sure what this is one pole not sure um 10 seconds on the clock like the party don't stop we're gonna go like somewhere over here now for the best um not a bad guys it's one of those days where if you got all the countries right and collected in the middle of the country you won you know and that's that's the why I don't like ADW it's just kind of too easy at times um all right there's like the skill Gap in ADW is like like it's just very hard it's just it's just maybe that's just me coping but yeah um like dude these people are weird no I actually don't like my friends I'm actually upset I'd be your own sometimes it'd be your own native Hammerhead is cracked you guys remember him from my uh donating to streamers video Good Times um I don't think I'm gonna play ADW anymore I'm gonna say it um I think we moved to ACW and get a harder map um I'm tired of yeah I've played too much ADW it's it's it's so it's such a bad MAP I I'm on the adwa train uh like look how boring this this is bro you get Romania you easy easy easy easy easy easy I want to get countries wrong you know I'm like I'm gonna think about country like 8w is good to like you know like film tick tocks right because it's just easy but like daily challenges and like if you actually want to learn I think we should move to ACW or a different map if you guys have any suggestions let me know but uh yeah I'm kind of tired of aw um just because there's it's just too easy and there's like no real like skill let's go uh uh yeah I mean this is like a pretty standard um no one would see the mix here but there's uh an area code right here so yeah but yeah so Romania Denmark yeah pretty soon your day all around um if you guys didn't go see the mix it's unsubscribe honestly I'm being serious um for those that are still subscribed because they want cdmx let me know what map we should move to because I I don't think I can do ADW anymore okay I want some I want some I want some more challenge in my life not that that's like sounds maybe like kind of wrong like oh this is too easy like I'm too good no it's just that like it doesn't make you think which is not fun and um all the locations look the same in every country also distribution is horrible you get like half the half the time you get Taiwan at aw it's always Pretoria which is cool that's why we the reason why I say we occupatory is because ADW is so bad that the location of South Africa is always Victoria so usually just get big points regardless uh but if we played like an actual game like ACW or something like a community world or like something with like more diverse country more diversity in what countries look like one you get to see the world better and two it's harder and there's there's a more um um like Gap between skill which is fun which is fun to me um let me know what your thoughts that was kind of like my TED Talk I could make a 30 minute video why aw is bad but um if you guys have any map suggestions maybe switch it every day I don't know um but I don't think I can play aw anymore I banned it from tournaments for like eight weeks so if that says anything um so let me know what Maps you guys are interested in because I'm kind of over at the ADW it's just if I want to make a daily play along series I want to actually want to play The Daily play along you know so let me know um but yeah let me know how you guys get on today's good luck on tomorrow's and I will see you tomorrow good ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 16.89313, "lng": -96.76804}, {"round": 2, "lat":

back is a 56 every day to play along Series where every single day I put a link in the description you guys play today I played tomorrow we learned the other playlist and we do not read together he's reading this cringe first game of the day you guys already know how we do it if I see Australia did it oh we have a little Eiffel Tower if you guys didn't go Eiffel Tower here I am like unironically upset with you um black screen Eiffel Tower imagine cheating on a black screen bro we have reunion so this car with like the gone the sticker but on the back I'm hoping you think of Ghana here because the sticker on gun is right here the ray unit back back there um we're gonna be national park somewhere in reunion which is east of Madagascar I don't know man probably somewhere over here I mean you click in the middle and get like 4 000 points 4900 points uh but yeah this is a right Union car um you'll probably see like French plates and things like that in right Union because uh you know this France but yeah um I'm not considering trying to find the uh Park maybe do we have like any Coast or anything no I can't really see anything that lines up um so I'll just go Central here somewhere in this park or near these mountains probably could be down here but it was the other one that's fine only losing 50 points this is a gun to tape where it's on the front not back here that's a difference um so hopefully you went gone here and you didn't go very Union here that would be quite problematic I'm not gonna read that because that'd be kind of cringe um we have palm trees here I'm gonna go somewhat Coastal um maybe not too near accurate excuse me probably more uh accurate and probably more West I'm maybe a little more North a little more north of Cape Coast somewhere down here maybe um not too sure why or it's kind of it's not going to be North here what is always where I always get messed up is when it's over here in the end too I really should learn that area but I think over here is a really good guess I mean we have a road going pretty East or West though so price you guys in East West Road I mean is it ever this road down here you have water to the South do we I think so we'll go we'll go somewhere like uh what was somewhere like over here sure pretty risky but it was downtown Kumasi and that's where you click capital and hope for the best um I think this is a northern guy wire I hope it is if it's not that's gonna be really embarrassing um with like the I don't know just it looks like the northern one to me with the stripes I think there might be something different about them that maybe I don't know but I'm gonna go North here in Japan low cam um maybe just outside send out here and hope for the best it could be like anywhere down here I think or it could be Max South and get 2 000 points it was North okay should have went more North I was a little scaredy I was a little scaredy cat we have a little USA here uh looks like somewhere in the South or something like that with these trees not too sure I mean it looks like just downtown like Alabama Loki um for sale what was his sign uh where could this be look in the plates I can't tell what plate that is I'm gonna go somewhere Southeast so like like Georgia Alabama [Music] what play is that this right here too this like thingy uh is more USA than than Canada by the way if you see this I forgot what it's called Tim let me know um yeah I don't know where I probably should look also give porches you're probably gonna be in the US over Canada because horses don't exist in Canada I'm going like somewhere over here in like Alabama Georgia Tennessee region it was Kentucky I was like wow this score is horrible and I forgot that round one was Eiffel Tower I was like I was really sad um and all in all like not the best day um freaking guess gone wrong or you can guess the US wrong kind of I mean I don't really think anyone goes Kentucky there unless you know place or you're cheating Loki um I'm hoping my my Philip hears uh went Eiffel Tower um snow went Serbia and um let's see how we did okay we all went Eiffel Tower that's good not sure why Snell tried the alpha us there but it's kind of a we're a champ if you if yes I mean okay dude um getting the northern guy wire there crickets by snail there um yeah don't count me on this but I think I'll put Let me actually let's make this educational I'll put a link in the description to the Japan document where you can learn Japan guy wire if you want um but I think this is the north one so I think that's helpful um I'm not sure what makes it North but I think I remember it being North um yo me and Ziggy down here Phil Ziggy bro but hey look at us bro look at us look at us man just out here vibing um butcher Capital guessers kind of cringe means that you like to you know be a little risky with it you know and you know it paid off um I mean the difference between second place and sixth place was 200 points something like that so I'm the only one getting Southern Vibes here in the US um but no one's no one's going uh [Music] anywhere close we just like it's like it's like a a force field like around the Kentucky here bro like look at us um that's actually kind of funny um Kentucky yeah I mean I grew up in like Arkansas Alabama and so like this looks like a typical neighborhood you see there I guess Kentucky or like makes sense um it's like a very most middle class like uh dude that's doesn't this like so I also seen it like oh dude we can watch this progress of his of his mowing bro okay so right here did he start mowing yet okay he's mowing okay oh it's a kid the Chumley I'm just kidding show I'm just kidding show me um no this is this is this is cool it's uh he gets buckets and he cuts grass it's just the best Both Worlds uh Blue Plate I did not look like a blue plate I mean is that Kentucky plate not even sure to be honest what else do we see in this neighborhood let's just go to the ground for it I don't know I like exploring little neighborhoods with like we can find a story here let's see let's see the cul-de-sac you think this guy hopes with the other guy at this dude they definitely have beef these these guys definitely have beef also his goal is lower so he's probably like way worse or he like just likes doing like done competitions that's my hypothesis here or he's younger Maybe but I think this guy right here is probably better I think he kind of outfits this guy low-key for this kid oh my God we look at the competition in this neighborhood dude um they should all come together and just play together kind of weird okay okay well that's some good Kentucky lore we'll take that um um I wonder if anyone this is what's fun about black screens is you can really see the people that cheated but didn't realize that we could tell if they cheated because like these are people that don't really care that we know they cheated you know but um also these people up here like guessing rambling getting points consider yourself not eligible to play my daily challenges going forward please um you can just stop playing them now to be honest it would uh that'd be great um if you think of Eiffel Tower at least so who went Eiffel Tower how many points is Eiffel Tower Eiffel Tower was 172 points so let's see who got here 72 points and got closest see more oh my god dude let me see your CR I think Lisa cheats I'll see it there's no way back to back I mean it's not the harvested to be honest but she's cracked they're cracked that's a little Saucy lives uh lovesa that's a little Saucy wussy Hey listen I know I gave you a shout out last time but that's a little sussy listen don't get don't let go of your head I'm just saying that's not a legit guess

Ziggy in Acura or uh Coastal dude look at me and I can't look but just great guesses I think it's just a Japan guest in the US guess that really really obviously that's the only other two s's um yeah

right we're back at say 54 of the data hiring Series today I'll put a link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn together we play together we go see them each other pick up a tour together and we do not read together because reading is cringe today I'm gonna get approximate I'm gonna foreshadow my future today we're gonna get 23.589k and we're gonna get five out of five countries right round one gen four what is this Slovenian sign so uh you see this like sign where it has like that black border usually actually it's like white I don't know how to describe it but there's like this like a gray border that usually has like Gap in between it uh that's very slovenient it kind of looks like Italy but like not Italian on the sign there um I think we're gonna be nearly though with like how green like this is it doesn't really feel like Serbia or anything like West like at all or east I should say so like maybe somewhere over here is my best guess um but yeah this is a distinct uh Slovenian sign um what else is yeah I don't know that's all that's all I'm kind of going off of I'm not sure I could Slovenia without that I might go like czecher Souvlaki if I didn't see that sign there so um we're gonna go Western over the West downtown Croatia but 4.7 K you know still allowing us to get a pretty decent score here and um okay so this is a Cambodian um mile marker or uh road marker with Cambodian bollards here um is this is this that one road you can't see antenna but I feel like I've seen a similar road to this um going into Thailand over here somewhere that could be a bad guess that could be pretty bad guess I think um actually is it no it's good it's gonna be North for sure with like how green this is in mountains surely it's like somewhere North surely right they would never not be where I think it is that's never the case um maybe it's like I don't remember what Reddit was maybe it was like even this road down here maybe it's gonna be like Far East I'm gonna look like such a dummy I'm gonna go like somewhere over here um a little more North actually hope for the best oh South okay I got the West I got the West you know are we back or is this East High okay so we have um like Thai Sasha Cambodian I can't really don't know the difference um but this looks like a tide pole here so I think we're gonna be Eastern Thai that's my that's my guess immediately here um what I say my score's gonna be 23 589 kind of possible we're kind of kind of possible okay so we need to lock in here and like seriously play this out okay so we have the typo here with like the the dots you know like the going up the side here um yeah I have to each time like this this red soilish and like kind of overall like Vibes like are along the border somewhere like down here I know for the best that's what it looks like to me you know like yeah like that's good we're still on page 23 589 we have a Malaysia okay so this is Malaysian Bollard you see we have two double white center lines here this is super common in Malaysia and very rare in Indonesia so if you see double white center lines like this and you're in between Malaysia Indonesia honestly instance in Malaysia and hope for the best because you're probably right um they do have the lines similar in um Indonesia where they see double white but it's uh it's pretty rare so your chances are you're going to be uh in Malaysia there and the question now I'm thinking is is this Mainland or uh Borneo it feels more Mainland to me like by a lot um but I'm looking for stickers I don't see a sticker on the pole because you know black sticker on pole Eagles mainland a white secret equals Borneo is that a residue of a white sticker I hope not because I'm gonna go Mainland here if it's if it's Borno I'm super sad I was doing so well I was doing so well I just have to it right into cement sorry guys I'll go back and explain it when I get upset I need some validation and I need to get something right real quick um yeah so Western can you hear with a car and it's like a real vegetation dude that's so frustrating so frustrating okay we've had two Mainland getting East getting tired I was doing so well ah so I'm actually molding dude I'm actually molding people oh that's never Borneo that's not good that's never Borneo bro she's never Borneo and I think what happens is the problems with doing these live they're not live but committed is that most of these my friends play the seat and they don't do well and they don't complete the seed so I don't even get to compare myself because they just rage quit I would definitely Rage Quit there by the way I'm that guy Ike's Mainland Borneo like in any other Suite I'm I'm I'm going back and restarting my seed um I'm actually so upset like like I just I just I every time I get upset I just have to like into this in like five countries to like just uh like just kind of get like my juices flowing again you know because like I just I just really like I don't know it's something about it just like validates me when I can get you know let me just get like 500 real quick and then like it's like all okay you know because like so sad foreign ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 45.651042074336466, "lng": 15.178940880846357}, {"round": 2, "lat": 10.73593966180585, "lng": 103.7426462100163}, {"round": 3, "lat":

back to say 53 every day of power service when they uploading assertion you guys play today fmr we learn together go seed mixer we go Victoria and we do not read the other because reading is cringe um yesterday they're pretty decent I think um it was one of those days where he clicks here in the country in ADW and you get like 24K hopefully we see the similar thing today first game of the day as always looks like we're gonna have a Spain here um unless I'm forgetting oh no oh dude why did I just forget uh uh Spain uh I just suddenly forgot uh Spain Chevrons but I'm pretty sure they're blue and white uh with a long antenna here going to be spin um what else we got just looking around I probably thought they were Portuguese for a second but they shouldn't be so that's good um this Center here is common yeah it's pretty green I'm gonna go somewhat North like Madrid I think but not too north um yeah like Northwest dish of the majority I think somewhere over here and for this it was even more North makes sense next round here we have a list oh my God South Africa um slash potentially yeah South Africa I have to go Pretoria here don't I have to Pretoria white car driving left s 1240 not sure what that means um it's not gonna be anywhere near Victoria I don't think um but for the for the sake of consistency you have to give Victoria you know because the off chance it's not that's a bad look for your boy you know or the options is so okay weirdo earthy weird next round here we have a checking Slovakia probably just Slovakia here we have Gen 4 with blue car right here um uh Jennifer and tana this is common in Slovakia younke and tangent foreign so that's common also this um pull right here it looks check into your lock in slash check into me um I'm not sure what that language is I mean it looks like it could be Slovakian um you get these like uh concretes on the bottom of poles that are coming like Slovakia hungry things like that so that's another good indicator here so I think we click downtown Slovakia and hope for the best here um as it really shouldn't be anything else so this is Max East next round we have a this is a pretty interesting round this is gonna be South Serbia surely um so we have no antenna in the back of the car here um Europe architecture um plus these Rolling Hills when you feel like it's more south rather than North here so I'm gonna go like South maybe like over here in this region maybe even a little more North like over here maybe even over here in their Monty Loki nah I'm gonna go somewhere even more south down here um I don't think it's too north Serbia I don't think it's north north Mass but no antenna is very common in Serbia North mass in uh Europe um plus like the original Phil I feel like I've seen this in South Service something similar to this so we're gonna go on a road over here somewhere probably a smaller Road I'm hoping that the one that made that mistake uh no antenna is very common in Slovakia as well okay next round here I guarantee I'm the only person that made them city government of bagui bagui in Philippines obviously driving right with a everything here I mean do I got scanned but reading's cringe but after I'm coming off that score I probably should look for the city of bagoia uh it's okay it's okay to cringe after you miss oh I found it no shot dude I mean it's pretty big cringe makes up for the uh that makes up for the uh survey I guess two slovakias I'm gonna go back and look at that and cope real quick um let's see what I did wrong here yeah I never selected here just kindly self-service is a good guessing I think maybe this house isn't full Serbian um in hindsight uh maybe this poll I've not seen in Serbia something like that but um no intend that I'm a meta slave candidly so um what are you gonna do about it what's she gonna do about it again last place no one wants to read with me okay okay we had some me Brad and Eamon with Serbia okay we'll take that we'll take that um snail's playing um I'm moving stuff from my friends list by the way after this because he's been toxic to me for Past full days um cope uh poor guy down here in Manila for a guy I'm just kidding still um everyone Pretoria let's go a little more south I'm not sure why CP would get a worse score and not going Pretoria that's really cringe in my opinion um but that's okay um I'm glad I had some Serbia thinkers with me but we all went South of survey as well which I guess is that makes sense if no antenna no maintains also come in Slovakia but um my camera just like is dying on me are we back close enough right a little blurry but you guys can deal with it okay it's just for a couple minutes we got through the whole whole game let's go through some uh little guesser quick reel here uh just [Music] work 2197 not bad these mess up Slovakia let's look at a random score uh Heather and Jaylen maybe MJ Lane went survey with me I see someone to cope cope with right uh zigzag whatever zigzag go I bet he went Serbia too bro I bet he went Serbia is my camera fixed all right we're blurbable today sorry I also look at these people uh so getting both Slovakia is where does zigzag mess up uh oh the Taiwan in Philly you know honestly can see that with the Gen 4. uh Loki oh again these maybe yeah it's easy so it's another thing for sure um sweet pretty standard day uh not really actually this is actually one of the days where it's not standard day I don't think mainly because I got one wrong so it's not if it's wrong it's hard right I'm just kidding wait pause um yeah I think this is a Slovakian poll same pool that we saw in round three but uh meta wins always let me know how you guys doing today's did you go Serbia did you go anywhere where'd you mess up um let me know um let me know where you didn't mess up and I will validate you in the comments because that's what this is all a learning experience so let me know how you guys did on today's and good luck on

right back it's a 52 hour day playing luxuries for every Sunday I put Link in the description you guys play that I play Marvel another player we go see Mexico Victoria and we learn together and we do not read together together because reading is cringe let's do it first game of the day ADW I was playing on blink mode oh no oh no where's my blink script oh no you guys can see all my cheats now oh no don't pause okay it's Mexico okay you happy round two we have a Thailand we have a two-lane road which means we're gonna be in Bangkok we're on true meta just kidding it's not true at all driving left with uh these poles um with the black on the bottom um the anti-script is going to be Thailand um looks pretty flat I had always had this spot in my head that if you see a big road like this or at least a four-lane road it's gonna be a or a split Road it's gonna be it's going to be two-lane road it's going to be outside Bangkok because that's really the only place with the roads that big right wrong but we're probably gonna I'm probably I think Bangkok is a safe hedger I don't see any mountains does it feel too south or like too it's not Peninsula for sure uh we have some Palms so maybe it's somewhat near Bangkok um not sure is but um I think somewhere near Bangkok is fine so we'll go like somewhere westish maybe over here where there's not you can't let's see mountains North it was Max East so far today is not going for going to plan as we have a Bulgaria this strip right here this flag is found in czechia Slovakia Romania Hungary Romania I'll do that again this flag is found in Czechoslovakia Hungary Romania Bulgaria trickiest lucky hunger remaining Bulgaria um but this with winter coverage is going to be Bulgaria um I think a sooner hedge here will be just fine it was Max East next beautiful location yellow single strip um black car we have Korean here at the circles um yeah you go search you go since you're at home for the best I've gotten the exact wrong part of the country every single time this is repeat from like round two it was like summer Max East down here nice okay I'll go back and look at that sorry I like instant sitting way too fast um Belgium has red plates flat architecture um yeah um red plates is very common Belgium though um I did really bad today my vision guessing you know I didn't see the max you know pretty bad didn't knock East tie Accenture yeah about as bad as you're gonna get but we'll take it um all game Bulgaria I'm being East Belgium because there's a repeat thank you Chumley CP is a coward if you're watching the CPE I'm not really your friend anymore it's South Korea yep so good Mexico's good points here you know we like to call it today right if you like to call it today a pretty standard day and I mean it this time I mean it this is where it's all very small countries to where I'm gonna say it's unskill related but it's a pretty unskill related I think seed uh just because you click middle and probably get pretty good score you know um let's see we got here Let's see we got yeah I mean it's two it's two the points here are gonna be two it's I'm not gonna find my friends because it's like you get 21k it's everyone you know um yeah I'm not sure what there is to learn here um Korean textbook Gary winner coverage plus that antenna um Belgium red plates Mexico I went CD mix honestly I probably wouldn't see the mix without the memes um I'm gonna guess it is a little more dry but see the max like that if it's not like too like obvious North or Yucatan it's uh it's not a bad guess so we'll take it um I'm gonna do one thing though um I'm gonna call some people out because we've got a good score you're not going cdmax so everyone appears cheating so we'll go like down here okay what is that guess first of all nice guess but why would you not go see the mix kind of weird this person's gonna see me next dingo C Mix Moon definitely CD mix no party did you go see parties and go see the next dude it'd be your own sometimes all right I'm I'm done man I thought we had something special who got the best score while going CG Max this person I got 23k with going 3 400 points how'd that

back it's day 50 our day following series every Sunday I put a link in the description you guys play that play Mario under the clay there we go see the next episode together and we don't read together if he's doing his cringe um two things one shout out to day 50 we made it 50 days in a row kind of impressed um two I think it was CD Max yesterday I didn't even think to go see the mix I only go okay Pretoria and CD cdmx you only go it's not Cape Town or Yucatan or uh or like North like downtown Mexico or downtown California we got Brazil here so um I'm sorry that I went North Mexico not Mexico City I won't do that again I'm sorry um also today I'm going to use every single meta I could possibly use despite how much people hate hate meta I watched the most recent uh gee wizard video and the comments act like I'm some sort of like Devil for using meta so I'm gonna make sure I use every single method today to uh to win we have piranha Pines here so these are only found in like this region of uh Brazil so piranha and southish they have like this like tree that goes like that I don't know if you see this you're gonna be like near piranha or a little more south in Brazil to know you're in Brazil you have black on the back of the sun you have this like orangish tint on the roads like this from the dirt and um yeah long plates are very common in Brazil only so we'll go swim there is a little more south yeah it's found kind of in this region so that's fine next round here we have a Canada presumably Newfie um looks like if you have a Canadian flag here um so when you see again the flag you know you're not going to be in the US just kidding um we have a back plate here that's white this all lines up for Newfie surely I mean it could be like New Brunswick Nova Scotia area I think but I think it's more likely Newfie here just instinctually um that's just kind of a Vibe yes you get these like yellow guy wires common in the US and Canada um these bins right here are super common in um something in the comments tell me I think they're for like if it's cold out or something I don't know I think it's like to keep male or something someone can let me know but um these are super common in Newfie uh Nova Scotia New Brunswick area East Canada mainly Newfoundland though mainly here so we have water to our Northeast and a town so we'll go like somewhere down here it's down there we'll take that next round here we have a Slovenia Shirley right uh Croatia or something like that uh so Neil is going to be Europe This Could Be actually anything about this one for a second I think this is slow um could be survive now I think it's a Slovenia mountains um okay so I'll walk through my thought process here this is this architecture feels more subvenient to me with like these Hills too um we have antenna on the car this is kind of just the average in the US or average in Europe This doesn't really mean anything to me um yeah I think this is Slovenia well let's get this B this could be Slovenia it could be Loki Croatia I don't think it's Croatia though it could be um it's never Austria never hungry it could be Slovakia I think it's just swimming it though she's Slovenia um yeah yeah I'm gonna here I'm gonna go somewhere over here for the best okay what's Croatia um yeah that border there kind of looks the same that's fine um turkey so we have the Turkish bollards here um they look kind of like Australia bollards um but it has like the red strip um you get this stop signs the only country in the world has Jewish on the stop sign b-type guardrails uh very very very common um very common in like turkey as well you get uh this language very common in Turkey you get Turkish but what I mean by that is um you'll see you have like that let me see if I can see bigger text here the S this s with like the thingy under it it's super common in uh turkey and if you see this eye that has like a capital I that's also super common in Turkey these yellow and white reflectors are um uh our friend like turkey very very commonly but they're also found Southern African countries as well so keep that in mind I think we're gonna be more East this year and then we'll go to someone commits somewhat Central um and hope for the best here we have like 10 seconds on the clock like the Party Don't Stop yeah I like somewhere over here ish not too East but somewhere Over East ish I'm trash at Turkey I'm sorry Blood Trail uh we have the UK yellow back plate um yep so when you're driving left with the Outback plate you're going to be in the UK um uh did you do what else we got I mean it looks pretty standard probably like North London north of London these signs are super common like these fence posts I don't think it's ever Northern Ireland it could you also could yell back plates in Northern Ireland um but uh I think it's there it didn't really look there so we're gonna go somewhat ish I think um there's a really loud playing going it's very green this is the most Blue Sky I think I've ever seen in London so maybe we're like somewhere nice not nice but like I don't know uh I think it could be somewhere like over here for the best oh it was thinking today too why I said Northern Ireland was that uh this white this white house dude white housing uh [ __ ] done it did we do I kind of just trashed it kind of really bad um no one went Northern Ireland that makes you feel better turkey I'm horrible getting new fee 30 more points in CP on new fee well it runs that two okay I get more points of CPA on Canada so absolute ratio did you do I lost on Turkey though um who went uh so we had two yeah something integration 50 50. really there's really I don't think there's anything there to really tell the difference candidly like that's just Slovenia border so it's like this right here all looks the same to me so that's fine um even the the British line himself went outside London so that's fine uh White House is maybe fake mail but also coming in like Northern Ireland Ireland area let me see what I could then bear in Turkey in hindsight um nothing big mountains I mean you get big mountains like that everyone turkey um but yeah I what's really funny is I don't think I ever seen that East if I'm not playing a daily challenge video I usually just sit in like middle turkey and probably get a really good score because that's a good score is on ADW let's see how um this is like Jay's here bear someone played today the party was up to product HK zigzag amen we already looked at that let's see how we did uh assuming zigzag went the same East turkey uh when Crow getting closer there everyone no one going over to Ireland everyone getting goofy we all had the exact same guesses so very very uh very very fun um yeah very very very very standard everyone getting Prime and Pines uh zigzag's guess there is really good um but yeah you get the prime Pines in uh in Brazil they're in that region Brazil from like piranha down I'll show them again so you guys can remember um but they're basically like these like trees like this uh that just have these like branches that open up like that these are called piranha Pines um they're very common in that region and they're everywhere right here so good info um but yeah I think that's pretty learnable um yeah pretty standard date I think I say pre-standard day every day this is maybe a difficult round not really it's a really slow Pro that's fine um turkey I just need to be just a skill issue but we'll take it um let me know how you guys do on the days um good luck on the morrows and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -28.324755426674788, "lng": -51.200576818115636}, {"round": 2, "lat": 47.14422519156837, "lng": -55.20858826579405}, {"round":

right we're back it's day 27 of the daily Series where everything that I put a link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn together we play together and um we guess countries right together today I'm gonna make this very educational I'm gonna try and see if I can guess what you guys did wrong I don't know why I just thought of that but I feel like I could probably guess um where where this went wrong maybe I'm gonna try it runs when we got a Jordan here um we have a black car with the yellow outer lines um presuming maybe you got maybe you guys went in the Middle East or maybe you went South America here because it's like desert you maybe went Chile yellow outer lines equals Jordan Israel UAE uh black Black Car Plus yellow lines as you want to be Jordan usually and you have a split Highway like this this is gonna be the 15 but I don't think this is a 15 because it doesn't really look like the 15 to me um but we'll find something that lines up do we have like any pretty mountainous I don't think it's too far south uh we've got mountains here on the 35 I'll go somewhere here um Jordan's such a small country it'll be big points regardless so okay it was a 40 over there is it even mounted okay um being 4.9 K I just kind of found the road with mountains nearby um the 15 I don't really know if they have that very mountainous Road it's maybe more south but we'll take it round two we mean the Philippines um mountains to the northeast or to the east here um I feel like maybe people thought this car was driving left but no it's probably just parked here um this like concrete road is very very Philly um also you get these like um these gutters very common in Southeast Asia so if you see these gutters probably in Asia but a big top of Philly as well as the concrete roads is going to be these like tuck tucks or these like bikes are very common in the Philippines um I think of like mountains like that I think of like maybe North Manila or like somewhere over here in Manila is my best guess maybe we're going to be not mountains of the East to the well we'll go we'll go here I mean there's mountains all over Philippines maybe a seafood hedge is safe uh I'll go I'll go north this is where I think most of the mountains are but we'll take it wherever it is it's probably more south next to that volcano oh okay makes sense hopefully you went Philippines there if not you probably went like Indonesia or Malaysia which makes sense because you probably thought we were driving left round three here we have a Thailand with this type hole very red soil makes me immediately think we're going to be East in this region um type pull with the liposite goes down the middle concrete roads red soil makes you think like more of the engine like North Thai this reason but it could very not be anywhere near here so I'm gonna go look right here and hope for the best because the soil color makes sense here but it also makes sense a lot of other places so best I got and it was a little more Central but we'll take that 43 going into round four with the Japan I don't know my plates so what we do when we don't know your plates is we go with Japan there we go Tokyo here in Japan we have the low cam in the case we're going to be in Japan with these architecture with this architecture maybe more southish do I do it do I go Obama's Castle again is a question don't think so I'm gonna go just outside hope for the best here um yeah maybe you guys went to South Korea or something but yeah low cam plus this architecture is going to be Japan listening it was so sad we've been better going to Obama next term we have the UK we have the yellow back plate here with a double yellow outer lines here as well water to the north uh in the UK in it okay it's just a pond so what Northern to me so I'm just gonna find a pond in the neighborhood sure it doesn't line up at all but maybe more south we'll go we'll go Blackburn here it feels like it could be Scotland something like that actually no wait that's big water tower East what we're like here or that makes sense no idea where that would make sense at all maybe down here maybe more cam don't know we'll send it Northern Ireland makes a lot of sense so another Island does have you know part of the UK it does have yellow backlights as well um Northern Ireland didn't even cross my mind working at 21.2k mainly losing points on Japan and really only bad guys I think but Japan's is kind of impossible but we'll take that nothing a very very simple seed today very very simple seed see how we did if anyone in South Japan they'd definitely beat me we'll get top 100 here and see what we'll see what we got Papa pop up to the top wipe away uh me and Blinky were the same region there everyone's getting Northern Ireland um how'd the pivar get 22k with that score in Japan that's incredible I must have messed up somewhere else um everyone getting the right Island there in the Philippines that's where I messed up maybe I should recognize that volcano surely I went this one this mountain range over here but that does make sense and everyone going East High and jhk presumably 5K net with another couple other people very very standard day nothing here that really screams out um anything crazy is kind of your Japan and um Ireland guys probably but and I miss my Philippines but a lot because let me know how you guys did on today's and good luck on tomorrows bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 31.86935711404215, "lng": 35.73205799283613}, {"round": 2, "lat": 13.29185135332684,

back it's day 29 I think of our daily series there's something I put Link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn together we play together we make a ghost together we make bad guests together and we go Pretoria together shall we yesterday how did I do um I suck at Virginia turkey and Japan is pointless to try and guess in round one of today's game we have an out bur the baller the national park wait no she's black by black white bollard's art and Alberta um but usually you see this antenna you're usually a national park at least in the US um so I'm not sure what that means I'm lagging I need to refresh my browser um well let's see what we can find here probably not gonna be near Banff I think somewhat more North uh there's two mountains over there bro how far north could we be I don't remember probably not even in National Park but usually when I see that I think we're going to be in National Park at least in the U.S um I like somewhat fairly north of this tree line low-key George Creek Trail I'm not gonna find that I mean Creeks are small a little smoky here but this black white black white baller is distinct to Alberta so I'm going somewhere North here to be far off could be pretty far south I lose a lot of points it wasn't your Banff in the National Park round two we have it looks like a Greek Road um very commonly you get these like wooden poles in Greece um yeah and we have I think Greek alphabet here maybe not actually that looks more Greek um over the landscape here it looks pretty uh Greek as well you get one pulls common in Greece so um that's my best guess here I'm sorry you're guessing I'm gonna go somewhere North here um it's not gonna be like an island or anything like that so we're gonna go like right over here for the best it was an island next round we're gonna be in like South Argentina all right black car driving right with this shrubbery probably somewhere in this region um yeah Sunset Sun's in the north Museum southern hemisphere with um these Road lines and black Google car and like overall strawberry I don't think it's gonna be that far south though actually with this like how dry it is I'll be a little more North oh man my original question today is not the best where do you get these Hills like this Valley in Australia in Argentina I mean I know you're getting all up there now like Salto this is distinct though when I go somewhere down here or North actually I have no idea where this could be it's not even near Bear loc Barrel okay how do you say that um I'm a little more south actually okay not bad it's kind of just uh Redemption Arc Redemption Arc can I get my redemption in Turkey here I mean this looks pretty generic to me I'm not gonna lie the red white Chevrons indicates turkey with this like uh you'll skip like this grainy Road and like turkey Bulgaria countries like that Turkish uh snow pole here over the landscape red lines you get all types of red lines of turkey but um yeah I don't know where this is in Turkey dude I'm not gonna lie I think he's going Central and there's like so many different mountains in Turkey it's not even funny it's not gonna be North it's not gonna be Southwest I think so um let's see what we got maybe somewhere over here it's literally just Central up the country because I have no idea and there's not houses or anything for me to go off of so it was East rent free in my head we have a Chile here um with these White Road lines we have Pari on the stop sign party is Spanish for stop um and we have Spanish and we have Chilean poles right here with like the they look like Brazilian poles with like ladders but they're kind of just like um they don't really have the ladder steps and presumably gonna be someone north of Chile here I don't think we're between North I think we'll be like north of Santiago somewhere in this region I think so well I guess here and hope for the best not bad breaking 20K um I'm really frustrated with my guess on this round because I know it's gonna be a national park but it just didn't look like Banff to me um obviously if it didn't look Banff there's gonna be somewhere even more south which was um you know not it was this national park there near Calgary that's L that's probably my only bad guess I don't think I'd ever go uh their increase though and turkey I should have got a very bad day for your boy but Life Goes On Life Goes On um getting close to there in Chile um not many people going east there um everyone getting an island there I guess I'm just trash and I'm assuming everyone got the park yep pretty soon your date pretty standard just standard date let's see how booking to public did and Blinky and Lindley let's see how they did in the national park I'm so bad for not going there when I knew it was there to park going Mainland Greece with me shot The Paddock going Chile and everything guessing in Argentina very very fairly um tomorrow I'll do better but let me know how you guys did on today's and good luck on tomorrow's bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 50.75595, "lng": -114.54494}, {"round": 2, "lat": 35.04267273746038, "lng": 25.45014636593816}, {"round":

right back to say 49 your day following cheers and we do not read together because he's reading is cringe today is a 49 right one day for day 50. in fact I did 490s in a row okay that's pretty we take those and we're gonna be in Cal there Mexico dude I had the rhyme and I messed it up all I do is mess up when I don't go and eat my catch up so we got kilometers per hour uh single yellow Road lines are a common in Mexico um it feels pretty North Mexico um very dry uh sun to the South ish so we're gonna be the north uh uh that plate dude I really should learn my Mexico plates it feels pretty North like I don't think like like maybe near Monterey some like up here Chihuahua region we have mountain ranges to our East so maybe we can line maybe it's even like over here low-key kind of risky but like it could be like somewhere near Baja I'm looking for cacti because you usually get more cacti this West but um I might risky for the biscuit you know I'm not risky for the biscuit somewhere over here it's um yeah I'll go somewhere over here I think somewhere over here hope for the best it was even more Northwest in like mexicality but that's okay because uh we didn't uh we hedged safe um next round is a what we like to call a beautiful location um yep so we've got the Korean text if you see these like O's circles so it's very common create uh green plates um black car leaf I don't know I don't know this Leaf don't worry um I think you guys know what I do here I'm not gonna cap um next round okay we have some language we have LV that's always helpful um lobbying brick I got it right this time um so yeah I mean that LV is Lavia so um what else could a lot that'll be confused with uh maybe you thought the LV was um this is also a world map moment I don't think I've looked at a domain like in like four years okay LV could be like uh okay if you think LV I'm sorry um uh I'm doing some like Western over here so well for the best even more West next round here Atlanta's best prices um I've had this before I don't think it was Atlanta had this location before I don't maybe it wasn't but it was like outside Atlanta or something like that like like North or something uh where was it I'm sorry for I think it was just Atlanta though I mean in the front there we have no fronts okay why is there palm trees on that I think it was like somewhere North or something if I remember I don't remember dude I'm gonna go somewhere up here um hope for the best okay it was more North okay we'll take it next round is a Peru um those I'm gonna go North Korea here I think black car very commonly you get this like paint stuff on brick um political posters really kind of everywhere painted um yeah white brick here again white paint brick um very dry black car it feels like North Korea to me I could lose a lot of points here and kind of get ratioed but that's okay because that's what life's about um I like it I like it up here a lot to be honest I like it up here a lot hey windows down chill with the radio on this feels more Northern to me um let me explain everything why I think it's Northern for it to be exactly in the south um no I'm just kidding um so I guess I'm really right about East West Road let's take it like right about uh run this road right here shortly um [Music] let me take this I'm just guys I'm just too I'm just too good at this game I'm not gonna lie too good How We Do How We Do How We Do how does zigzag do where's a how are you feeling how are we feeling Deborah what's up debris Deborah in the house I'm assuming we're all gonna have very very similar guesses I'm assuming most of the points came from the Mexico guests and the prayer guess um jhk how we doing how are we feeling um yep okay dude okay dude um okay I did remember that was a review for me I do remember it being more North so I kind of cheated there but we'll take cheats um and I'm just I'm just an average Peru guesser just kind of cracked um but yeah [Music] I was like anywhere here but like I couldn't find mountains that lined up excuse me it probably is but I just got lucky I think um yeah pretty standard date just thinking yeah I had a pretty good day today I'm pretty proud that day um pretty much I really guess every in every uh uh region so nice we'll take that um let's see how let's look at uh uh two I wish I could filter like low score um how's everyone's day going we're gonna go we're gonna prefer down today we're going pretty far down bear with me bear with me I think that's like the like the 20th like I'm on like a 10 day streak of getting top like realistically top like five or ten in the daily challenge I think so um I think we're doing pretty well you know ADW is kind of like I'm like kind of one trick pony on ADW not gonna lie um if you guys might see later today they're in like 13 minutes from the time I'm recording this playing on the world map I'm much worse on the world map it's kind of funny because it's just Urban Europe and just like stupid rounds with like capitals and uh it's so annoying I hate the world map it's like scared horribly distribution is horrible I'm gonna make a whole video on just like canceling the world map I think #world map is over party all right let's go to let's go to a thousand one thousand who was one thousand one thousand one thousand one thousand dude it's crazy that a thousand score is like 18K uh okay 1 000 Mr girl Brad okay so went Mexico on it's so laggy because I have so much like data really good mix I guess wait do I have two people clicked I do I was like how's that one guy make two guesses Okay so um yeah going California Mexico it did look like California uh climate but uh Mexico uses a kilometers per hour and the single yellow road line is not going to be found in really California like that especially the kilometers per hour uh California would use miles per hour so it's a good hint did see Atlanta um Peru black car will never be found in Mexico it's gonna be Peru chill or Peru uh Argentina and Uruguay but it also has white car but that kind of vegetation felt more Northern to me um South Korea were getting Beef location and getting that LV so two big learnings for like kind of North America Airline America so um those are those are fun um let me know how you guys did on today's good luck on tomorrow's day 50. and I will see you tomorrow

right back to say 48 of the departures today uploading description you guys play that we've already learned the other play together and we do not read together he's reading this cringe um I'm feeling good about this I feel like I've been on this streak for like pretty good games like consistently like 23ks so today's gonna be one of those uh 18K games I'm feeling especially when we get these indoor rounds um so getting here an Indo White cards and four not really but um uh we got some Indonesian um driving left yeah just kind of looks like Indo I really don't know much about Indonesia I'm gonna be honest guys like actually very little if I was to like rank my worst country I would put Russia above Indonesia actually or like I'm better at Russia than Indonesia because usually when I do on endo I just I just go with Jabba you know um like I don't know it really pulls here as well um so what happens when you main 0.1 second blank right okay um I'm doing Java we do have this mountain the north makes me feel maybe like Clementine like that but um it was just Central Java so it pays off looks like we have a Poland or something here let's look around for a second um what language is that ah barnus don't know what language that is it could be Baltic tester and sign that might look polish because it doesn't have the zebras oh is that a lot being you that you think you're right there could be Baltic you and then you get the line over the top comment in Latvia um so in this one more Baltic this house right here this paneling in the front feels more robotic to me as well um this brick surprisingly does feel La Vie into me like this like white brick um I'm not really too sure that's my best guess right now is Latvia I don't really know this language but I know that you is maybe you find that in the baltics maybe specifically Latvia so we'll go like outside here I was actually just Lithuania but getting the baltics there so it's okay looks we have a candle here or like a North U.S um we're gonna go here we have feels like excuse me oh my gosh those if we have like it feels like like a Minnesota or something like that to me somewhere North up there um like Wisconsin Minnesota I don't know what this plate is Green Top I'm not really sure feels North to me though those North for sure um flag that is trying to see if there's anything readable on the I mean this is ca11 which I hope it doesn't mean Canada because I don't really think this is Canada famous last words 508 area code yeah I think this is going somewhere in the US surely right I mean it could be like sasker like Alberta or something uh Manitoba but I think Minnesota Wisconsin's a safe guess here okay we'll just missed it we'll take those I have another Endo good Lord oh no it's Bangladesh okay uh Jennifer uh looks like a Gen 4 in the road but we do have the Bangladesh language here I think goodness um where you get the line on top um and you get these like these like uh these fields with like uh water and everything very common in uh Bangladesh as well um black and white striped polls are in like Bangladesh Sri Lanka Malaysia um so that's helpful but at least in in Asia I should say excuse me um yeah I'm not sure guys I think you know where I'm going here we have a we have a pretty big road going north south so maybe it's in three here like right here before it turns we're in a we're on a bridge too so I'm not really too sure but Omar West but getting a kind of this journal region there so we'll take that uh yeah I mean yeah just a bridge okay Loki kind of find dude two US is an Indo and one round and I'm on Pace you're somewhat decent so this could be good this immediately felt like somewhere in this region to me um like Dallas Oklahoma Kansas maybe even Colorado Loki um I'm sure jhk had a field day here um maybe even Southern Arkansas or something like that I like I look you like Kansas or slash Missouri that's probably like the biggest hill ever in Kansas though so like maybe we're like we're not on Kansas anymore they're bothered right here bollards in the US are pretty fake um if I go two for two on States in this in this round I'll be very very happy with myself I don't think I will though this is pretty it could even be more North actually now I'm looking at like Nebraska uh it actually could be like Nebraska South Dakota I'm like thinking about it more so we're gonna go somewhere like over here okay we went two for two on States okay we'll take that okay we'll take that all around like pre-journal day you got the Baltic Vibes unfortunately didn't go Lithuania but Latvia Lithuania ball sticker light will take that close the middle Dash going Java um getting Nebraska and Minnesota so you know got pretty far in Nebraska there but still gonna stay and really in Minnesota as well but all in all like uh we'll take that we'll take that we'll take that I'm the only one getting Nebraska and the only one getting Minnesota so that's a dub in my mind even if I got you know third um but yeah maybe the ca oh you know what Canada I didn't even think about this being Canada for some reason just kind of looked like the US to me um I really wish I could explain why I really do but I really can't I'm sorry um I'm just batting with a lot of you everyone else went Lithuania um I'm sure there's a reason oh dude I'm so bad dude oh I'm so bad that's that's not a lobbying sign right here um you'll have the thicker red border in Latvia um so this is skinny The Skinny red line is not found a lot yet it's it's much thicker and a lot yeah this is Lithuanian that's just a that's just a blunder on your boy that's just a blunder hey but that happens it happens it happens everything in Java um that's good I like that we can go back and kind of like make her make her Corrections there to so I can like remember things to look for things like that in the future because uh when you're just playing it's easy to forget of course JK did well with two U.S to Us's um it went Fargo Wells Fargo what song is that Margot maybe that's that um but okay well absolutely dominating me in the US if you guys want to I think what this is this is the case of map map I'll call it map maker syndrome where I feel like map makers have such an advantage because they just check coverage all day I know Derby was just making the US for his map um and jhk obviously is Matt makes in the US as well so you probably get a journal fill a lot of regions very very quickly if you're map making because uh you're constantly looking at coverage which is very helpful in learning really um yeah dude I can't believe I missed that a lot being the Lithuanian sign there that's bad and great guys by jhk and Indonesia there um definitely getting uh wait how did he beat different I guess in Endo uh probably his because everybody's uh cracked at the US apparently but we'll take it um and I'm getting closest in Bangladesh so we'll take it um who else we got who else we got look at Blinky I got a top 50 at least I want to say this is like my fifth day in a row I got top 50 and top 50 in reality probably means like top five top ten maybe um because I would I would guarantee that you know majority of people in the top 50 there is cheating but probably not not all of them obviously not all of them okay like we got enough people here we got enough people ding Bangladesh getting endo uh pivot getting really close into there as well so I'm I'm happy with my us guessing they're they're getting closer in South Dakota but uh in the end I got pretty close I probably should have went more West in hindsight but I was just kind of scared and wanted to hedge South Dakota Iowa Kansas so kind of scuffed there in my part going Canada I think the ca maybe three people for a loop in this trash can so that makes sense um but in general just felt more like Minnesota us area than me um and pepper going with Estonia so that makes me feel better and we got zigzag and Latvia we both missed a sign that we both obviously I think know the sign we just when you're scaling over things like that it's easy to uh to miss for sure I just hear like a but doing for my computer so I was hoping to make sure I was still recording all right I think we can we can probably with three big countries I'm assuming the discrepancy and points is a lot higher this today so let's go like 252nd and I'm sure we'll have like at least an 18K that we can look at um 19.4 okay um going pretty East on the US there um to sorry I think I keep making recording yeah I mean I where did they go in the US this might be helpful it went New York so maybe in New York you would see more yellow plates in the back here um you probably have a yellow plate right here on the back of this car but in general the Northeast doesn't really it's so hard to end this to describe like intuition um I I I'm not gonna try I I suck at this getting a lot view yeah so I explained the stone he gets there Bangladesh and getting into so what do they mess up on is that one US guess we're really sending back that's crazy that's 250 second place and that's the only real bad guess they made kind of crazy um well congrats everyone that played today did well let me know how you guys are today I like it when you guys um like put out in the comments like what you did and why you did it I think it's good to like read through and learn just kind of like verbalize your thoughts um also I'm curious how many people watch these without playing I'm assuming a lot but like how many people just like watch these just to like watch and learn versus like actually play along I always wonder that um I'm not just saying that for comments I actually actually I'm curious um but yeah let me know how you guys down todays and good luck on tomorrows and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -7.60038466796233, "lng": 109.6580903383618}, {"round": 2, "lat":

right we're back it's day 47 I think I hope I know of the daily playing construction you guys play today I'll play tomorrow we learn together play together we always will see you next together we always get Victoria together and I actually clicked to start the link before I start recording as we're in Japan together um so we got low cam here we have uh some some post I really should spend like an hour of my day just learning Japan meta the New Japan meta I think it's looking fake man the low-key I'll make this fake meta let's be honest I'm just kidding um no it's it's something reliable but I don't see if there's anything here that that looks pretty generic I think what you do here is you go west of Tokyo and you hope for the you hope for the best um because this looks pretty generic um Japan's one of the hardest regions 2 version guessing so um I'm just kidding that's all skill no luck involved right in that guess at all next round here we have what looks like a little suit too driving left with a white car people always I think Wonder like how do you know what's other Road you're driving around because the back of the car you know if the antenna of the color is on the back that's the back of the car so you can see you're driving left because that's the back of the car driving left if you didn't have any other cars or anything that signs or anything like that [Music] but with these distinct Hills um with the yellow outer lines um these white inner lines usually people always ask like how do you tell they're doing like the sutu lessertini it's the hills these Hills are very very Lucy too so yep you probably can make another good guess here I I could get a good score here I think I'm gonna go somewhere at like uh uh I mean this Road's just going pretty like ish north south don't really know not too big in the mountains over there but something over here could be good okay you know we're doing pretty good so far let's keep it going we got Brazil can I keep my Brazil going so in the back of the sign here we have the black on the back of the sign that's a good indicator um we also have um Brazilian poles here with the ladder poles that have like the indents to go up um looks like you cannot climb it um pretty green pretty green is that a mountain to our North that confuses me I was not expecting to see that mountain there because I thought it's gonna be pretty North dude maybe I don't go that North now I have to go pretty North it's pretty green though so I might go like Pi token teens area could be I think it's somewhere in here though this region maybe even more West this is not good for your boy I think this is a pretty decent guest though I'm not too sure um it could be way more south to be honest like somewhere down here but it was even more North ah dude I always think dude Amber Japan gets okay don't worry it's also it's all skill it's all skill I do not know these plates personally um but this feels something more southernish to me um just kind of vibes-ish uh but low cam you know I mean Japan pretty distinct I'm not even gonna try and act like I'm doing here um I mean not that bad guess Bangladesh so you get when you have like the language like the line that goes straight across the top that's uh you're gonna be in Bangladesh um big cities I cannot read Bengali so I will be sending uh Descartes or not the car DACA um oh we have talents okay I [Music] I can't believe I'm doing this see I'm doing this but I don't even know like it's such a small town I'm not gonna be able to find it you know cringe where did I mess up today Brazil dude if I didn't if I didn't like choke that Brazil gas I would have done so well today um but yeah pretty standard ugly when you're there I should went more North yep yep hey look at your boy up here hey I bet these guys were had the fake meta installed fake meta hey don't worry bro I got my instincts on lock I got the instincts not really um okay jhking second place probably first place considering first place was actually cheating what else we got uh tripoda did you do pivot what's up PIV dog all right let's see let's see let's see Denver how did debris do uh getting good we can guess in Japan where he where did Deborah mess up that was Brazil do my Brazil I guess I should have went North dude uh I think my first plonk yeah it happens it's capital pretty standard date pretty standard date all right let's see how uh uh let's see how there's a snake in my Boop let's see let's see let's see now 297th two nine seven two nine seven two nine seven two nine seven see like it's still gonna be like a 19 20K all right hunsta son Eric 05 so he's what 17. dude isn't that crazy uh so what uh mg there I think I can try and maybe explain my Brazil North guess more just it looks super flat uh I hate explaining things because I'm so bad because it just looks like that region sometimes um like not very many Big Trees like in the distance uh very very flat um I'm not gonna act like I know how to how the region guess um Brazil because sometimes I feel like it's just instinctual game Bangladesh yeah pretty soon okay okay let me know how you guys did on today's good luck on tomorrow's I'm sorry for reading in Bangladesh it didn't I didn't end up mattering because I went DACA anyways and got a pretty good score so forgive me um and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ",

heard back today 46 everyday playing cheers you guys play the iPad tomorrow we learn together we play together we always mix inventory the other and we do not read the other piece reading this cringe today I'm playing on um an actual map so do not fret also if you guys are trying to play yesterday's game it was like black screen it's because like street view is down so I'm sorry if that affected you I'm round one here we do have turkey we have some Turkish language um white Gen 4 car with antenna is Turkey um as well so if you're in like a more oral area and you have white Gen 4 but you see the white card right here with the Gen 4 antenna that's turkey usually I think there might be another one for you I forgore um a good interview for turkey is usually looking at uh water tanks things like that um error code means nothing to me I might go Western turkey here Loki though don't really know it feels kind of more West to me not really too East uh I have really nothing educated off of here to my opinion just kind of a lack of water tanks and things like that so I'm gonna go like somewhere over here and hope for the best yeah [Music] that's funny that's that's just that's funny all right we have a UAE here a white car in the Middle East is UAE um super flat I do not think we're gonna be East because you don't really see any mountains like that so probably it's gonna be downtown Dubai somewhere along better very very very you know you click here and you get uh pretty good points regardless so yep next round here we have Japan this looks immediately like we're gonna be in Hokkaido um like Japan we have a low cam which is like you see the white one on the bottom this is a Hokkaido cabbage I think where you get this cabbage in North Japan you can find it um on uh up here in Russia in this island in Russia um but it's also very North or in Hokkaido and it goes down here some as well but mainly found in Hokkaido but generally The Vibes here just feel like a kind of to me we do have the Cabbage here as well I think so it should just be Hokkaido here um yep pretty distinct and usually Kyle will get in here for Hokkaido as well as they have like the the arrows that go down to the bottom but we do not have those so we'll find just a East to West Road and hope for the best here a little more south in Hokkaido next round here we have a Peru black car black and white striped poles um all very very common in Peru with the Spanish here it feels pretty North to me not good too north um I think always a safe hedge is just kind of like North or Lima here without green this is um yeah nothing's gonna be too North here but I think somewhere near the statue range it's gonna be good hope for the best it was a little more south but that's okay and we have Nigeria red car Nigeria I do not know at all but I low-key wanting to go like the density or um can you go here I think it's one of the two I think it's one of the two uh you get gray corn like Lagos I really should spend like 20 minutes to learn Nigeria but this is a follow car and uh we have the blur with like these big huge houses very very common in Nigeria um so yeah do I want to go Benin City it could it wants to be neither I'm gonna open and sit here uh hope for the best it was been in city so can you guys there pick up 22k bad guess uh if you Capital guess on Ankara like so this was such a good seed I'm assuming you saw some point for a case today um perugas isn't that good but we're gonna do what are you gonna do about it 23k go take it um of course triplets are really well um nice why do we only have three people on the list dude everyone always asks like why do you not have expiration friends list is broken I have all the all the people usually trying to look at friends list but it's it doesn't work um so it's your Buddha getting close is there in Peru um yeah it was that red soil is why I went but in city or a new that's why um it was in between those two but it was just been in city um so we're all there wait maybe we were just like zoomed in each other oh uh Eamon and Dimitri made the same guess that's funny um no one went Capital but it did feel West it did feel West to us so that's good everyone going downtown UAE and everyone kind of of course let's see how uh the homies did today John Harvey Kellogg what's up what's up what's up Blinky of course always at the top I want to say blanket we'll take a top 50 though we'll take that mgln let's see how mgln did um let's do one more let's do one more anyone here uh now goodbye uh everyone getting Hokkaido Blinky oh dude dude there's no way that road is that small there's no way that he kind of was a white rose what maybe I'm tripping that felt like a pretty big road uh I like how mgln went North here you do get the Cabbage North as well but uh I'm a coward and Cara I might be spreading fake news a part of me thought I'm not gonna say it I don't want to spare fake news okay what's next what's next what's next well we got what we got Peru we're all going the same region Peru it does not look like this house to me honestly too green but I guess you'll take it and um going within City dude jhk almost had a really good game what was this oh Anna and I'm so sorry you're not verified I almost missed you uh Amazon City yep um also went and Cara I think I was gonna say I think the area code there is uh Ankara the UAE getting kaido and like again you can get some pretty they're going uh East that's pretty cool I like that guys um and let's let's do some learning today I think we provide you some learning um let's look at uh it's like a 197th 197 197 how we do it how we doing how we doing actually it's gonna be like a 22k so it's not gonna be that good at all no learning here at all Peru Nigeria turkey okay no learning here cabbage in Japan uh red soil red car okay guys some fruit nice nothing nothing I mean I wish I could filter last score by first score that'd be kind of fun I could really learn a lot from that probably but um let me know what you guys did on today's good luck on demaros and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

right we're back it's a 45 ready flunkers everything they uploading description if you guys Monday I play tomorrow we learn together we play together we go see the mix together we go tour together and we do not read together because we're against cringe I'm trying something new today okay I'm gonna extremely this is not good okay well I'm gonna show you what I'm gonna do today is I'm gonna play on a blank map okay so I'm gonna you see this map right here I'm gonna play on the blank map so I'm using Unity script um I'm gonna be using this okay I'm gonna be guessing on the blank map okay I've been practicing this for tick tock and I thought it'd be fun to try for daily challenge just to maybe give it give it a very raw experience of behind the scenes of sometimes these tick tocks don't go to plan so I'll play as if I haven't learned where Japan isn't like that though I'll be honest so I know we have Australia South Africa is like right here Australia's like right here you have to bear with me Japan should be a little more North like right here somewhere I think this could be very bad I'm not going for a good score I'm gonna low cam Japan by the way oh I didn't mean to zoom in I don't know where to zoomed in we'll go here okay that's not bad that's not bad okay we got the right region okay we have a turkey here okay this is not good for your boy either um okay so I word turkey should we be probably like not European turkey because we have these uh water tanks on top usually in Western turkey you don't really get those those are pretty Central I'm not sure why I'm acting like I can region guess here because I can't because I don't know where even turkey is so we have Europe This is like Sweden if we're moving south and then we're gonna go like East a bit I think like right here I think that's my best guess my best guess is like right here okay we went Kazakhstan okay that's okay though that's okay we have New Zealand this is not good I I can use it on small so that's okay we might be able to get a good guess here um so we have the bollards here the red on both ends plus um the you got the Santana uh driving left um Australia's right here yeah like Australia's like right here I think South Africa Australia it's like New Zealand should be like right here right here's the East it's East of Australia so it's gonna be like over here somewhere I think listen I got a lot more practices before I ever make a good tick to talk about this but I'm gonna say it's like somewhere over here a little more East okay right there okay um nope we're getting close though hey we're not doing we're not we're getting the general region okay uh black white Chevrons we're gonna be back in EU guessing here we got the bollards here um so let's see should be Italy right uh North Italy these bollards I presume I don't really know this is kind of just like a this is me [ __ ] posting is candidly um I was like I don't really want to sit here and try hard a game today so I'll just sit here and try and do this okay um I don't you guys maybe hopefully beat me today okay so I'm using these as like guide marks too these are helpful so like this so you use like right here uh let's go like right here I think maybe this could be a good guess not bad okay I was going for North Italy I I got Austria All Things Considered you know that's not bad okay round five or five in Finland okay I can do Finland I think I can do Finland we have the white outer lines with birch trees architecture uh you get these solid white airlines more common Finland we have finished Ballard here at least we're North Finland so we're gonna go back to Europe here it's like right here this is like Sweden and this would be like Finland like right here I'll go a little more North so we'll go like right here I think that's good I think that's good um let's see what happens see what happens um yeah Tree Line feels North to me it could be looks like Helsinki I don't even know if I am North right now but I was too North okay well we went in uh you know a c but it was North Finland and you know what getting three 400 points hey let's go we got 12K because considering I've never practiced where turkey is on a blank excuse me on a blank map nor Japan nor New Zealand this is not this is not a bad attempt okay um not a bad attempt let's see what my friends did all right we're not looking at my guesses uh yeah so CP is getting that uh Japan yeah very standard it was East turkey North Italy we called everyone called North Finland um yeah we'll take it we'll take it I'll take I'll take it I'll take it uh how did the product do do do do do it's pilot getting the right region in New Zealand right reach you guys in Japan going downtown Syria getting North Italy very good day for uh toponic just not getting North Finland there um well that was fun I'm gonna try another game I'm gonna try another game I'm just gonna play another game okay I'm gonna speak right there I'm gonna figure out I'm speaking right now I'm speaking I want to see if I can oh no I don't know where Mexico is so this is like Argentina's like right here so this is like Colo it's really great here okay not bad not bad okay okay Philippines okay Philippines so Europe okay no no South Africa Australia so this is like Endo a tie or this is like Indo Malay so for me like over I have not practiced Philippines at all either I'm I literally just started doing this like this morning okay so we're gonna be like over over here somewhere I think [ __ ] okay that's okay a little too North I I'm playing with a small map because it's easier to this for Rima in Brazil I'll give arima here personally okay it's gonna be like Cambodia or something okay so Argentina Brazil or Rima he's like right here okay I called this gonna be Cambodia or something okay um okay we can do it we can do we can do this we can do this we can do this okay this is just this is just kimbera okay so EU South Africa Australia like right here oh okay okay Argentina I feel like I'm pretty good Argentina I feel like I'm pretty good Argentina so Europe South Africa Argentina no Australia New Zealand chili Argentina this Mexico's like over here somewhere so Argentina is like selfish like right here I think it's like right here not bad not bad okay what we got we got we got a beautiful location beautiful location okay this is very small if I get this I should feed okay so we have Australia okay we know we're in the where do you start from Europe I wonder if it lined it up with Austria or Australia I think because it's like maybe East of Australia so I'll go like so we knew Japan is like right here somewhere so we might be like right here all right this is Australia New Zealand was even closer here so this is going to be like somewhere over here okay Uruguay so we we have also I feel like I have Argentine down so you guys can be like right here right Europe South Africa Australia Thailand Indo n a Mexico is like right here Colombia is like right here Peru Chile Argentina Uruguay is like right here okay not bad not bad no way in the last in this off no worries off okay um so EU so like

two where we got I heard Blinky did very good on today's challenge so I'm very interested to see how he does looks like we have a little can of action here with the single yellow red line This Could Be bait the us and it is I've seen these single yellow red lines somewhere in the US in the east coast like near in this region um so I don't know if I want to get a us or Canada here to be honest I locally feel like this is way more U.S even if it's a single yellow road line I'm not gonna cap like that could be pretty bad but like this just feels like like I watched like an NFL game and just like throw a football on this front lawn you know uh no I've seen these somewhere over here I don't know these plates either but they don't feel like like this doesn't feel like a can of the plate does it I'm tripping I'm tripping I'm tripping tripping I'm going like somewhere over here I could easily be anywhere in this realm as well but it was over there okay I have seen single yellow red lines over there that makes sense round three we have a North Macedonia um with Cyrillic no antenna I think with his overall climate and vegetation I mean this is another one of those Vibe things these like this uh kind of dryness in the grass here it feels very North Mass we have Cyrillic and no antenna doesn't really feel like Serbia um yeah this is another vibe guess um so I'm gonna go somewhere I think right about Hill I used to usually get like flies on the camera this road right here in the west you have a green truck following you so I'm gonna go somewhere over here on the E 75 I guarantee this dude Blinky 5K this I guarantee it but I think it's a safe guess and it was a little more Southeast um we have a Ghana here this will be fun let's see what we do here um black tape on cart is gonna um if it's on the top right back here if it's back here it's reunion but uh front right is gonna feels not too Coastal maybe someone Coastal not too Coastal actually I'm feeling pretty coastal mountains to a South though kind of interesting um I kind of like this region right here to be honest not too sure my best guess I don't think it's too north I really don't think it's too north I don't think it's too East either um north of Fillmore dry I think everyone have as many Palms like we do we have one here so I think something we might have some popular hairs too not too sure I don't think it's too Coastal though so I'm gonna go somewhere like south of kamasa here hope for the best it was pretty East on that road on the N2 I always get that road confused that's okay and then we have just an Australia here uh what right angle is it going it's going directly like north south so the two options I think we have here are one like this road right here on the one somewhere like over here under 95 or or like down here in Alice Springs or that's a gap on the road line and this is north south Australia this is ever North South Australia like right here on this road I know this is a fake meta now with new Gen4 that's the only thing this could be really bad guess because it could easily be over here with this red soil or it could be like near Alice Springs but I think I'm gonna risk for the biscuit because why not oh let's go wow okay um honestly Ghana was the only bad guest I had today I've really I feel like I've seen the single yellow on like over here by Nantucket I really should have probably got better score there I'm kind of disappointed um but and all in all gone is probably my only really blundered there um but solid date we'll take it and I'm still hugging first so we'll take that um almost getting the right Road there um Ghana going Central I really need to learn my gun roads dude doing North Mass getting the right routine there in the US I kind of see how dude Blinky almost got a world record bro what the f uck he had three 5Ks all right how's the paper do jhk zigzag myself a pretty easy seed um I think if I if I had to Bear gone I guess it was getting better um zigzag obviously got the right South Australia right there everyone getting that yeah it's just the uh just the Israel or the uh gone I guess that comes down the scores there um but all in all pretty sooner date let's let's do I wish I could sort like lowest scores I would love to see who got the lowest score today did Joseph play today let me see if Joseph played today I told Joseph I'd look at his score I don't think he did Joseph bro you got you gotta get your funny up bro uh it takes too long to scroll man like I can't learn anything from 21ks you know just not possible it's not possible man it's just not possible all right so how's everyone's day going well good we'll do like 400th like I don't think there's anything learnable here though because 20K Price look at the right countries um before we go 420 how'd the 420 do remix congrats man um us Alabama there I used this is a thing where it's like um it's just these trees you know like I don't know how to describe it this architecture doesn't really feel like Alabama either feels way more North East um yeah can't describe it I don't know I wish I was better at describing everyone can go on a tape getting the essay Road nice okay there's nothing learnable here like North Mass going Bulgaria because they saw Cyrillic usually you have antenna in um Bulgaria so maybe that's a an instant a clue there but uh yeah all in all pretty standard date oblique is cracked and um I need to learn my Ghana but let me know if you guys see on today's um I don't think I read today that's good that's a dub um let me know how you guys down to days and good luck on tomorrows bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 32.54860943572693, "lng": 35.03979362702438}, {"round": 2, "lat": 41.5323310147248,

right we're back and say 42 every day upstairs playing instructions together and we not retailer because reading is cringe first game of the day you guys already know how we do it um what we got here we got Russia Gen4 Russia um it feels pretty North to me um is this ever gonna be near yet maybe that's my best guess currently I have some Russian baller to get the these chevrons not distinct to Russia at me thinks maybe they are I don't know I for Gore uh but yeah this is gonna be Russia it feels kind of like um something you could get something like northish over Ah that's Canada not going there something over here this in this region I know we know the the smoke coverage that you get in this region um so I don't know if this is currently that smoke coverage this feels somewhat cloudy um but maybe it's like fog I don't know if that's smoke but I think someone over here is my best guess so I'm gonna line the road up it's going pretty North South Royal summer here near yakuzik call it here in the 360. it could be a very bad guess because it's nowhere work to be a very good guess it was even more East we move on looks like we have an arch especially here gray hair black car overcast looks like it might have a black dot not license plate we have a black Don that license plate which means we are gonna be an arch it feels kind of like near Uruguay maybe somewhat southernish so black dot on license plates black car in South America is Argentina guys white but with the black dot we're gonna be in arge so we're gonna go somewhere I think over here and hope for the best was just downtown Uruguay next year we have a you guys already know um we always go see the mix together um so we have Gen 4 with short plate here equals um Mexico oh is that a pink taxi pink taxis r-n-cdmx uh Mexico City um I don't think I think that's just a pink car though I don't think that is a pink taxi um but yeah everything here leads to Mexico but you like like I said guys we always go see the mix together so if you guys didn't go see the mix here um you're being uh banned this is a mix pull as well with like the eight sides or however many sides it has it's like octagonal Um mountains are North I mean City Mexico could be a guess here um but we'll see a little more Southeast but picking up 4.5 K because we always go see the next together round four um I mean I immediately thought it's like Luxembourg um we have yellow back plates and yellow front plates and I think this is gonna be Luxembourg um I think you get these light posts like these dangly light posts very common Luxembourg as well um and this time we have in the distance here to our South you can see it's yellow with like the dangly uh pipes on the side that is a Luxe sign as well um so we will be in Luxembourg here we have French on the side maybe you guys are in France here oh the Lu that's awful um so maybe a lot of people dig at Luxembourg if they saw the domain but together somewhere over here super North and then we have an esotini I think um so pretty standard day today nothing too crazy um so driving left yellow outer lines here with tall grass acetone grass um it's kind of just a Vibe thing um but this grass is super common in eswa um if this is Pretoria you don't go Patrol together if it's not it's South Africa okay it's not South Africa um I hope it's not that'd be really awkward for the South African Pretoria but this is the ascertain somewhere um somewhere nothing too West I'll go like right here which is capital picking up a 20.1 21k today Russia guess um maybe she went more East if I was better at Russia I would have but uh Life Goes On how did I do against the homies I beat Demetra if there's Iggy How We Do How We Do How We Do CD Max um everyone see the Mex there you go in Russia we'll take it uh we got lots everyone Lux and yeah pretty soon your day going Arch uh who want your kids with me uh Dimitri himself went meet their mission Ziggy so very good uh very very good all right here we go here we go we got Max we got jhk CPE uh uh Blinky we look at Eamon pever we also yeah I told Joseph I would I would look at Joseph today but Joseph doesn't look he's in the top 100 today dizzy let me see if Joseph's here you see here he's somewhere here Joseph where are you never mind dude I um let's look at how they did yeah going east there wolves looks pretty easy just sitting here get 4500. everyone get asked for everyone getting Arch uh your score defines where you went in Russia today hopefully um let's see what we did wrong on some other players that's like 197th place 197 how we doing how we doing how we doing 197 197 197. 197. we already Kathy bar wait didn't I look at Kathy bar before what are the odds okay so they went uh Poland's here on uh Russia here um let's look at this lock again so yeah a big thing very Rush as well is you get these huge intersections um very common in in Russia that's another big tell um this Chevron is super common in Russia as well um but overall this um he did go south Poland so I mean maybe the hills um he knew Southland maybe had more mountainous but with these trees um very short Tree Line could usually be more north um and bollards these bollards aren't polish um we also have this Chevron right here which is like the yellow border super common Russia so um well I'll be in the carries again luxberg though GG is getting esportini thinking Arch so we'll play to this man slash woman um Let's do let's do one more let's do 240 second 242 242 242 trips how we doing trips how we doing got me tripping got me stumbling yeah so Gen 4 that coverage with like the north tree line kind of just feels like that more East area than me maybe it's a Vibe thing but um kind of explained it how you get that cam New Gen 4 covers over there but overall getting ARG and S patina here and Mexico City he went so looked up for the boys and girls today let me know how you guys did on today's and good luck on tomorrow's and I will see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 61.72107445750887, "lng": 152.31426184565424}, {"round": 2, "lat": -30.945458795744052, "lng":

back is a 41 are they playing series or something they're playing in searching to play that I play them are we learn together we go see an extra group tour together and we do not read together I always say we don't read together and I end up reading round one Spain probably unless we got here um we're at the triple White Road lines kind of common Spain kind of not common Spain and tandem means we're gonna be in Europe overall this like overall vegetation here feels pretty Spanish to me with these like uh trees on the side and everything like that what I'm currently looking for is like a hunting sign I think it could be Portugal it's probably never Portugal here I think I go Southwest Spain maybe oh maybe a little northernish yeah but I know these trees where they're like spares like this bars like this um very common Spanish landscape here um so yeah I don't know it's kind of just a region guess thing from here I like somewhere down southish maybe over here and pretty good pretty good guess um not too bad we'll take that next round um really we're gonna be in Europe I think this is like a North mass or like Serbia type type issue here looks like we have B type guard girls I think these B type guardrails are common in Serbia um what language we got here reading not reading um no antenna also means Serbia stop sign we've bollards up here to our West they kind of just look like bollards to me nothing just crazy back of the sign means nothing to me I know in some like creation some creation places you get like a sticker in the back of the sign um yeah I think we're being Serbia here like South Serbia is my best guess B type garfields are common in server you can see like uh they have like the indention right there I don't know my best guess um kind of going up fives that could work Loki and I'm going like somewhere down here and almost getting the exact Road oh my God uh okay all right let's keep it moving let's keep moving to Russia here snow coverage in Russia We Got The Pedestrian sign with the white border common in Russia also coming like some other countries um I got Cyrillic we got no blue strip in the plate I was doing so well and then I get a rush up man I was doing so well and I'm not gonna do so well here um I think it's been Western Russia show photo show um maybe not actually I don't really know where Western where coverage snow coverage is in Russia anymore um so my best guess is like outside Moscow somewhere over here like I said I had I my guess is because your guys is here to be honest is that mountain to our South actually no I'm going right here I don't know a little South outside Ukraine that's fine what is this Russia again white car Russia so we have white car I think with long antenna Russia which means we're gonna be like over here near chilobinsk or like super East on this road up here but I don't you also get some random other supplies but I think we might be near chill of being secure with white car Russia um sure I'll find North South Road near Chiller Banks I mean it could be anywhere down here I think I'm not really too sure it was a little more south but was it children's region um and we have the SK which is um black and yellow stripe poles that don't go all the way down the bottom beautiful location I must say so um yeah black and yellow stripe poles that do not go lay down the bottom winter coverage are coming in SK you click right here in the middle and you get pretty good score um but yeah that's about it the original guessing South Korea is impossible a little more south 22.2k on chemists from a Russia guests there not too bad I knew the white car Russia there and chilled Minsk so getting that um but assuming I had some homies do better um I got third here not too bad um white car is over here as well so aiming to do that most asking the children I me and Max early with going that far north i5kate Serbia I'm getting really close to Spain yeah I almost had a really really like one of my best days ever if it wasn't for that the northernish Russia gas right there but um what was my score um 22.2 not bad see how we did today zigzag he already looked at CPE Max the product John let's see what we did yeah going south there I think I think zigzag thought that was in Mount or South to Loki because I thought it was was it nah but he went caucus um generally it's pretty hedge there in Spain it's not Russia what was my what was the point in Russia 3.3 that was really my only bad guess 3.3 yeah um sucks it's okay everyone getting that yeah pretty common white car everyone getting I went a little too North there but it is in this challenge being screened in here um SK everyone since Center and overall again a pretty standard day my super guess is kind of cracked but uh we'll take it let me know how you guys did on to actually no before I do that we gotta look at um let's look at 142nd I'm assuming we're gonna have some Russia mess-ups um two rushes in one game you'll probably see some motor scores today so that's okay if you feel discouraged then you head to the 142nd oh blinkies down here had the Blinky dude uh Blinky went Ace on the white car there makes sense yeah that's only bad guess and caucus I think maybe they're what people must have those mountains South um yeah Croatia is not a bad guess usually you'll have antenna and Croatia it also doesn't really feel like Croatia oh Blinky started off really strong uh and then Russia hit um I'm bringing SK yeah on this one you don't get white car over here I don't think so um that's something important for Russia's white cars only really your children it's getting maybe really far east near these roads um getting Spain get caught there um not too bad pretty sooner date let me know how you guys on today's and good luck on tomorrow's this is also a great day I don't think I read once today we take those goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 39.49612875588979,

back is day 40 every day playing Thursdays every Sunday I put a link is here if you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn together we play together we go see Mexico we go Pretoria together we do not read together and we make a guesses together or bad guys together either is okay because if you make a guess all the time that's a really boring way to play the game right it's only fun when you don't know what it is hot take um let's start I've had crazy frog stuck in my head all day now dude I I don't know why you mentioned that but I I cannot stop think about Crazy Frog I'm driving right we got the Philippines action here um I'm gonna be honest but does this ever mean Cebu like we're on Cebu reading I I didn't mean to read okay I didn't mean to read oh it says Palawan it says Palawan and cebuana I mean I read guys okay palawan's here I don't know what cebuana means but I think palamon pawn shop surely means we're me and palomon right oh this is so cringe dude I I I'm actually scanning for a road right now bro what's that quote from that like that movie it's like yeah they're you either live long enough I don't know someone in the comments when they don't talk about I'm just going downtown Palawan somewhere um this is really good for reading this way you don't read if I didn't read that I'm sending Center Philippines there every single day in my life all right so we got these black and white stripe poles to get all the way we got these black might start poles um these are Peruvian um white car um pretty mountainous Hills um with snow capped um it feels like Bolivia low-key like it looks like Bolivia I'm gonna go pretty South here like pretty um like somewhere over here in this region don't know it's usually just isilima do not see it being that North at all um so I think this is a pretty safe guess I'm over here and it was dude I could not believe they're red dude I'm so cringe for that all right next round here looks like we had like a Polish these trees look pretty polish to me if I do say so myself um but it's just a forest but we do have the antenna which indicates we're gonna be in like probably Europe here obviously um birch trees crowded area it's like Road quality reminds me of something like polish I would see in Poland um I don't think it's gonna be sweet or anything like that with this road condition Road quality um I really think it has to be excuse me Poland um not sure what else it could be to be honest Famous Last Words is it ever anything Baltic maybe probably not in my opinion um I think we're gonna be in Poland here it could be something random like savini or something I don't we're probably used to pull him though I'm gonna go somewhere at Central and hope your best was this North we take those we got a little Swiss action a little sweat that Swiss Swiss Ash with some French is that fridge I'm not even cap I don't know I don't know my uh what was with me what is with me today dude I I that's cringe we're gonna Five Guys we're gonna Vibe I'm gonna act like I didn't see that dude I literally saw Palawan and sent Palawan bro I would have sent like I would I would have just sent like right here that's like a four nine um all right that's kind of an L plus ratio in my opinion because it's like almost as bad as me not going Pretoria um okay don't read don't read don't read I'm gonna go not Philippines here so Loki in Switzerland by the way you get the you can tell like the wide blur Quantum is gonna be uh Switzerland uh with these mountains going somewhere near burn for the best it was south then we got what we got here Final Round Here that's the most wait what let me let's check in right pH design we're in the Philippines just kidding um so CZ on the sign there uh Zona is super common uh we got the CZ on the back of the car there in the gates check Republic checking also it's like uh like this language is like like that just let's check in but um Gen 4 is also common in czechia in now Slovakia as well um I'm going like downtown Prague as I click east of Prague I don't think it looks like a pretty urban city um so I might just like go Capital guys some can't be cringe to be honest but it could be like some anywhere here maybe a center hedge I'll be like here it was just south 22.3 no real bad guesses on your boys end to be honest um besides my only bet I guess is because I read that's my only bad guess I'll be honest I I just read that's just a skill issue um let's see how the boys did um tripoda red with me shout out to traboda reading our Crane's reading Brothers um yeah I mean 22 20K nothing nothing to Fred over everyone getting East or South Peru uh uh yeah pretty standard guesses there from from everyone um let's see how we did on the leaderboard Ziggy messaged me and he said dude I played so well Bernie didn't get tough three bro and then friends they just got ratio by Max Naaman um aiming to really well maxed it really well Anna how did Anna do has a John Harvey Kellogg do the linky play today CPE is playing well hi CP U who else we got John we got PIV PIV dog who else we got who else we got we're at all the homies shown out today all the homies showing out today let's see we got um I'm assuming they're good scores moment Palawan yeah I'm this is what I don't read I I never I I've never gone Palawan in my life um just south checking it there uh maybe I should have read something there but that would have been cringe uh North Pole Philippines uh so yeah very I mean pretty standard seed all right let's see what we can learn from the 279th player It's Gonna be Me isn't it just kidding you guys remember uh you guys dude I went through like nostalgic songs and so I was listening to that crazy frog and then there's like this one from like the club penguin song oh my God what was it was like a puffle it was like waffles or pancakes or something oh dude wait that's gonna bother me wait I said Turner 79 we're in 379 because I'm already dude there's some people with good scores dude I can't learn anything from these guys all right you guys are too good um we need a harder seed like waffles I used to have waffles let's see how waffles did waffles went uh Peru or isolino and Peru why did I read all right shout out to my boy waffles he did well um I went to lock and pull in there my guess everyone sings it once you've seen it long enough it kind of just looks like Poland um plus those trees like polish let me know how you guys down todays um good luck on the morrows and I will see you tomorrow bye ", "locations":

back to day 39 I hope every day following series ever since I put Link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow we learn together we play together we go see the mix every group of tour together we don't cheat together we don't read together um but most importantly we learn together right that's what it's all about round one okay looks like we might have a user Canada um I think this is a maximum sign which is going to indicate we're gonna be in Canada um somebody told me on the last last one like NBA New Brunswick or something does not have a railroad or something like that so I'm not gonna go there this time make your comments for letting me know what else we got here um yeah it's just gonna be the maximum sign I I feel like it's gonna be somewhere in uh Quebec I can't see any French or anything like that though um we don't have the black strip on the bottom here which means we're not coming in Ontario um Paul's Bistro don't know the area codes but it feels like somewhere in like uh get back so I'm gonna go like outside Montreal um because it doesn't really feel like sass or anything over there to me at all okay it was just outside next round what is this um immediately it looks like Northern Spain or France wait we have black on the back of the sign there I mean Italy ever it's gonna look like Italy to me the housemate looks Italy though I can't shoot Italy here the black on the back of the sign makes you think my screens went black okay are we still recording I are still recording I don't know if you guys saw my screen just went black on me um but we do have black on the back of the sign here um guardrails do we don't have Spanish guardrails because Spanish cars have yellow tint so it has been like Italy I'm going maybe like over here unless it's France down here okay it was just Italy nice rounds here we got cement this is France we have the French baller this is definitely southern France here um I hope that's interesting I don't think I've ever seen that sign before I'm not gonna cat um so yeah French bollards you know you get the the thick ones the thickums so that's a that's a good thing um overall it's like overall very green and like kind of hilly makes you think southern France is why I said that um so I like somewhere down here um near Spain border I think so like I said very green hilly um big bollards um assumingly French French like France likes to use all caps too they like to yell at you so um okay it was just actually more North but uh pick up 42. we'll take it next round we got what we got what we got we got pulling we got the holy pole A-frames you see these uh poles right here um with the holes in their a and they're skinny it's a this is a very Polish thing so where we only go in Poland maybe someone Southern to be honest um slight Hills so I'm not gonna go too South maybe somewhere like over here in this region you're this town makes sense Maybe it makes sense to me maybe a little more North actually we'll go like right here a little more West we'll take it though in the final round we go to Brazil uh for me it looks like North Brazil to me um we got the ladder poles though these ladder poles are Brazilian um also if you look in the back of the signs maybe nope um Brazil uses black in the back of the Sun as well but overall it looks like we have some sand on the side right here it makes me feel more North overall through like the overall very flat um in this overall vegetation it was like maybe pie or like somewhere up here so maybe even more southish but I'm gonna go like right over here I think pretty North and hopefully the best here is it more North in uh near Berlin but 20 20K 21k will take it nothing too crazy um kind of getting the right region on every country I think so um overall dub but you know still marginal room for improvement um see how we did so CPE Max and Ruben did um CP did go or Max to go Connecticut there um only losing by uh my Southern France guess wasn't the best I'm actually Serbia makes sense no antenna I think it's what we is maybe why um yeah we have no antenna in the car maybe it does indicate serious he went Southern serve as well but I think the black in the back of the sign there is what made me go over um but yeah let's um let's go down to the very bottom here and see how jhk did zigzag o um pivor the Blinky plate Blinky uh oh Blinky didn't play let's see jhk nice guess uh maybe my Southern France gets in the best all game Italy oh I'm the only one calling South Poland we'll take it um maybe we're going Central have one USA guess um but everyone getting kind of the right region there um pretty standard pretty standard um and let's look at the 195th X that's oh wait who's that Axel GG's axle let's see how let's do 200 27th 227 well we'll go through their guesses shall we um Justice 99 when USA like I said I think the biggest indicator for me for USA here because it did kind of look like USA and there wasn't really French so um I understand what maybe people in the US I think for me mom where are we the sun back here I think it was a maximum sign I'm assuming most people didn't see that but it looked like it said maximum on it not speed limit so um yeah also like usually in the US you get these polls as well I think Canada more commonly uses with impulse but um yeah it does kind of look like the US to be honest it doesn't even look like key back to you guys there's like no French anywhere so obviously you know we weren't really we're in Ottawa so that's why you have to well actually and uh comments Virginia yep two virginias there um France Italy kind of all go in the same region so um only real blunder by our boy there was just uh the us but yeah great job man um let's do one more let's see one more let's do one more let's do 342nd 340 second here we got who we got Erica Wong how we doing Erica went hungry so yeah the black in the back of the signs is Italy Romania Albania so um that's the base indicator for that for that um if you have that sign I'm not sure all this would have went Italy um but yeah keep that in mind Italy Romania Albania Romania um in Europe I should say so black on the back signs is those Theory getting Poland knowing the polls great job and um getting out of it so great work where is the blender huh great work um wow if the 342nd best guesses is making those type of guesses you guys are cracked so uh um ggs let me know how you guys did on today's and good luck on tomorrow's bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 44.93376557424526, "lng":

right back to 38 every day following series every Sunday we learn daily go see Mexico together and we don't read together oh I'm gonna call some people out I saw the top comment last in yesterday's video with someone saying oh how do you not get embossed it was right there on the truck are we just like self ex like self-admitting now like bro cringe have you ever done something from a girl no this is Andorra nice we'll take it just kidding um this ain't worth it I think it should be Endura um very very common you get this like endorum brick um it looks like you know the mountainous hills around this is like and where it is like they must have like some sort of like uh like law against like making Ugly Houses banned because everything is so beautiful in the Underworld you like it's just the brick it's very distinct architecture very very small country so you plunk in the middle and get a very good score I would bet my life savings that Blinky 5K this I would put everything I own um kind of cringe I'm just kidding but yeah very very common you get this brick in Andorra um and it's like over an architecture so we send down south you know for the best and we take it because it was that down south round two we have in Australia how we filming today on our Aussie how are we feeling today a little possum guard not the Tasmanian possum guard did not be confused pretty non um descriptive Australia for like no markings on the polls Von dilt norum coramble I didn't it feels like uh kind of like South in this W or like nsw to me it could be I don't think it's Vic doesn't get any stuff you somewhere to me uh I'm not the best officer I feel like I'm pretty decent but I'm not the best you know by any means there's people a lot better than me um but it does feel like kind of like in his dubs you know so I think that might be the best guess I have we'll go somewhere like uh near Wagga Wagga I'm just kidding I've always wanted to say that on this video Waka Waka we'll go like right here maybe more flat you know hopefully the best and it was Brisbane New Zealand let's see if we can guess New Zealand today um we got blue signs very distinct to Nowhere these uh ballards that go red to Red in the end are in Zed so also if you have red text on the giveaway sign that's gonna be New Zealand Australia uses black text driving left I'll get indicators here I feel like we're gonna be pretty I feel like this is North Island to me um maybe like South North you know I'm not the best at Region guessing North Island or New Zealand either so I'm going for an L here but this feels like it could be somewhere around here I guess it could easily be southbound as well um I think New Zealand's a very bait location to be honest there are they have a lot of bait where to be like kind of either one or the other I don't think there's anything here that really screams to me you get these signs everywhere in New Zealand so those aren't distinct so we'll go like right here and hope for the best it was Nelson North is South still picking up points next round here what we got oh this is a where is it this dry and rush into it I go like downtown Mongolia here surely right um or like super South maybe is a better option um eight area code doesn't really mean much to me Cyrillic plus Russia so my two options are gonna be like down here like over here in this region I think is where it's probably more more likely or over there but I'm gonna go down here I think where it's like super dry um so yeah that's my best guess I got I cannot read sir like I do not know my Russian error codes but um and quite frankly if you guys watch my main Channel video oh these are cool stairs that's kind of sick um but yeah Russia like plus no blue serpent license plate um Ukraine you'll see the Ukrainian flag and um Russia or a Bulgaria has a blue strip as well as like Serbian other I'll move down here though uh sure yeah it was even more south like downtown Georgia uh it makes sense next round what we got what we got we got it's like Gen 4 Kenya like North and Nairobi and NPC nope this is uh wait why this looks like an NPC came into me but no she's gonna be South Africa it's not here it's not here it's not but we always go for tour together I knew it was North um okay did not go Victoria you're a loser Eamon did not I I don't want to be your friend if you're not going to like play with me dude like I sacrificed all my points for why for why for why my Australia guess was the only thing that really blundered me there um so everyone getting down south Russia and bringing Andorra everyone getting I would mean Ziggy down there you know we're just chilling down here um chilling chilling like a villain um very marginal scores between uh lots of lots of scores here so nothing too crazy I'm just kind of sad My Homies didn't go Victoria I actually kind of tilted foreign guys why are we try Harding a daily challenge bro okay what about wow did Blau Victoria okay I've been there done that bugs bugs also an ascertain nizzle why is everyone going S4 thank you oh my God who is this what was her name Curry thank you all right let's see who else what was my score what was my what was my Victoria score my tour score was 4100. nope nope this year cheated did Hitler scope a tour when he cheated at least a cheater went Victoria that even the cheaters go Pretoria like what a g bro he cheated the whole Lobby and then went to Toria that guy's a legend bro new boy T bro what a legend um who else we got let's look at let's just review 119th Place actually I'm probably above 119th did zigzag go Pretoria we did in Australia so that makes sense all right I'm let me know how you guys doing today's and good luck on tomorrow's goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

"we're back it's a 37 today playing search everything they pulling his shirts you guys play today I play tomorrow we don't either play the other we go see him actually we have a tour together and we do not read together because you're reading this cringe I'm gonna make sure I don't do that today um I used 100 000 Subs on this channel which I think is uh insane I'm not sure I didn't think I was gonna I I was just gonna say that but now I'm like that's insane um I if you guys enjoy like the cgo guesser have such a cool audience behind it now is so fun um and to be someone like a spokesperson for this game I'm extremely honored because it's such a privilege to play so thank you everyone that watching these videos and uh I promise I'll continue my best to to be somewhat of a light in this community as much as I try so Let's see we got today we got some little uh Kenya action I think I'm kind of tired I just play the attorney um we'll see I think this is a Kenya follow car driving left with a yellow plate Kenya drives left because it's on the right side of Africa a good way to learn that's how I learned Uganda and Kenyan Drive left because it's on the right side and the Nigeria had gone in single Drive left because on the right side but it doesn't really work now since Rwanda does drive right I think but anyways we're gonna be in Kenya here um man's probably should just go I'm gonna refresh and get a little bit of lag if you guys get Lagos or just refresh and should be clean this feels maybe a little more West to me so I need to go a slightly more West in Nairobi still kind of dry though so we'll see oh I just cheated bro look at this I'm cheating okay sorry oh is it sent Mombasa nah I never get my boss of there no Kizzy all right we move on um like I said my brain is fried right now that's English we're gonna be in the UK or Ireland obvi probably just the UK driving left no yellow stick or anything like that feels British feels like Welsh or something with a everything I could see there like I said that's the best we might have Timothy David's running through a filter out here somewhere that might make sense so I'm gonna go like over here it was a little more North we'll take it we got Uruguay um so very common you're glad you get these white big poles um yeah I'm trying to have a trident Pole or anything like that doesn't look like we do usually they have like Trident poles where it's like a like this and it has like a t going up like that right um you also kind of get like overcast coverage in Uruguay as well so and if you see a cow it's probably Uruguay so I'll get indicators um you always go to the middle and hope for the best here unless it's north it looks like a little North Cape action driving left to go outer lines oh wait I have to do it I can't now do it again I don't think it's there but if it we always give a tour together dude I think I have to take the L even if it's it could be it could be if it was maybe more it feels more this region but we always go Victoria together we always go Victoria together it feels like it's gonna be somewhere down here but we always have a tour together I'm gonna check who's loyal okay whose sacrifice your points for me we'll see what we got next we got kirg is this a South car I oh today is the day I get the South car right right I mean the reflection of the mirror usually you can't see the road in the South car I think that's the way it works on the left side mirror um you get Kirk you get Yelp you get these red strips and license plates it doesn't like Albania and Kyrgyzstan um but yeah you got the roof rack as well here which is curve also very common curvy like white painted trees on the bottom things like that um so in the South the car that has like that mirror if it is the right one I could it could be completely north I'm kind of like my brain scattered but it's like that from like right up here to this road down to Ash so I'll find somewhat roads going east west I just feel like right here it was just outside OSH NBA present score really only blunder was Kenya I mean we always go for tour together so I had to sacrifice the points there and I got the right uh it's the South car in Kyrgyzstan there so we'll take it all around um I just want to see if um the Chumlee guptoria Chumlee my Victoria did Amy guptoria eamon's band tripod is banned all right how do we do how did um who we got who we got who we got all right we're gonna see how the 100 do we have blinkier anyone here's a blank you'll see how Blinky did first um he also went yeah that's a very weird boss so I'm assuming no one did that but like he didn't go for tour it kind of fake of him um a 5k Uruguay okay dude um yeah he went North uh all around great he's probably 5K OSH too yeah great great work there by him um very blanky moment all right let's see how the um 119th person if they went Victoria you if you think of Pretoria of the product is the 100 this is not scripted this isn't scripted it's the product fake 222nd there's like a big party going outside my house right now and it's like um 22nd how did this man do Sam let's go that's my boy that's my boy let's go hey that's a dump Dub's in the chat all right and Let's do let's just do a little guess answering let's take someone's guest down here um actually these people all did better than me so we'll see uh we'll go down let's go to like an 18K score and see if uh see if what maybe like one mistake or two if someone did that's gonna take forever do some people play these so cool I was so young Finn did let's see if there we can learn anything from Young Finn um usually you would see mountains to the South here unless if you were enlisted too if you're gonna be North Hills there you probably see mountains super flat so we don't really go anywhere near Lucy border there um so let's take a call out there you get super in the honestly if it looks exclusive too big mountain ranges here so I don't know how you go Kenya or Mombasa there it's kind of crazy yeah the South car you don't see the road as much all around they went great there yeah same there Isle of Man usually has Gen 2 coverage I think they have different plates as well I don't think we could have seen that though all around yeah pretty standard gases so um yeah and I called out the Uruguay differences there um the big thing about Uruguay well is it overcast and the um this road lines you get these in args as well but they're common in Uruguay as well so solid date let me let me know how you guys did on today's good luck on tomorrow's and I'll see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -3.754323832537253, "lng": 39.82390176065014}, {"round": 2, "lat": 53.91754706274631, "lng": -2.698749488911628}, {"round": 3,

right we're back to say 36 of the appliances play today I play tomorrow we learned the other play together we're gonna see the exhale together and we have zigzag with us together what's good everyone how we doing zigzag series finally back from his Europe trip that was immediately as he lands I said get on the daily challenge I need you so I've literally not slept in 45 hours but let's get it um I'll put a link in the description you guys probably do um crazy against her stuff I'm currently recording this a day before because I'm going to twitchcon tomorrow for one day don't worry I'll be we'll be back for the tournament Saturday but let's do this shall we I heard it was a decent decently easy seed so hopefully we don't we don't mess up um I'm sure we're just gonna make one guess together so we should we caught up the mind games play on us here we just have to play it like it is exactly exactly all right don't reverse psychology [ __ ] okay let me leave a white car um this feels like kind of like like Peru Bolivia border or something like that doesn't it feels Eastern Peru for sure is it ever even Bolivia I don't think so yeah does the number plate have a slight blue tinge to it because they use the blue ones there I think it might be Oblivion number plate to be honest so it does like I was trying to think of where improved this could be and like I feel like this this house looks more Oblivion I'm not too sure though yeah yeah yeah I'd agree I'd agree so maybe just on the border or something like that yeah I mean it's never like over here near Santa Cruz I think uh yeah no I don't think so but hey hey famous last words are right I always yeah I think my clothes here I think I think like uh yeah 10 seconds it's not that mountain that's there so maybe do we even have mountains sir yeah see it oh wow okay so I always get confused with the Gen 4-2 I mean this is just an Austrian slash Slovenian baller I would assume we're gonna say something here with aw covers though um I'm not sure I'm I'm wondering I'm wondering that as well it's it's uh it's kind of a tough tough round isn't it I mean we're gonna get good points for the questions which country difference I don't know if they have one usually Oscar I think they're more like a nipple top so yeah that's true so so do we have an antenna though as well we don't you definitely do see no antenna in Slovenia for Gen 4 as well but yeah it's maybe more common in Austria I think it's Slovenia though I mean it's ADW Slovenia coverage is kind of like a Ice Cube Center here I think I know yeah we still pick up like 45. and it was just yes all right okay I mean it's my ends tell me where to go yeah uh uh so we've got some ocean yeah ocean to the South here oh is that yeah Southeast yeah kind of thing okay so that that definitely Narrows things down does it not um okay so it could be on the York peninsula here I could definitely see that I just flew over there today and I was watching it from the plane oh that's that one that you have your cursor over here yeah and it actually could be uh no it actually could be the next one over to the uh West as well one of the two I think um oh dude dude I can think of a number of places this could be huge well we got 20 seconds yeah yeah I I I don't mind that at all what does it say on that camper van um to the yeah that one there yeah in the south yes we've got those South Australian poles we know we're in the right state but look you want to go here yeah I don't mind that at all to be honest Maybe yeah oh nice nice nice fantastic I literally was looking at that uh town from the air today I'm not sure exact Town serendipitous is that I know I know it's absolutely crazy um actually a good result as well good switch Yeah Yeah what is this antenna France I imagine we had French cars um as well yes this looks like a French back there it looks like we don't even have the blue on this okay so what's your region guess yeah um like Loki North I think I'll say Central maybe but North also makes sense because it's very green it feels like it gets a lot of rain it looks I think more Central yeah yeah um also I'm always down to go Central you know me my hedges yeah yeah I actually think it makes sense the other because it the architecture doesn't feel all the way North to me at least but yeah yeah I'm down let's try it we got 10 seconds on the clock I'm going somewhere I think I quite like that I like that yeah we're gonna go in this town right here it's for the 5K oh yeah not bad not bad not bad just down south picking 4 500. what round is it like yeah 4 500 on France is actually more respectable than it seems I feel like definitely location um region doesn't care how you feeling exceptionally bad actually um oh gosh I mean I just go I just click on the center risky Northeast no no I was actually kind of thinking the same thing I can't lie let's just do it let's just do it for the content yeah yeah if we both thought let's do it no no I'm actually calling it it's all right trying to upon it yeah I don't think anyone's played it really yet I know oh there okay we got two um okay yeah and Bolivia I think that's like the first place I'm a second first place in France almost yeah we're gonna get first in France so they need a classic just in your hedge SK I probably see some Center Hedges yeah bro come on I mean did we all do we all do it uh okay this is popping off straight up uh oh we got Blinky too let's look at Blinky and JK and Kodiak wow we got the whole Squad already bro okay okay let's see okay Kodiak in his in his bag too that means again the same guess everyone going at least everyone getting South Australia obviously that would be bad if they were yeah um yeah and they got the peninsulas as well based on the uh Easter water there which is basically only found in those two places so it makes sense um and we did see like the land of the East as Welsh I'm assuming was yeah you can see it on a good day you can see it that's right so I was trying to find something that lined up but that makes sense honestly this makes sense as well probably uh yeah yeah I was I was honestly I'm glad that I didn't say anything but I was honestly learning that that way well I was wrong indeed yeah it's a central SK um everyone being slow and everything in France Blinky the French man himself getting closest to there a pretty good guess not bad and look at Luke definitely not cheating by the way um wow great job 14 seconds I think he's the new Rainbow if you ask me that's uh 14 seconds you can do it 0.1 probably 24. the 5K essay wow [Applause] you're the script offset all right um zigzag thank you for playing I know it's like super short super fun um subscribe to zigzag you

right say 35 for deal Punk series or something like description let's play I play more good story other great we go see next Saturday we learn the other play together and we don't shoot together or read together because that does cringe first game of the day I'm feeling like a million bucks I saw some comments saying um a little 2K 6K Andy so hopefully um I don't get a sub par score here round one it's just going to be a Brazil we have the Brazilian pole here which is a good indicator feels some somewhat dried me but also pretty heavily forced it so maybe they don't go too far north pretty green is there any area codes or anything my media thought here is like token teens or something a little more south actually 30 seconds on the clock like the Party Don't Stop got Palms satellite dish very nondescript round these pulls don't mean anything to me um I think I just go outside like golias something like that it doesn't feel too north but kind of North to me um kind of safe hedge here so Brazil I suck at don't take my word here best I can offer is the Brazilian pulse here it was just para interesting um it wasn't worth that makes sense driving left here I'm going to be in Indonesia um we're in Indo do I only go I'm sorry I'm thinking here I want to go Sumatra no maybe just Java here I think yellow plates on utility trucks didn't do I'm going south Sumatra I think now I'm going Java actual job like to be like anywhere here though I saw smash I guess we've been good picking up 5K going around three let's go we have an Ireland slash UK here um I almost want to go Ireland here just because I'm already kind of down bad so might as well just commit right so with these Hedges and this like overall these Hedges inside this room very Irish and British British huh in it White House maybe just uh I mean it could be like Wells or something I'm just gonna go Ireland it's probably not even Ireland though to be honest but I'm so down Badger now I don't care it's a 50 50 in my opinion very nondescript is it ever an Irish poll it is now I feel like both my guesses all my guesses have been like I was like oh it could be Wells or it could be Ireland it could be South Sumatra I'm not gonna go south Sumatra what was my first guess it could be North this is Italy or Spain wait what if black on the back of the sign which makes you think Italy but why is sp 24 I don't know what that means let's go daily here this is it might be the biggest blunder ever happens happens because I posted I don't think I've ever seen black and back of signs not in in Spain okay I'm just dumb no fronts with maximum there's no black strips they're not going to be in Ontario SAS doesn't have front BC doesn't have fronts I think to always go saskar you really look like Sask it's never East it's never easy it's another Sask I really should spend like 20 seconds and learn which promises provinces in Canada have fronts because it feels like I'm going to go like I don't know if Alberta does so I'm gonna go like Western and Sask because then no SAS doesn't I know BC doesn't then he's got Alberta right it's in between the two now I'm going now I'm going Alberta was Alberta okay um horrible day get up early there at the end I should have went more North in Brazil hard call out though um Ireland Wells I feel like I've I've done that like all the time and just a West Sumatra there no employed I'm assuming most of my friends are very quick how did jhk do I'm gonna start a new thing he did great great job Jake keep the great work King um this I was a repeat I forgot by the way this was in the world a record I know someone one of the you guys are Pros can let me know which record this was in but the person got this wronged in like a very high streak and I think they went Malaysia it was very weird someone could let me know which one I'm talking about because that was a repeat I forgot where it was though um yeah nearly there the water hedge by John Harvey Kellogg well that's kind of alpha kind of alpha by my man's overall I missed my Brazil gas region guest Endo bad and it went Ireland on Wales common rookie mistake I'm gonna do a new thing where I'm gonna look at a random person's score and we're gonna go through their guesses and see how we could have done gotten better um how we could have improved how could we have improved today boys and girls let's go to 209th 209th we're gonna look at today let's see how they did the giant 19. let's see how they went check you on um England so you know good call on check yeah check it does have Gen 4 coverage so that's not bad very green the overall the hedges on the side of the road here these are very Irish and uh um you get these in Ireland and Britain sometimes in France as well so keep that in mind um this isn't gesturing by the way this is guest learning I've got Italy King and got Alberta King and got Brazil I guess better than me in Brazil but they went South Africa on Indo that's where they messed up um they saw we were driving left which is good but overall you'll never really get this like this Greenery or these uh uh something keep in mind too is these gutters on the side of the street here oh they probably thought that was a white car or something these gutters on the side of the street are super common in Southeast Asia so if you have these inside you're gonna be like Philippines Indo Malay Thailand maybe things like that so these gutters on the side are very common plus um yeah um very green very uh like these are very common into as well so um yeah not too bad great work Mr giant 19. you guessed better than me on all of them almost had seen you guessing Alberta there so that's shabby let's do one more let's do 295th calling it call my shot this isn't guest chaining don't film discouraged East German bear how do we do gut Indo where'd they mess up they went check it there we know they went iron where'd they mess up Ah that's where they messed up Canada can they mess up in Canada and Brazil um honestly I wish I had something let's do jhk bro this dude um yeah overall these trees to me didn't really feel like Eastern I'm not considering act like I'm a Canada Pro but like this tree right here felt more Western to me um yeah I don't know if New Brunswick or Nova scotia's front plates either but I know Sask DC I think and that bird it don't so let's get call out but uh all around I feel like most people are doing really well it's just one guess that they get kind of blundered on so um keep up guys good luck on tomorrow let me guys how you guys did on today's and I'll see you tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -2.504511800757881, "lng": -54.95275805598617}, {"round": 2, "lat": -1.104600573154356, "lng": 100.7797922208109},

right we're back it's a 32 of the daily series episode links from you guys play that I play tomorrow we learn together we play together we always go Victoria together we always go see next together we don't read reading is cringe let me make a guesses together again yesterday I'm sorry I lost sleep last night I nothing was on my mind besides not good Victoria we're gonna make up to date I have this theory that I want to talk about that I think my skill significantly decreases the longer I spend on the round I I I truly truly believe that we have friends here by the way we have the French Bollard blue sticker and double blue on the back of the sign here um I think it's something North I would immediately just go here I have a click like right here right and I think that's a decent score right if I thought about it I'm like okay maybe we're gonna be like near Belgium right this could be near like North Belgium right or this could be like over here the more I think the less I know I truly believe that I'm gonna play some games after this I think it's like the ranked competitive and like I think my score is like it's 15 second games I think my score is significantly higher than it is if I played normally this is gonna be like Vic or something at least it feels like Vic to me um driving left we have double white outer lines here uh triple white red lines um I can't see any plates I think that's a big Pole to be honest um it feels like Vic to me it could be like in somebody or something honestly almost really looks the same kind of trash um but these trees kind of feel like to me not too sure not too sure why so it's like that journal region um no real palm trees so I don't think we're gonna be like near Queensland or anything to North um and if this was estoby we would be in South Australia so I like Vic here I'm gonna go somewhere over here on this M31 and it was the M31 and Vic round three let's keep it going we got Taiwan we got the yellow and black poles to go all the way down to the bottom equals Taiwan South Korea and Japan have similar ones but they do not go down the bottom uh mountains to the South here in the Kate um maybe I think we're more southern-ish I mean obviously all of Taiwan you get uh you get the amount is all East here um I don't know I think it's fine if I just go like right about it it was super South next round here it looks like we got uh driving right with the uh the back of the car here when you get this like black in the back of the car this is a Philippines car so uh plus you're driving right um in this road condition and you get a bunch of Tuck talks as well these thingies um with like a motorcycle um and the Tuk Tuks super super common in Philippines like Sri Lanka uh Peru and maybe like over here in Mexico but they're super common in Philippines and I think they're actually very learnable learnable um there is I don't know um I don't even know anything about it to be honest but you can actually actually learn how to guess in Philippines based off of talk talks in different regions um but we did Mount this to the South here I'm gonna go somewhere near Manila because I'm just kind of a coward like that um it's kind of the same thing as always vanilla the other kind of the same Vibe um no palm trees and then there's a little bit of palm trees here I don't know it was just North Manila and that is where I guess that last time where it was actually down south here but it was in my head next round here around five can I do it stay the day that conquer Canada I think it is I think it is um because I'm gonna Manifest this I'm gonna Manifest this I think we're gonna be in Ontario or uh oh dude dude what is that sign that green oh my God the green and white triangle is is is is is is is is distinct to it is oh my God I'm stuttering this green white triangle on the edge of Roads is like distinct to Ontario or Manitoba I forget or was it Sask oh dude I have it right on my phone I was literally just looking at this oh I'm I'm gonna this is bad what was it this green and white sign was it Ontario I think it's Ontario I'm going near Thunder Bay let's go let's go that's how we do it well I get what a decent day what a decent day um so I think I'll go back and look but um I got first dude life is crazy dude life is crazy decent guesses all around um yeah how'd I do in the top everyone here is cheating um this guy used my profile picture cheats and then he says he doesn't cheat kind of weird Jan nice job uh Max I already got Max how did we got like Blinky or someone do we got John Harvey Kellogg what's up Liam nice little profile picture I think you're not cheating Liam um the top 200 is it Blinky not play today brother Blinky Blinky man Blinky there's Ziggy feels bad man I see how there's Ziggy and jhk did I got what like 17. in reality that's probably I think that's first I think this is our second I think Jan probably got first maybe someone up here got a good C2 as well so I don't disagree you guys um I probably got top five though I'm not major people are probably cheating though um next to CL um this guy I'm gonna call this guy this guy right here absolute herb I don't like giving cheaters to recognition because it's kind of cringe but this guy posed his daily challenges on YouTube and cheats in them and acts like they're real like dude weirdo Behavior bro weirdo behavior and he's like trying to be nice to me dude like weirdo I don't like you you're weird okay uh let's see how uh I have a soft spot which I I don't have I have this like thing for cheers where like I absolutely despise anyone that tries to cheat on Google Maps game because Integrity of this game is so important because it's so easy to cheat and the one that tries to to bypass that is so weird in my opinion and I think deserves um no happiness okay so we do have um everyone gonna feel it here I'm at North there kind of getting the win there being South Philly I'm assuming we all went Ontario that's good more West though so I really did win here on the Western Ontario guests there so we'll take it I'll show you guys what I meant by the green light triangles um overall I think these like rocks inside the road here this is maybe weird too but I think these are common in Ontario's I think wise well I said that but this green and um white diagonal um like a sign here is distinct to Ontario um that's very very helpful clue I think these guardrails where it's like wasn't like that might be like an anterior clue as well but not too sure but um it felt like Western Thunder Bay version to me so that's why I went there um all in all like a very good day we'll take it um let me see if I can play is anyone in matchmaking I'm gonna I'm just gonna enter a ranked game real quick and play one more ranked game um so if you guys don't know I um there's a Discord now where you can play for incompetitive games um so uh I'm gonna try and play one real quick let me see if I can install um well I'm waiting actually I'll just cut to what I'm I'm cutting it I'll just cut until I'm in the game so I'll see you then okay so we just found the point that we have we're facing we're wondering Anna I don't think I'd be Anna here so oh we got South Korea beautiful location and if you're watching this amazing location um 15 seconds on the clock like the Party Don't Stop is this Hungarian what what is this bro I go hungry here I'm not too sure what this is though it was hungry okay decent score so far um new Canyon coverage I don't know where in Canada this could be though what does that say I have to guess I'm going outside my Nairobi private I don't know where that would be boarding school sure I just assumed boarding school maybe more uh maybe the South Sweden three spots up with red I don't know what that means I'm gonna accept the it was this Brazil uh no this is Chile with water to the West obviously or northish you gotta say Santiago ah she knew it I think I lost Gigi's uh yeah I lost everyone 900 points we'll play the annex well played uh getting the reason they're beautiful occasion great guess Anna gather around hungry and she got me sweet it's all around great game well played I'm gonna maybe do one of these rank games a day to see how I do I just lost um how much did I just lose I lost sexy though did you saying it and also good luck on the Mars Challenge and let me know how you guys did on today's bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 45.41104236443102, "lng": 5.016800731229603}, {"round": 2, "lat": -36.08284888170444, "lng":

right we're back is a 32 every day like series one day I play against here if you guys play today I play the more we learn another replay together we go see the max the other good Pretoria together we never read together because reading is cringe and reading is cheating if you read your loser round one I am ready to get a good score today this is going to be turkey I think like West turkey that's my best guess I got I'm not too sure uh is it ever grease or anything what language is this it does not look Greek we have no intent on the car here um which maybe indicates more likely turkey we have water to our South though blue stir from the plate means we're gonna be in Europe um architecture feels Turkish to me we have these water tanks which are very Turkish like the on the top of the roofs uh like those thingies very very common water this South in Turkey I like somewhere over here on this Coast so we're gonna go over here the best guess I got a little more North but we'll take it round two is this new gen for Kenya so if you guys don't know Google did release new coverage and um uh Kenya Nigeria and Senegal where you um you get new coverage and now you get um this car with a one in ten sometimes that's two and you also get this follow car in in Kenya as well there's like a silver follow car um this was Western to me because we have these like crops so I would probably go west Kenya here it's very green I don't know I I haven't studied new Kenya that much I've just kind of looked at a couple roads to see like what follow cars and intense and stuff look like but you do get this follow card common in Kenya and it's and you get this antenna sometimes there's two or sometimes there's one sometimes there's zero uh but with these crops I would probably go Western King here where there's more like a vegetation things like that and it was just Western Kenya round three we have an Iceland okay you know what this feels like it feels like this uh over here near this ringy of like thingy so I'm moving outside Reykjavik um is there anything for me to scam for foreign true um I don't know guys I uh yellow bollards are equal uh Iceland as well I'm sorry I'm to explain more um these yellow bollards are only in Iceland um so it's a very big clue you also get long antenna in Iceland and these blue signs with the yellow text are very common in Iceland as well sometimes you get blue text blue sign with the Altex I think in Greece as well but this um is distinct to Iceland as well I like the region I'm in it maybe it's a little more North but I think over here in Reykjavik is a safe guess and it was a good guess we'll take it let's finish out strong here shall we in Romania we have the Holy poles here um where you see this concrete with the Holiness going through you can see them here as well so it all indicates Romania I like Eastern Romania here not too mountainous they're not going anywhere Central like uh I don't think in this range here I like somewhere along here maybe here maybe here but I like Eastern Romania here more than anything I think maybe near Moldova not too sure uh but yeah are gonna be in Romania yeah that's the best I got guys um this holy poles you get these are hungry and Poland as well uh usually Romania paints white on the bottom of their pools not always but it is a good hint it was downtown aldova I should have maybe went there but that's okay and um final round here um if you guys are new to this I mean is it ever actually I think this is between your grass if this is South Africa then don't go Pretoria and let you guys down I'm so sorry okay I'm just going for dornt Port because that feels espatini grass like this tall grass inside feels like eswatini oh but this is very easily just be South Africa I mean I think this is us with this grass to be honest right I'm left with this white car um and these tree lines to our North it feels as well we get those like scatter trees together it can easily not be it could easily be somewhere in um South Africa but oh no Pretoria no we always go Victoria again a little bit I can't believe I've done this oh no we always go over Tori together we always go for tour together very easy seed um I can't believe I want s with there got Western Kenya if I went Victoria dude if I went with Victoria I don't know if I can post this how did Lisa Chumley bro in Greece because Victoria dude I can't believe I think of Victoria I think of Pretoria all right let's see how the paddock uh let's see how Max I think I saw Max let's see how Anna did Anna's here skin Anna let's see I can't believe it didn't go for Toria bro oh dude that's so bad I thought that was for sure man that's just so cringe uh we always go Victoria together dude we always Whip or Tori together we always go between I can't believe I went s with dude we always go Pretoria together dude oh my God I'm actually so upset you have like oh dude okay I played that I played that perfectly until then like I I was on Pace for it was my score yeah I was playing I was playing very well like I was gonna get uh that would have been the 4.5 I would have got 700 points so we got 20 23 won uh yeah that was always got third fourth ah I can't believe I can go Pretoria we always we learn together we play together we always go Pretoria together and I said we don't read together I started reading ",

right it's day 28 every daily I put a link in the description you guys play today I play tomorrow which is today and you guys click the link description and play tomorrow and then I play the next day and we learn together and we play together and we make the guesses together but most importantly let's go back to the roots we learned together okay no bad guesses No guest shaming everyone gets something wrong eventually I hope I'm not playing on blink mode here for one seconds we're in Norway how far south and Norway are we in though is the question I'm gonna go Trot time I think we'll see we'll see so immediately we have these yellow dashed these white Dash airlines that are slightly longer in length we have some red architecture and very Norwegian Hills I don't think it's too far south I don't don't think it's me western-ish I don't think it's gonna be near Bergen Maybe uh I'm gonna go in between Bergen and Trondheim I think maybe even more salad actually I don't think it's that far these mountains uh I'm gonna go over here I think this makes sense it's also just kind of a safe hedge in a certain Norway I don't think it's too far north usually like very far north you don't get these many trees things like that so I think we'll be pretty South here but that could not age very well at all and it aged pretty well getting 100 kilometers away round two we're in the Netherlands wait is this the same Dutch brick from episode 26 it was round three we're in Singapore oh my God guys we're going for a high score today um so Singapore drives the left you get these like very like uh nice looking houses very very clean um keep in mind Singapore does use English so you'll see things like slow and hump on the side of the roads um these green signs right here with like the white border are also very common in a very distinct to Singapore um these are Singapore street signs so um I'm not gonna try and find Kasai road but we're gonna go somewhere in the neighborhood here um and get a pretty good score because Singapore is like two inches long yep round four we have a turkey looks like um so you get these the Turkish ballards we got right here which um we had like the red strip you see these are white and red chevron's comet in Turkey but you also see these in like South Africa or Southern African countries so but that is a good sign for turkey as well and we have some like green Rolling Hills with like some like low vegetation I think we're gonna be somewhat East here oh I'm Angelo sure I hope you're not watching this dude I hope you're not watching um we're gonna go somewhere over here I think it could be a very bad guess I'm not the best at Turkey honestly I'm kind of a winter candy with Southwest turkey if the Southwest turkey and kind of trash uh I'm gonna go somewhere over here kind of risky but I think it can be I think it makes sense it was downtown in car around five we're gonna be in Japan is that a virtual strip again guys I think it's I think it's in my head I think it's in my head um so we're gonna go uh I mean it was like north of fuku Fukushima right so we're gonna go here hope for the best I hope that's the white vertical strip that is north but we also have low cam Japanese architecture so these are very common in Japan as well these like red uh boxes metal thingies okay 19 seconds on the clock like the party don't stop let's go right here 20K um all in all not a bad day um let's go to my friends here I'll go through I went so far north for no reason eamon's East with me um I'm the owner in the room that repeat what I'm getting close to Norway oh yesterday I mentioned No guest streaming um this was a very easy seat and the the scores here are are literally just uh the difference on the Japan guess and I went too far east of turkey but left goes on um we need to talk about cheaters again you guys are weird you guys are weird bro there's Ziggy this dude Ziggy got better than me and went Sweden on Norway bro all right Blinky remember to repeat he went West uh why'd they go east and I'm assuming uh he knew the region okay I'm just trash I'm just garbage at Japan very standard day scores will probably fluctuate here I'm assuming some people beat me just because uh my bad turkey gas and you can probably just go downtown Tokyo and get a pretty good score so um let me know how you guys did on today's very small countries too Singapore um Netherlands repeat so um let me get let me go let me know how you guys did on today's good luck on tomorrow's and I'll see you tomorrow bye ", "locations":

right we're back and say 26 of a deal play alongside the link in the description you guys play that play next day we learn together we play together we guess Victoria together we get CD mix together we don't shoot together we learn together we round one Japan so there's this new medical around of how the guests in Japan right you have to like learn these plates right um I don't know what that means but I remember it's a little birdie told me rectangle play equals North Japan once I don't know if that's a rectangle plate or not looks like a rectangular place but um did I remember that right I don't know what I'm doing bro guessing in Japan we have low cam by the way low cam is Switzerland and Japan mainly you also maybe can see like Taiwan Sri Lanka but mainly in Japan I don't know bro I feel like I'm messing up this meta and I feel like this was like from like uh or was it like here like uh here up I'm gonna I'm gonna send it it kind of feels like Cinda anyways to me so hey if I'm wrong I'm just a loser okay but we're gonna send it and hope for the best okay not the worst points if you have 4.6 in Japan we'll take it round two we have just uh are you okay and it not sure what that was but we move on we've got the yellow back plates here with um very British um housing with the ugliest Skies a man could ever see equals um the UK and it looks very depressing and looks like you would never want to live there I'm just kidding um we're gonna go Oxford here it seems like it's a maybe I don't think it's too far north here maybe more south maybe even like Bristol we'll go Oxford I think that's safe because I think it could be like here it could be like here so I think it's in between let's find a little town that this could be in let's go uh it was just outskirts London we got 4.6 again round three is this yellow sticker Irish I think that yellow sticker means Irish I think it does I could be making that up we also have a White House White House always equals Ireland you're near The Vibes I guess it could technically be Northern Ireland but I'm gonna go Ireland here again we have a very depressing Sky uh but if it looks slightly less depressing uh it means you're gonna be in Ireland probably so we're going to start like right outside here I also I think this yeah I feel like Demetra told me that I don't know man um it doesn't look we can see a back plate there but we're gonna go Ireland it kind of feels like Ireland anyways and it was Northern Ireland was it possibility a game 4.6 again and this is gonna be a Sweden with the white Dash outer lines here uh with Jewel torp uh yellow signs are common in Sweden as well these white Dash outer lines are coming like Estonia Sweden um if you see red housing and we have a Swedish flag so everything here no shot I find Jewel top we're gonna try though we got 30 seconds on the clock like the Party Don't Stop that makes me so small I definitely feel like it's South just kind of off landscape I I can't be asked I can't be bothered guys I can't be bothered that's just so cringe game for a town like that we're gonna go like right here and hope for the best maybe a little more East I think I feel like right here it was just more North was juletorp even on the map I can't see it so that would have been cringed 4.5 and how we're gonna what the heck what is this obviously Europe guys I am so confused it's like Dutch no there's too many Hills is it Belgium I have no idea where this colossal like I literally have nothing here uh like at all to my name I go Belgium I have no idea what this could possibly be uh no it's not gonna be Belgium do what this is Sweden or something I'm switching Sweden dude why did I do that why they do that that's just nil that's just nail that's just l are we close from Belgium not sure why the last thing did that we'll get top 100 here and see what we got I'm gonna give myself a 4K score there because I I went Belgium okay I went Belgium I went Belgium I won Belgium um only three getting top 100. uh Blinky yeah everyone uh everyone oh we only have three verified again top 100 that's crazy um okay mainly because most people are cheaters but Belgium was close I I probably would have gone three like 38 3 900 points so not too bad I don't know why I switched the screen last second well I didn't think it was Belgium I knew it was in Belgium because this looks I don't know it's a very like when you get roads like this with like very very nondescript it's just impossible I mean nothing out the guard girls here are distinct you just have to go with Vibes um yeah just nil wait let me see what the sign is is that a low yellow sign um I think I saw a yellow sign yeah that was influencing my decision and in pz here you'd never go France that's crazy that's a really hard seed that's really hard round but we'll play to everyone that got that um probably get the highest score oh wow okay that validates me a lot man we were all over the place man we were confused bro we were confused I thought Baltic for a second my Belgium guess would have been decent guys my Belgium guess would have been DEC yeah I was confused uh Sweden doesn't make any sense like that's a bad guess just just a horrible guess um the the Latvia is a really good guess I think um check it makes sense 100 makes sense as well uh but I said I got first today not sure how dude if that I wonder if they can I'm gonna talk to Ziggy and let me know if that rectangle thing is did I get that wrong or not I probably did I'm probably just telling you guys lies but let's just say it's right um yeah everyone going Ireland there I'm kind of still liked by this dude this France round that's one of the most part I think one of the most difficult rounds I've had in a while um yeah very very interesting but we'll take it Belgium I'm gonna go ahead my first instance Belgium so we're gonna hang myself that okay okay okay okay okay any are you okay are you okay Annie let me know how you guys let me know how you guys did on today's good luck on tomorrow's and if you went to France on this comment a dub in the chat okay and I'll see you tomorrow bye

right so 25 daily series Arizona description you guys play today I play the next day you learn the other replay together we do a lot of things together we don't shoot together we we're we're going to read together today I'm gonna we're gonna read together today that's what we're gonna do we're gonna need a 24K score together today and um let's see we're gonna do We're Not Gonna We're not gonna go Colombia on Ecuador when we say it's gonna be Ecuador that's what we're not gonna do let's start let's see how I do today hope I don't have a link going on I don't we're gonna do Netherlands round one here we have yellow back plate and the yellow front plate um with some very very very Dutch brick and a Dutch language with the a bike icon and strut and dude um everything here screams Dutch so the question is where in Netherlands um impossible you click right here on the E in Netherlands and you get a very good score regardless see round two we have a Taiwan okay we're going for some good good scores today we're going for we're potentially looking at 24K you know maybe I was maybe I wasn't lying okay we're gonna do it um we got the Taiwan pole here if we get keeping small countries it's possible um so we have this black and uh I always say black and white but I'm talking about Taiwan poles and look back in the accordion like no it's black and yellow black and yellow black and yellow um sorry goes all the way down the bottom there we also have mountains to our uh North here which maybe makes me think we also have tons of like Palms good Lord makes you think we're gonna be like somewhat Southern like uh Southeast somewhere in this region where it's like pretty mountainous I feel like I've seen something like that in this region before um I know this road it wouldn't be this road maybe it's like near the city over here I don't know I feel like it's somewhere South with mountains to the north which is pretty much like all Taiwan we'll go like right here look right is your town here I don't know man I don't know we'll go here okay there's actually a little more south but picking up pretty good points uh that makes sense it was there um but we'll take that 4.9 next round we have an Australia with it looks like Victoria with his Pole or is this a road I've seen Tas made now I know this should be Vic I feel like I've seen similar um east-western Tasmania before um but this should be it looks like Vic to me I think that's a concrete pull do we have like the blue tick on the the usually on thick plates you see like a blue tick on the top I think um it feels very much like that reason with these trees and over how flat it is um and like The Greenery here makes me think maybe I mean it's pretty big Highway East to West we'll go assuming we're in vic here it's like not directly east west maybe we're like over here somewhere that makes sense sure with a bridge to our East why not um best guess I got hopefully it's a big hopefully it's near Melbourne it's a pretty big city um oh not too bad it was very far down Southwest but going Melbourne they're picking big points honestly we're on Pace for a pretty I think 24K I think 24K we have French Road lines here with water to the West so wait yeah French France um I thought we were driving left for a second it was very composed um so driving right we have these like Road lines like these outer Dash lines um these are where they're like spread like this and just kind of massive dashed are common in France don't get these confused with like Norway lines or they maybe look similar um but we have a very Sandy Shoreline to our West with water West in France so the question is I don't think it's gonna be this Coast I really don't this doesn't really look like anything like the green triangle anything in this is it like over here but like North maybe up here um is there like any beaches I don't really know the trash is outside dude I'm gonna go here could be um what is this sure not bad that's not bad at all the only reason I clicked there was because it looked like sand I was like oh that looks like sand uh sure um uh that's actually really funny but really good score um okay what do my Patron now is insane well even is this a Wonder oh it's Dunes okay sure I really don't deserve that guess and we have a chili can I have reason guys chill bait to get a 24K wait what do I need to get quick maths I need a pretty good score actually that's not gonna be possible I don't think that it's possible well actually it's a very deceivingly Big Country we have triple White Road lines with the Chilean pole here and a white Google car in the back here um white Google car is Chile uh Peru Perez black and white and Bolivia but with the triple White Road lines we're gonna be in Chile with his architecture as well and think of Chile as like a Minecraft biomes it's gonna be like desert grass snow and we're like in between like the snow and grass I feel like we're like we have like both desert and like grass so I'm gonna like some of the great Kirk maybe like it's suburb right here like I feel like it's near Santiago but not too South um I need a little more Southern Go San Clemente for 24K can I do it dude did no I don't think I did that's a 400 right there life goes on San Nicolas San Nicolas I did get it I mean to be fair that was a very easy see I feel like uh pretty standard like Vic a big Highway equals Melbourne was my thought process there uh I got I just got copped out by the Jersey guest they're the France guests with the water to the West with sand um there was even invisible but that was lucky I almost went here I was probably still really good if I went here or I was going up there um did that make sense yeah no big country so so pretty pretty standard see I'm assuming it's fairly well um let's load top 100 and see how I did foreign a bad day at all not a bad day at all so these are the top verified people in top 100 um oh dude my chili guess is horrible then I who was here with me is it Bucky oh look at bookie and he's the only one that beat me um everyone going Vic uh making sense there didn't get the road well stretcher and bokeh got the road right shout out to them for that I just kind of cowardly went downtown Melbourne um but you know worked out going getting the South Vibes there um lining up the mountain range of the North Fair me and Bokey had similar guesses again okay I'm who got this Pokey 5K this well um wait I'm gonna look at this again because that river right there I dude that's actually on the map that's actually really-fi cable if I like um you can see like the bridge wow well it wasn't Fun by bokeh in a minute that's insane well played um everyone getting the West Coast there um I almost went um here in France um so not bad there everyone yeah Pokey bro what are you on bro what is this what did this dude eat this morning bro what the what the hell what the hell boy you guys know that tick tock uh or that vine Maybe Chile I think that looked everything yeah honestly all in all a pretty standards day I get very lucky though with that France I think but overall we'll take that it was quite the Redemption art from yesterday's performance I think um where I embarrassed myself in front of 20 000 people because uh of a very blunder but what I did this morning was I woke up and I was like okay I I thought it was rent free my head all day yesterday I'm like I I'm not tomorrow I'm gonna make sure I have my caffeine in the morning I'm gonna play two games with you guys here before I play just to like you know into play prepare myself for clicking Maps you know as as one should and I really locked in today with something to prove with kind of just like a yeah wait on my back of just like something I need to get off so I'm glad I was able to bring it back we'll go back to the shitty guesses tomorrow but until then let me know how you've done the days and good luck on the Mars goodbye ", "locations":

going to be North Macedonia or wait am I tripping is it risk in the sky I thought this wasn't racing this guy let me down slowly we're gonna go on the North South Road oh dude yeah um yeah um so yeah we have usually the telephone North that's down it's kind of just like the real feel also you don't get a antenna on the back and honestly if you have this that's kind of helpful information um if I knew how to pinpoint better I would pinpoint this um but I I genuinely just don't I I really just don't it's been really great here we're gonna find something that lines up south of capital here and hope for the best it was just outside right outside there um that was a pretty one where reading maybe comes in handy but I can't believe didn't really felt like North Macedonia here we have uh we have a New Zealand little kiwi action uh we have this baller that goes red side to side when this red goes side to side it's a New Zealand baller if there's white on the edges it's going to be Australia um also like Poland also has like side to side red but uh they don't have like the yellow strip that goes down uh vertically first version you guys in here I feel like it's gonna be North Island um we have a sign here that says something Road um usually New Zealand has distinct science region of the world or each region of each City sometimes but I feel like it's gonna be somewhere maybe in this like Northern North Island region somewhere maybe a little more south actually somewhere uh yeah we'll go like right here it's actually just downtown Auckland so picking up 4.3 there nothing too crazy still a solid score here we just have Thai poles um and we also have Tai on camera on the stop sign here I'm driving left with Gen 4 camera it will be Thailand um we're in a pretty urban area we have some Palms there in the distance this will be somewhere probably near Bangkok here um nothing too crazy here nothing too crazy at all we have area codes or anything that I can't read um some ghosts maybe somewhere central-ish maybe near like a surrounding City um yeah we also have a Thai flag there that's helpful not Costa Rica um and this this light pole that goes out into the center is Thai um so yeah we'll go somewhere just outside uh maybe a little more North uh hedge maybe I don't think somebody Bangkok but somewhere near this I think region is fair it was South Peninsula you know I don't go there ever this is like Manitoba Sask um we have mountains though Asian truck route uh this is a can of specific sign with these like uh Checkers and we have Gen 2 camera which means we're gonna be uh Gen 2 isn't really found in the US with this like blur um where are these Hills like nmpz I always go Manitoba Sask here um I wonder where these Hills can be though because it's like pretty fairly flat you know pretty fairly flat I don't know what that sign means it's definitely gonna be somewhere in this region I think so I'm just gonna go here give me is it I'll burn it like over there somewhere we'll see yeah I was literally almost clicked that makes sense for those mountains um uh yeah I went in the most flat area ever so I was like very confused where those Hills could be um since it's that close to the Border though and Alberta left goes on here there's gonna be an Ecuador it looks like um so we have this uh antenna on the car where um it's like the single strip goes down this is Ecuador Bollard right here Ecuador is like 33 000 Bollard so don't get twisted but this is one of them that looks like turkey Ballard Australia Ballard um but yeah we have a long plate here after uses long and short plates as far as reason guessing I'm gonna go like somewhere in this region and maybe somewhere more southish like outside Bogota like right here I think it's it's fair wait what did I just do that might be the worst blunder I think I've ever done I have to I have to end the video there I've done the video there dude this is why you got what you gotta let your brain wake up before you play those games dude I what just happened bro I I can't look at other scores today guys I can't called Alberta and I called the I mean obviously I knew it was Ecuador I just sent Colombia dude all right um Good Luck on tomorrow's let me know how you doing todays and I'll see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 41.99300261898878, "lng":

right it's day 23 every day at the long series every single day the link in the description you guys play next get you guys play today play next day we learn together we play together we don't read together we go for tour together we get 20K score together readings cringe readings cheating uh going CD Max every single time it's Mexico is where they win um we uh make a guesses together I said that when they bag us together because that's what it's about and we also um we don't cheat together I think I might mention that um what else do we do um we start um I just lost a tournament um it's 3 10 p.m I'm late I'm sorry we don't post videos like together we um guess in this country right together and let me think where I am real quick where am I think the Philippines my best guess no I could severely mess up here my brain's fried from that tournament um just stirring for three hours of a pro tournament is going well I think this pavement screams Philly pavement to me maybe I go Manila here um sure makes sense looks like the car is on the right side uh it's my best guess uh I got if it's indo or Thailand or something I'll accept the L today I will heavily accept it I don't think we have polls or anything in the case to the entire thing so sure I and like I said open for the best it was just North Manila we'll take it and we move onwards into just a standard Yucatan here we have Alto in the stop sign um Alto is only found in Mexico and like uh maybe like I forget one of these countries on here I think it's Costa Rica and I don't even know maybe Guatemala I kind of for work it's definitely found in Mexico though but we also have these rock walls to our South these like rock walls right here very common in Yucatan so it should be a pretty standard uke I'm gonna go somewhere right here it was one more south but we'll take it round three we have still be poles look at this we're learning it today I call these Oreo poles these poles are called stoby's I think his name is James stoby that made these poles and they uh I think the lore behind them is that they ran out of material in South Australia and they had like they couldn't bring materials over or something like that so they had to make use the materials they had and so we had these stoby poles that only found in South Australia I hope I got that information right uh but they have like this like on the Outer Edge different color it looked like an Oreo right um so we're gonna be in like near Adelaide here and it was just downtown LA picking up five kilometers we'll take that and then we have a Dominican Republic we have Spanish with we have the black bar on the car here indicates Dominican Republic um we have painted bottom on the poles which means we're going to be the only two cities covered in Dominic Dominican Republic are Santo Domingo and Santiago de Luis Caballeros and one of these is um they paint the bottom a certain color I think it's sent to the mango but it could be North it was Santo Domingo picking up good points again do the seat what is a seed and then we have Guatemala we have this caramela without the black strip in the middle and Spanish so pretty standard sea today um you go Guatemala City here and pray for the best uh maybe a little more I like somewhere in this region actually and we guess and it was Guatemala City I should have stuck to my guns getting a 23.54 I'm assuming all the scores today were very high very very very very easy seed today and I did make it so we can filter verification now so let me load in all the verification do the top 100 and then I will sort my verification um happy to do everyone doing so much well like I said this is a very very easy seed a very meta-centric everyone getting Yucatan everyone getting Dominican Republic um everyone going Manila or uh Philippines um really at your score is depending on how North Philippines you went there because everyone is going to get Adelaide everyone's gonna get Dominican Republic right so you're there everyone's Gonna Get You Can tan everything's gonna go on my city so it really comes down to where did you go in the Philippines for your best score there and that's why I am like fifth um so very very easy to see to date with a lot of very very valuable information I feel like so we'll take it let me know how you do that on today's good luck on tomorrow's and remember cheating is cringe she cheating as cringe reading is cringe reading is cheating um always go for Toria always go see the mix and let's just do contain rocks um and good luck on

right we're back it's Dave our daily play along Series where every single day I put a link in the description you guys play the next day I play today we learn together we play together we don't cheat together we don't read together we always go Pretoria together we get 20K score together and let me make a guesses together and we make bad guesses together because that's what life's about right what in the Alaska is this why is this this is the most Alaskan coverage I think I I thought this is India for a second with this coverage what is this blur um you get this like blur in the last cake are we gonna scan for this um Mountain Lodge I mean what do I even scan for it I should read I said not reading together but I think that says Alaska on it I can't read that something Lodge I don't think it's gonna be like near Anchorage or anything like that um maybe more East talk tick tock tick tock on the clock like the party let's stop we have to go talk we have to go talk um I actually don't know where this would be is it ever like Fairbanks I don't even know Alaska covers that well um but sure we'll go here way more North by Fairbanks I had to do I did do Tick Tock for the for the for the memes though you know um we'll take that next round we have a hungry here we have the A-frame holy poles with Gen 4 coverage with this red strip down the Ballard there oh and we have some towns uh you're gonna make me scan today aren't we you're gonna make me scan we gotta find M5 the M5 six four three two one where's the five five how far is it go cusk something that's a long name because I can't even say that I don't know how far the five goes but roll I guess here it could be nowhere near here oh right here 13 North somewhere over here maybe oh there we go close enough readings cringe guys I'm sorry I I betrayed you I still didn't get a good score but I'm sure someone did we have low cam Japan here uh very commonly you get this little Canon like Switzerland Sri Lanka Taiwan Japan maybe for longer there's some controversy around the Sri Lanka is low camera not on the new Gen4 um but commonly in these uh Japan you get these like rock walls inside the road here and I don't know it feels like Japan so we're gonna go um it's never not Tokyo right I mean there's nothing really off here I might go a little more South I feel like this is a meme game so I might go Obama you know Tick Tock and Obama it might make sense um so Obama wasn't a bad guess we'll take that um and then round five here where we got oh round four sorry Russia I hope we have Russian Cyrillic there why does this feel like downtown Mongolia to me or like somewhere eastish this is a weird uh pull I feel like that's cool I should know that I might go like why was it husband's like cheetah somewhere over here if it was Eastern to me mountains Greenery I I this is a it could be a really risky guess though but I don't really know I mean do we find the river that lines up there's a river does it ever cross a bridge we're gonna be here how far did I just go I'm really far south now but hopefully it's not like super West oh it's actually not that bad of a guess oh that makes sense um that makes sense oh I got the general region right it was kind of near that Mongolia border there uh it was just south of the lake there in Siberia but we'll take that 3 800 not the worst we just have a downtown Columbia here remember the Colombian cross on the back of the signs maybe yellow Place yellow place in South America do equal Columbia some mountains so we're gonna probably be somewhat you know near the Andes here let's say like summer downtown and you're a little more southish we'll go like right here um this video dude it's like that what's that song um this just be I mean what's that song I don't know I'm gonna go like downtown um right here central hedge and it works it was actually Easter dandies 20.9 Kevin L um but not that bad score I've been getting Alaska's more North chasement Fairbanks but you know for the memes I went tick tock um and then Japan guys not bad when Obama got the right region of Russia I will take that hungry I decided to read that's kind of cringe and just went Central in Columbia so such is life I'm assuming my friends are better than I did uh oh I got third that's not bad probably the Russia that carried me um everyone going near Anchorage there only aiming going Fairbanks kind of cringe bro it's just downtown tick tock I have one Canada there everyone going to Japan um Giga Chad with the gigachad um I'm getting fourth there in Obama we'll take that getting the right version of Russia there being five King Matt well played Mr ning the three-time champ uh but you know all in all not that bad of a day I presume um you know some big countries yeah Alaska Alaska is fine I think that's her first Alaska in 80 to earned in this Challenge Series let's see how Pokey piver did link oh I mean I got top 50 today even though I got top 50. jhk and my king Top 36. This 36 is probably in real in like uh in all reality probably like 10th because like 26 people above me are cheating so we'll take that um uh let's get rid of something we already look at Charlie and Ing and Eamon goodbye sir see I'm Maxi waxy did we already looked at Max this is good enough um uh Pokey getting Fairbanks with who's that pepper nice well played sirs everyone getting uh the lake Vibes there there's better I'm just I'm just bad uh jhk didn't see her Tokyo hedge it's kind of smart um two going south look at dude how cute okay and paper are just holding hands you can totally play together can you and then everyone don't uh uh getting the right Road there um that's pretty cool boki is posting his version or his play along of this game on the patreon if you guys are interested in watching his gameplay um he is posting his play along with where he does well he got 24.4k so if you're interested in watching his play along there it's gonna be on the patreon um links in the description if not enjoy the free content here I guess but yeah great guess great thoughts there um overall I'm kind of happy with today I did uh do I mean 20K with Russian Alaska and Japan not bad we'll take it let me know how you doing today's let me know where you messed up let me know why you messed up and um Good Luck on tomorrows but ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 65.04690414009801, "lng": -147.4347018097587}, {"round": 2, "lat": 46.760294913167805, "lng": 19.59584226623929}, {"round": 3, "lat": 34.01489139093102, "lng": 134.4267682122058}, {"round": 4, "lat": 51.550214107378615, "lng": 105.0940387214173}, {"round": 5, "lat": 5.261763364527094, "lng": -72.48110415987946}], "images_path": "data/iamges_rainbolttwo_1/7pXBCGNxJRcEOJdw"}

right it is eight Twenty One our daily playlist every single day I put a link in the description you guys play today I play the next day and then we learn together we play together we don't cheat together we don't read together and make a guesses together shall we I've heard some news that this is a hard sea today so I'm currently playing on blink mode no we do not want that I do not want to play in 0.1 seconds it look like South Africa Mexico or something it was South Africa okay maybe I should start playing on them maybe I should start planning on 0.1 seconds I think I've done better um okay so let's see if we can see we're driving left here at the Gen 2 camera Gen 2 camera is only in and southern Africa is only in South Africa here um I'm just assuming it's gonna be Pretoria because it's never not Pretoria I mean this could be uh more like Johannesburg with a low-key because it doesn't really feel I have to I have to go with my guns though dude let's go with my guns it's probably Joe Berg maybe not it's definitely somewhere in this region though maybe I go here because it doesn't feel like as Urban um I hope some of you guys went I'm hoping this is here um okay it was more North it's still not never not Pretoria okay trust um picking 4K points I'm assuming most people's guesses will be uh oh what is this this is not easy at all okay show me South America instant instant thought was Columbia or Ecuador here um I like South Dakota I think there's no antenna which is Health nothing is helpful there um I do think something when the two of these Hills though this is not an easy round I'm just kind of looking for anything I can grasp onto here I just have to go off of immediate Vibes here and I think this is just gonna be Colo like Southern Polo or something like that I and I feel like the fences maybe indicate that to me more than anything but like I said this could not be any are we driving left presumably not um best guess I got okay what was Southern color next round oh dude they're really testing us out here now we got a Russia arusca um I mean how far east I want to go as a question here it's not going to be that North because of the trees don't feel very Northern to me it feels kind of Western I think I'm gonna do the chill events or like oofa like I I can't reason against Russia at all guys I'm really sorry I'm just I'm just not very good I can get like three regions maybe four or five regions in Russia and um this isn't one of them I'm trying to think of where this it feels maybe more like I said I think this is a safe maybe more eastern-ish like alms or something we'll see it could be very very far east could be very far west okay it was kind more north um in vizinga honestly not that bad I guess for Russia but like still not that good my oofa gas or shelving these guys have probably been better but um nonetheless for Russia we'll take that candidly we have a Portugal here we have of Portuguese pole um with um this like ladder pole with the holes in them and we have these Portugues or roofs where it's like very distinct and like uh that color and molding um I'm gonna go somewhat Eastern uh Portuguese here uh Portugal here and like maybe near this like region um so yeah we'll see what we got we got palm trees doesn't really mean much let's not go to National Park let's just pick this neighborhood right here and it was super fast self losing so many points we have a grease I think foreign this is Italy not Greece I thought I saw Gen 2 immediately thought yeah this should be Italy here so Italy we have this pole I I don't know I can't explain it but this looks like an Italian Pole where it's like oh um we also have black on the back of the sign here which is indicator for early Albania Romania when you're in um Italy or when you're in Europe and it looks like we have a blue strip right here and a blue strip right there which would indicate that it's a double blue strip and this language right here is not Greek so I was like wait um so we're gonna get a pretty crappy score I think today um I would be very gracious if I could get 4.2 here and break 20K border 20K barrier here um so I'm gonna play it somewhat safe and go like right pretty big mountains there though dude oh dude I think it's gonna be someone North let me look right here we didn't break 20K for the second day in a row um Kevin Noah I didn't really have any really good guesses today I don't think collo kind of a good guess but also kind of easy I just put Victoria there and kind of like bad portal version guess I actually spent Central Italy such as life um I'm assuming there's a really um yeah only four people completed uh I'm getting Southern Colo there so that is good everyone Victoria it's never not Victoria I'm glad they listened everyone in south Portugal and everyone went to Central Italy there and shout out to traboda for getting the town right in Russia what a giga Chad um who we got a bangle okay bangle I see you [Music] Southern Colo easy peasy lemon squeezy um a little sudden early guest there uh it's a bunch of Pretoria hedgers to do or I lose my points I've lost my points on La and Russia um honestly not the Harvest seed but it's just it's just like a scene where you're not going to get like um you know any 5Ks or anything like that like nothing there was pretty pinpointful at all maybe the Italy maybe no I mean maybe the early one was probably the most pinpointable one um but uh yeah pretty that was difficult but there was a couple of rounds in there where if you haven't played the game for a while um I don't think you would ever call it Southern color there or anything like that so um let me know how to do that on the days good luck on tomorrow's and always remember reading is cringe ",

right we're back it's day 20 of our daily planning series for every single day i put a link in the description you guys play today i play the next day and we play together we learn together we don't cheat together and we don't read together because repeat after me reading is cringe i'm just kidding i'm going to make sure this is my challenge i'm going to read every single sign i can okay game one of the day we're in ireland okay we got the double yellow airlines here these double dl airlines are found in uk ireland hong kong malta singapore um kind of that journal uh vibe there there are those countries there i make sure i'm reading signs okay i mean yeah i mean that means nothing to me it's probably irish uh we're driving left uh uk has yellow back plates ireland has white back plates we do have water to the east here which is quite interesting in an ireland scenario like is that like the coast is that like something um like this i mean that's kind of a risky guess i'll be up there maybe something like that it looks like a little enclave to the east i don't know what makes sense here i mean i guess that makes sense sure well we'll get somewhere like central okay it here a little more north and it was that town up there with water to the east okay andy are you okay are you okay we have brazil here with um some ladder poles uh long plates brazil commonly uses long plates only um we have the salary dishes i i feel very common in brazil's wear as well um we're guessing here i like north i do like north here it feels like kind of like that northern vibe like somewhere maybe near like uh baya or something like that um do we have any area codes i make sure i i'm i say i was gonna read i'm not reading still what am i doing oh it says brazil right there that's helpful as well but readings cringe i'm not just kidding i can't read any error codes um but do you think i'm going to go somewhere northeast here um let's just call it let's just find some of a decent-sized city dude two countries brazil canada getting out of here remove them i'm just kidding so here we have italy with a short yellow or short double blue strip front plate here um also you get the tumbler aesthetic in italy with the lower case and all their signs um and we do have mountains sort of northeast here so presumably we're gonna be somewhere in north italy maybe near the mountains in the north of the italy's um do i read i should probably read usually in italy you get like on parking signs um there's um town names that i don't know if it would help me because i don't really know my town name is nearly that well i'm gonna presume we're somewhere north maybe near uh this region we'll be in bolson how about that okay we weren't in bolson so far two of the three countries have had a flag and the rising of the country so hopefully you guys are so far three for three this is what we like to call a standard pretoria okay this is never not pretoria and i'm going to show you why let me let me just click ratori first i really hope this is for tour now i'm driving left we have the fences um yeah these these fences in south africa are super common you see a bunch of gated fences we also have a yellow outer line here um if anyone here went like australia because maybe they saw the southern hemisphere driving left australia doesn't use yellow outer lines unless it's like a national park or like somewhere really snowy where they use yellow for it to be distinguishable but this is a free pretoria don't ask we have mexico here i presume we are going to be in mexico i hope at least okay he's looking looks like something mexico i guess it could be like ecuador or something no i'm thinking about it but i like mexico here short plates mountains we got coca-cola that's the most mexico thing ever if you see coke ads or a coke truck or something we also look at this sun sun actually indicates from the southern hemisphere but that's a lie i hope i don't think this is ever equal yeah i don't think so um so i think the student has here i'm gonna go a little bit west of cdmx here and hope for the best it was just more south not even breaking 20k because brazil is stupid thank god dude dragon dogs you absolutely based human being um how did i beat your body when he did that well on brazil i only gave 100 points but that's that's interesting uh oh there's a victoria it's never not pretoria it's never not pretoria guys it's never not victoria um that's just a i i don't like brazil i just don't let's go to my actual friends here um oh my god guys there's no way you guys see what i see we only have one cheater today we only have one shooter today let's go this is progress this is absolute progress and wow look at his name yeah that's so true wow um let's see how let's say we did bokey is verified finally got the man verified so we can uh we can all rejoice together um yeah this is a pretty standard suit here um basically what this comes down to if you want to be like a top 20 top 30 scores today you had to have gotten kind of the central region brazil there um uh like they they you know got goyas and and such um yeah he's free pretoria joe burke too kind of not a sarah joker it's always pretoria um blinky getting that let me go back and see if i missed anything brazil no i guess you know what it feels like if i can find the video i'm gonna put that on the screen right now because i feel like it reminds me of this exact town i don't know where that town is but if it's near this town this would make sense i'll put i'll put on the screen i'll put on the screen if to show them i i don't know if it's gonna be near there but if it is near there then i will never get this town wrong again because it feels like this exact region and i think if i got that right if i remember that video it would it would make sense um well great guess is going south there too i think that's a guess i went kind of western there because it felt like green in the mountains uh of the west but the mountains south is seen next to i guess these hills make sense there as well um let's see if there's anything else maybe i could miss her probably but i'm not smart

how you did on today's good luck on tomorrow's and let's go for being reformed and being on real people and not cheating and learning together and hopefully not reading together either see you

right we're back it's day 19 of our daily playlist series for every single day i put a link in the description you guys play the next day i you guys play today i play the next day and then we learn together and then we play together shall we and most importantly we don't cheat together because cheating is cringe and we're not cringe round one looks like we have some bollards here that look to indicate the bollards of the danish um unless i'm confusing dude this always happens to me but i always confuse excuse me uh denmark bollards with belgium's um but this should just be uh the marks so um yep just kind of checking around like region guessing here um yeah i know it feels like very like maybe north ish denmark we'll say so we'll go like right here nice 48 we'll take that i'm going for at least hop through my friends list today okay um that was just a baller guess by the way the yellow tip and the bollard belgium has similar ones do not get it twisted round two um it looks like we have a spain here um we have this like antenna long antenna i don't know where i think i've seen this in spain before um i think that's a spanish song i'm just kind of making things up as i see him to be honest uh we have spanish there maybe it's portuguese i do not know but this was like way more uh spain so should be pretty standard here uh you can look and see that sun the south means we're in the northern hemisphere with uh spanish means you know that leaves us with like four countries um as far as region guessing i like somewhere like south of madrid maybe like over here um kind of dry um i feel like this means something too um let's just say if you see this you're gonna be in spain okay um but yeah uh just kind of overall just like these like trees sparse in without uh the country feels very spain to me um so we'll go like right here and it was a little more southwest but we're getting the right country there so we'll take it next round here looks like it's going to be the almighty canadians but don't fret because i am okay with canada if we have signs so immediately here we have french on the side it looks like maybe it looks like it might say roux d roo is french um which means you know if you're going to be in the canadians you're going to be in uh quebec um we also have this maximum sign here um if it has a black strip at the bottom you are going to be in ontario uh this does not have a black strip so that rules out ontario um but also with the french that's kind of helpful assuming that is french um i'm gonna go ahead and go under the assumption that it is um so we'll go somewhere like maybe over here uh maybe more a little more real more north ish this is pretty central heading in quebec and it was a little more southwest but picking up some big points there 4.6 not too shabby it was french on that sign that i did notice um and it looks like we might have some um swedish here with the red roads uh gotham got him um i know there's like the um yeah i'm kind of thinking we have the that as well i'm sure what meta was it that has um was it all in that has a red roads meta isn't this like yeah obviously then that wouldn't make sense though what it okay i'm kind of trash when it comes to sweden i think i'm gonna think i'm gonna take the race into island um i don't even know what that i don't know it looks like over here to be honest but i know there's red roads somewhere over there so i'm gonna try it i think yeah i mean that was finland too so i'm not sure why i guess there but life goes on we have the black car in nigeria here um i do not know nigerian cars candidly um why did i guess i went there i don't know life goes on um i do think this is not i know in nigeria like a gray car i do know that i don't know if you also get black car um we have the white blur uh in nigeria you also get these lighter poles and if you see a bunch of very big houses you're probably gonna be in nigeria also the follow cars are pretty distinct each city so you can probably learn them we have palms there north there makes you think we're gonna be like maybe somewhere more southernish near the coast so i'll go banan city um i feel like this soil clear can make sense for bernan we'll see and it was been in city nice ending on the high note there really the only blunder was getting um guessing finland on sweden when i said it was swedish um i think that was just because the red road i think you get red roads in island maybe with scotland you get railroads someone let me know um but in general i think that's a pretty solid score going five or five in countries region guessing within the countries is pretty good i got a density there so um we'll see how i did against the homies i said in the beginning i want to get at least third so um did not happen but i'm assuming we have more friends going north there yeah again it's a very very easy sea it's a very standard sea where there's no real hard rounds so you'll all see very similar scores like the difference between let's say blinky um i'll put the first legit player on this list is probably ice god so getting a 24k so um the difference between 24k and 23a you know my 23k is very very minimal let's see how let's see how [Music] these people did why did i go island on that um everyone getting north of sweden there uh everyone getting denmark everyone getting queue back with the french everyone getting spain and everyone getting banana city i lost my points on sweden today um because i overthought it can i click this lock hello um yeah i mean obviously this looks northern sweden um and honestly it looks something like island at all yeah spain everyone kind of going the central region there uh yep again a very standard seed nothing too crazy let me know how you did on today's and good luck on tomorrow's bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 56.42076091216391, "lng": 10.102603519277464}, {"round": 2, "lat": 38.013294242525845, "lng":

right it's day 18 of our daily play along series for every single day I put a link in the description you play the next day I play the day after and we learn together we play together and we have fun together no guess shaming no bad guesses we all make bad guesses as I'm about to do right here right now round one Let's see we got here we got blue strip in that plate and they only thought we're gonna be simmering like excuse me Russia or something we do have some languages here looks like a very Polish language if I do say so myself um I see a y and a w and I immediately just think Poland as one should um and yeah I mean with jazzo though this is the most Polish language ever if you see a bunch of wise J's and Z's W's you're more than likely going to be in Poland also sick ride dude um we can also probably um sorry my AC turned on that's kind of known for the audio but we move on looks like we might just have a PL there as well on the license plate on blurred there um as far as reason you guys think I don't know you can't really see anything it's pretty Urban um but we're gonna go like somewhere over here I think it's a safe guess mainly because it's Central it was Western so we'll take that round two here it looks like we're going to be in like Thailand here we have a type hole one these like holes going down the side you see these in Thai um Gen 4 camera is also only in Thailand when you're in kind of like in between Cambodia Laos and Thai Thailand also drives the left we can't really see what side of the road we're driving on here but this like pavement that's like overall like this concrete road is very very common in Thai as well um so um is that Mountains for West no that's just clouds so we're gonna go somewhere maybe like just north of Bangkok here probably I don't think it's Peninsula um don't think it's too far east I think this is a safe Edge maybe somewhere over here um and it was indeed Too Far East uh the life goes on and on and on you're gonna be in Cambodia if we look at the antenna on the car here we have one two three swivels down to the side of the antenna this is a Cambodian thing um you get the short stubby antenna in like Mexico Ecuador Colombia and Brazil but there's only one swivel so that's a good thing to tell we also have Cambodian um um polls um so that's helpful but overall we're driving right we can tell because of the way the signs are facing here and like I just mentioned Thailand drive to the left Laos also drives right um but just overall the journal field here is going to be uh Cambodia and usually you get in Cambodia you get a bunch of houses on stilt so I'm gonna go somewhere over here where I think it's maybe more green so maybe it could be more East we'll see yeah it was more East um then we have a curse in this is a very fun seat so far we got here um mountains to our North there um then we have the north car with the mirror um usually in Kyrgyzstan you get this you know you get the mirrors the roof rack and you also get blue strips on or yellow strip good Lord you get red strips on license plates and kerg um I'm gonna go somewhere maybe in this journal region over here actually I'm gonna go more East we'll cut like right here sure dude if I mix up the North and South car well I blame the wired video I blame the wired video dude they put the visual wrong in the wired video and ever since then I uh I uh I've gotten the wrong region of the Kirk because I keep thinking the mirrors are the reflection mirrors is different um this should be a Uruguay here I think we have black car this is Uruguay um Uruguay Argentina in Peru um but with overcast coverage like this I lean more towards Uruguay um I'm trying to see if we can have like oh we have a black dot on this license plate and I think we might have one here as well uh black dots and license plates do equal Argentina so maybe we are like somewhat near the orange Uruguay border so I'll go like right here and there's a little more West but honestly a pretty bad score I got all the countries right but like horrible reason within the countries um but such is life um for five very easy countries there's another one of those seeds where everyone's gonna get the country's right it's just a matter of like somewhat decent region guessing within the countries um these aren't my friends everyone getting tired of getting Cambo G everyone getting Argentina everyone getting Poland look at us just out here stacking up um yeah like I said this is just all the difference between first place and eighth place is um well I'm assuming the Kirk yeah I missed the South Kirk car that's really the only blunder I had I think everything else is kind of pretty um pretty average I think guessing let's see how Blinky did jhk um get one more in there Max yeah we're gonna do the Max uh let's see if Lincoln jhk did today is bulky in here I need to find Pokey bro you get this man verified all right yeah I'm assuming I'll get the South car yeah I blundered that um shk going south or east High um and they're pinpointing the region of Cambo there I think that green is like very common over there as well um Arch guesses all pretty standard yeah this is a very standard seat nothing too crazy um nothing too crazy at all um very very similar day let me know how you did on today's and good luck on tomorrow's but more importantly let me know how you doing todays and I'll see you tomorrow goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 51.20916925643131, "lng": 16.14998296126768}, {"round": 2, "lat": 16.04082782413217,

right it's day 17 of our daily pillow long series for every single day I'll put a link in the description you guys played deadhead me I play next day and we learn together and play together shall we yesterday I forgore how I did I think I did pretty decent um oh I missed Canada oh yeah I missed Canada and I said you guys know history with Canada and then an hour later I played in a tournament and lost on Canada so if there's a Canada in here I'm uh I'm stopping the video let's just start and see how we do um round one here it looks like we're gonna be in Brazil we have the Brazilian ladder polls right here um first game of the day as well so bear with you it's taking a second to um get my Pro my thought process going I thought this was a Sri Lankan car for a second and I was very confused um no but we do have the Brazilian ladder poles right here um it is very interesting Brazil um because it's slightly green like kind of Rolling Hills green which made me think maybe more this region Maybe mgds probably not I do like somewhere over here maybe more south maybe near Sao Paulo where you kind of get this like green ish areas um I go slightly more North though I think maybe somewhere over here safe doesn't feel like too South kind of does actually kind of does I think this is a safe head Shimmer in South Hollow or piranha um we'll see and we have gin one what is this gin one bro it's like wah it was a seed um yeah so this is gym one Australia like what is this bro um we have Australian dollar from 2014 2004. um Australian signs I mean it's like very Western they're like very it feels like very Western soil here this might be the worst score I possibly get in the daily challenge because if I go Western Australia here and it's like Vic or South Australia I'm gonna have like 3 000 points going into round three um so this could be a bad look for your boy I'm gonna send it I'm gonna I'm gonna send Western Australia man all right we're gonna pick it up we're gonna be in North Mexico here um we got the short plates here um Gen 4 with Spanish um genuine is banned from competitions and such for that exact reason reason by the way um we did mountains for West here um yeah I know like I say I always just go see the max guys if if I go north and south I'm literally knocking I'm not I'm gonna be a 10K Andy I can't be I can't be thinking Andy I have to at least I have to at least get some points here so I'm just hoping this is outside the cdmax got the short plates um Gen4 uh you can see the sun's probably in the South too he has Northern Hemisphere so okay it was North and then we have I think God we have a Taiwan so it's just free 4 900 points um with the black and white stripes all the way down the bottom um driving right sure version guessing it's like very mountainous East more cities and whatnot West so I'll go somewhere like over here just guarantee me some points you can be like a four seven yes thank you thank you that's all I asked for and then we have a Malta thank God I can finally end on a very high score um Kappa um so we have the classic Malta rock walls here um so um you get these like rock walls like very very commonly and Malta you also see them kind of in like maybe Bari Italy maybe sometimes Spain something like that but very very common in Italy or Malta um so just give me my points let me get out of this Lobby honestly um I think there's a very important quote for for today though and I think that quotes uh it's not about how you start it's about how you finish um not really I mean only really only real bad guess I think was the Brazil guests were kind of blundered like you you want me to guess where this is bro this this looks exactly like Western Australia like what do you want from me um let me see if there's any new coverage that looks any oh that doesn't look anything like where I guessed why did the soil change every single color in the past two years this is nsw wait what that was like Vic where are we that's crazy oh that's over there nah and let me look at the Brazil again real quick I don't even want to look at my friends yeses because I just know it's going to be bad I don't think this is north I don't ever go north here in my opinion I'm I'm assuming people but people better at Brazil did go north here so um just ratio me all my friends please yeah okay okay like two two people went like not even that North there um and the only reason I really lost was because I went Perth this is a safe guess but no shot you guys cannot tell me to look like anything like nsw these people are cowards for guessing SW and I will stand on that I will stand on that um Kappa yeah just Taiwan Malta very very easy seed outside the one blunder there Life Goes On life goes on and on and on life goes on and on and on I put my hands up in the air sometimes uh how did Maxi waxy cap um all right let's talk I think this is not the way to do this but if you're kidding in the daily challenges just trying to have some fun guys I just wanna I just wanna we're supposed to be learning together I don't know me talking about it is is only inciting it more but you guys don't want if you actually want to get better like trying to look cool in front of a video is like it's a very very strange Behavior but I respect that I guess I respect it I respect it not really but I'm not gonna act like I'm molding over it because I really it doesn't really matter but I'm coping right now because of this also I'm gonna be honest part of me thought this was um this right here was black on the bottom of their Bollard which I think in my head you get black bottom bollards in Western Australia by the way so I think Harvey thought that right there I'm pulling out the screens if you can see it but this right here this black on the bottom here was a was a Western Australia Bollard but just an L all around this is the avails it's the Devils but um yeah what are you gonna do about it tomorrow I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna do even better I got all the countries right I did get all the countries right so I'm on like a 20 country streak if we're counting the days John just together so we'll take it okay we'll take it um I'm also I'm still rambling but I think this is one of those seeds where I think I get a better score if I do this 0.1 seconds than I do if I do it in 30 seconds it's just one of those one of those rounds I think where um I don't ever say I don't ever instant sin while there I don't think I probably safe hedge Vic and I probably used to instance in like middle of Brazil in both instances I probably got a better score um but at the end of the day that's life and if you get every guess right all the time then this game would be very boring so um let me know how you doing today is I'm assuming you did better than me if not L if so w and good luck on to Mars and I'm sorry this video was late but I'll see you tomorrow morning bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

right it's day 16 of our daily playlist series for every single day i put a link in the description you guys play a challenge link ahead a day ahead i play next day we win the other replay together and i make bad guesses right now right here let's do it round one is going to be pretty interesting uh i mean it should be austria we have gen 4 um with some german so we have polaris wolf is that a german accent we have a tesla whoo heron burger hasselbacher um so yeah so we're in austria with the gen fourth german germany doesn't have gen 4 just like 2011 coverage uh switzerland is low cam so as far as region guessing it feels like it could be like this region right here or like somewhere north over here or even more west i'm gonna go somewhere over here i think pretty risky but let's try it okay that makes sense yeah anywhere really really that's not the huge mountains so 4.6 not the not the worst guys not the best okay round two why is he why i mean that's a french baller surely but why is why is bro like that um so yeah we have the french baller here assuming it's it's just the king of bollards i guess just on the post like that it feels like this region of france to me down here by the green triangle i don't know it just does i'm gonna go there um i don't know how to put it could literally not be anywhere near here but um these trees in this landscape if we're going to be in france it feels like this uh uh landscape somewhere over here near this region wow yeah we'll take that next round here we have uh some swedish um this winter coverage in sweden um sorry i'm just looking around here is there for norway no this is gayten yeah uh i know that there's more winter coverage north i feel like somewhere over here i think that's a bad guess though i think i have to go somewhere north like over here somewhere like i'll go just north of stockholm like right here i think um i probably should read it again i told you guys i was gonna read today i didn't read today i'm sorry it was south near shako um we got here we got here we have a long plate right here we have an ecuador uh taxi i don't think this is real but i think more commonly you get yellow taxis in ecuador also ecuador commonly has these orange back plates and you get both uh short plates and long plates in ecuador so you can tell that this short player here is short you can tell this plate right here short and this is a long plate right here so that's all big signs for equal i mean we have taxis so we should be somewhat of a decently sized city it could just be quito but i'm gonna go right here and hope for the best that was so north holy tool can um i mean we're in the right country but yeah that was uh i'm assuming we've got capital we're going to get good guesses there is this going to be canada probably well yes this is going to be somewhere in canada we have white our lines we have this like car glitch that i think is more common in canada over the us where you get this like white visible um and we all know my history of canadians so this will be interesting i mean i want to go somewhere over here like quebec um i hate this man i hate this what am i looking at here like what can i there's excuse me there's no real information so this is where i'm gonna find a bridge and hope for the best help my friends do get maxing the bridge there it did feel north i would have never gotten that north personally shout out to my boy uh ning with me in quebec we got a newfound guest here with uh salvador um irving sweden it's definitely more common north like cab everyone getting the green triangle there austria yeah pretty standard received i messed up on uh canada but such as life such as life it's just canada's just it's just it's just not who i want to be what happened here oh heck um overall not the worst not the worst i mean i i went five or five on country so you can't really complain um also can this guy with my profile picture stop cheating please you're weird pivot and see how jhk did have some respect my man what else we got i got there let's see ljk who is this jhk in here i forgot um getting alberta there sask me and jhk just out here holding hands green triangle moment and uh me just give me some pretty similar guesses but he just alphabet me on canada wait where do you go in ecuador yeah he's some capital i probably shouldn't want that not the worst score um i got almost 20k with you know some somewhat i mean this was just a bad guess but i mean i'll work my camera in the future don't worry guys don't worry um and this was a good this was a good seed for people that don't want to read signs i feel like you know almost i feel like some of it was like kind of a good seed for um what up i'm jeremy 19 i never [ __ ] learned

right we're on day 15 of our daily filling series for every single day i put a link in the description you play day hit me i play next day and we learn together we play together and make a guesses together shall we um yesterday did produce it didn't really have any really big blunders um today i'm expecting at least a 24.9 k or i'm trash so let's see first thing today as always no move round one driving left looks like we're gonna be in the the british in it i don't know man um we have yellow backplates here which indicate we're going to be in the uk and not um ireland so that's helpful as far as where in this country i think i call it the priest safe you have like somewhat of landscape in their east it might be helpful not to me though um i think somewhere around here is safe i don't think it's too welsh or anything like that um it could be like a small country we'll get like at least four and a half k points probably going center anyways so um but yeah you can tell we're driving left because of uh how this road is laid out and you can see the car driving left up there and the yellow back plates is in the uk well guess here it was very south and we got 4.3k not the worst we have the leaf meta this is the a2 or the 66 it goes into the 66. um so this leaf is only found on this road and nt and it goes into queensland like somewhere over here um we have a curve to our east that goes like that maybe does that line up i don't know it's gonna be somewhere on the 66 it could be in queensland like somewhere over here but and we have a there's a it's to our south there's a junction as well we like here is that that road right there maybe best guess i got let's try it no it was super far west and there that's uh yeah that's super five cable uh if i scanned if i had longer than a minute i could line it up but um yep so that road right there in nt is the only road that has a leaf on the camera it goes into queensland as well i think i'm not sure how far i think to like right here somewhere but that's a good way to tell where you are on that road is the leaf we have a little malay action um my instant recognition was gonna be like saba region um so we're driving left we have malay signs right here at the green and black and white um stripe poles here are malay it's not gen 4 so we could be in mainland or we could be on borneo uh right now i'm looking for like stickers on poles that maybe indicate uh usually mainland you get black stickers and on borneo island malaysia which is this northern part of borneo is you get white stickers um but i think we're gonna be near saba somewhere just because of this mountain to our west here it feels more like this northern it could it could easily be mainland but i could lose a lot of points here but on borneo if you have these like hills i'm more inclined to go near sabah region so i'll go um somewhere over here uh sure okay it was near saba so we're just more south there being a 4.7 not the worst not the best and we have a fun sea don't we we have a little meta action here um with guatemala with the car here um with spanish um dominican republic you get like the black strips filled in on the side here so you're never like me in dominican republic also i wonder if this means anything i feel like this like this like a bead going out with a stick is like maybe something specific in a certain region of guatemala but honestly it's like a pretty urban city like it's just safe for me to go guatemala city here just trying to get the most points man it's probably not going to be guamana city but if area codes uh santa fe like yeah like i'll go like a slightly more south gauntlet city um but should be enough points regardless it was more west um game 4.6 so for a pretty standard seed and then we're ending off with a pretty good pretty good score here because we're gonna be in south korea uh with korean blue signs and korean language here i mean do we try this game for 264 268 maybe that seems like pretty small uh they're a doc seal probably not i'm gonna go here get the best score we can and we'll take it 22.7 not actually the best score the uk kind of fumbled there good guesses um elsewhere though let's see how the homies did there let's see how we did everything pretty good scores i wonder if anyone's found um yeah such a brother or salvador found the 5k there all this guessing on the the a2 there um most of us getting saba sk right region i'm going furthest north and the uk there and then we're going to go and see so overall pretty pretty standard seed there most of the points probably came from where they lose mostly points i didn't really lose very many points anywhere besides maybe round one in the uk that's probably my biggest hit up there but um overall nothing too crazy um very very standard seed um so we'll see how everyone did here doo doo doo we'll call it there shall we caught there everyone getting the a2 very very standard road everyone getting saba running sk i probably just game for that kind of boring though and everyone getting england or britain and oh did i miss something here you know it probably is it probably why read why why would you read that's so fun very very standard uh for for myself but uh we'll take it we'll take it we're still getting some of a solid score tomorrow i promise i'll read signs um maybe maybe not uh probably not but um yeah let me know how you do on today's challenge i'll put tomorrow's in the description and best of luck on tomorrow's and let me know how you doing today's and i'll see you tomorrow bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 51.05251698182411, "lng": 0.1666648295971477}, {"round": 2, "lat": -19.40547153491947, "lng": 134.4718534647126}, {"round": 3, "lat":

right so 14 of our daily playlist or every single day I'll put a link in the description you guys played ahead me I played next day and we learn together we play together and we make good guesses together shall we um day 13 yesterday play the little Checker I messed up the audio but today I am recording audio and we're gonna we're gonna run it back yesterday at 23.2 pretty standard seed Mr 5K I'm hoping for good things today we can keep the the streak continuing round one we're gonna be in Darwin um immediately here we have like it's gonna be Australia but just generally to fill this with these palm trees is like very Northern Australia um yeah it's just kind of a Vibe thing I feel like I feel like also like the way that this road is like um it just feels like a Darwin Road just the way it's like orange scented I'm not sure um but yeah definitely gonna be in Darwin I feel like it could be Queensland but I'm pretty sure it's just Darwin here um very commonly in like um I think that it's a red plate I think you get red plates in Darwin but very commonly you get these palm trees and like NT up here in Darwin and then kind of the Queensland Coast so um I'll try to make sure we could see any um NT also uses like metal holy poles but um makes sense there it was not Darwin but it was NT in the national park there I didn't even know there were houses over here to be honest with this house is in this National Park that's crazy I did not I did not know there's a neighborhood there imagine living there that's crazy round two is a prisoner in South Korea we have the um black and white black and yellow stripe pole that goes um not only down the bottom we also have the yellow uh single yellow Airline here with uh South Korean baller with the yellow circle right there uh winter coverage black car driving right um I mean South Korea literally looks the exact same everywhere so the maximize points you click dejon and hope for the best um yeah I don't know anything about South Korea besides uh seoul's area code so this is the best I got right here um it was just Northeast but still picking up 4.5 because it's a small country we have polish bollards right here with the um the red tint or like the red side to side um the red going into end with the white on top white on bottom usually Poland ooh can we scan for I mean that's gonna be so small um deserine stops pedestrian signs of Poland as well have the usually most signs have zebras where it's like one two three four five zeros where you have like the solid lines uh pollens are distinct some other countries have this well but also it's a good in here for Poland is they just have that line behind the man walking so that's a good sign as well um as well as a font and green sign here I might go somewhat South this year I think I'm being so much Southern Vibes it is pretty flat it's not gonna go too South but I think somewhere near like let's go kills is is safe um you also get these very commonly pulling these like crosses on the side of the street um bogus here not a bad guess it was kind of in the general region there picking up 4.7 next round here around four or five let's see what we got um difficult around I hate Urban um Europe I think we're going to be in Denmark or Belgium we have B type guardrails I forgot would be type guard girls are I know B type are in Poland so basically where you get this like thin I think the double white here makes me think we're gonna be in Denmark more than Belgium especially this architecture not too sure can we go somewhere um right here outside herning maybe I think this should be right I can't really see it that doesn't look like a yellow or a red tint plate and overall this like architecture in the distance to herself looks Danish so it could be wrong but the best guess I got it was just Southern Denmark there so in the right country there um I know the b-tech gargles are also in Poland I guess you get them in Denmark as well I didn't know that where uh the thin strip in the middle is also pretty common and then final round here is just going to be a very standard Netherlands so we're gonna get a pretty good score today um we have the yellow back plates with the yellow front plates very standard vague um or I I probably pronounced that wrong vague you can roast me in the comments um but yeah for the yellow front place your back plates is only in like um Netherlands and Lux in Europe so that's helpful um but yeah this is gonna be another ones with like this architecture and language and as far as region guessing in uh Netherlands is near impossible in my opinion so we go there and hope for the best it was very Southwest but 231 today um no real bad guesses pretty small countries like a pretty standard seed here um I'm actually really it's actually really cool to learn that there's a house there's a neighborhood in the National Park here um very cool I would like to visit kind of that that seems pretty cool um let's see how I think it's my the homies here it's gonna be it's a very small seed so like everyone's gonna have like 23 24k's so um we'll see what everyone did here I got third place um look at all of us and Darwin together yeah I don't think that just looked like Darwin to me um but the national park I guess makes sense usually when I think the national park I think of these two roads mainly where it's pretty distinct but then they didn't look like any of those any of those roads there everyone getting South Korea um getting Denmark there everyone went the same region I was a little slightly more south there but it's still north to me um as it did to everyone else there getting Netherlands everything in Poland so and obviously everything South Korea I'm actually the first one South there kind of kind of kind of loser but we'll take that um see how let's see how Blinky where's jhk play today is up here I'm gonna finally be a jhk day at 13 is that what it took me to finally beat the man um we'll take it how do we do how do we do how do we do everyone getting SK did anyone go over yo shout out to piver bro yeah shout out to piver on that that's a great guess I guess if you see it once like I probably will never forget that never heard again type thing so um shout out to paper for calling that calling a shot there um oh and then uh e5k yeah we have a street sign there so if you're able to know your Sweden that's doable and then Blinky getting the right Island and the Netherlands is the most Alpha thing I think I will ever see and then yeah generally everyone getting a pretty sternal region there as well so you know overall not a bad day we'll take that um we'll take that you know um also the fact we're on day 13 and people still think it's like impressive to 25k in 30 seconds I promise you're not cool dude I promise there's other ways to impress me I promise and that's actually played fairly smiling um let me know how you did on today's Challenge and I'll put tomorrow's Link in the description and best of luck on tomorrow's but mainly I'm liking what you guys are doing in the comments where you're like putting out every single um you're like round by round like how you messed up I think that's a good way to learn to see like just type out your your thought process and it's uh it's good maybe for other people's feedback and learn from that but um let me know how you doing today's and good luck on tomorrows and I'll see you tomorrow ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -12.67270888647849, "lng":

right it's day 13 of our daily feeling series where every single day i put a link in the description you guys play day ahead of me i go through and play the next day and we compare guesses we learn together and we play together i blundered it again guys i'll be honest i blundered again i had the whole day planned out and i was recording with wolf trekker i did today's daily challenge with wolf trekker which is another youtuber that does daily play along series i was like and a big inspiration to me as to start the series and i did the whole video with him and i forgot to record his audio how's that happen dude it's like geo wizard for you to record is me forgetting to record the audio so we're we're post commentating again okay and we'll do another video with world tracker soon i'm sorry will trigger i'm gonna still play this link in description if you guys are enjoying this play alongs he does play alongs as well it was my main learning focus every single time when i first started playing guesser i used his videos to learn so i owe a lot to him so we'll do another playoff series in the future round one here we had the cam cam paula carr um i immediately i mean this is one of the first things you learned you get here you get like the mirrors on the side with this like very distinct soil and fill with the housing um and think about uganda's coverage is the only coverage is really in kamphala and in south and in tabe but it was just camp paul and it's a free 49 points really so a very very easy seed very very easy round i should say um and i just kind of went to the map to see um to explain the car because i didn't explain it in the time but yeah very distinct you get that in kampala next round yeah and tibet you can also get more east a little slightly more east but it's very central coverage they're only in kampala um but yeah next round here we're going to be in just cynical we had you know very typical senegal rifts in the sky here we can see you get the car visible as well without the tape on the side and we're all the dirt on the side of the roads with these trees lined as well very senegalese um again it's slightly green so i was going to go south east of tuba kind of work south where near north of gambia where maybe i thought it was more green but i ended up not going near there um i don't know but yeah very very standard single is kind of a country i need to work migration guessing on um because i think it's a very learnable learn number learn the whole country so right here i'm just kind of lining up an east to west road where it made sense in hindsight there's a a a railroad to our north there that i should have been looking for but i don't think in the time of recording i was i i didn't make that connection so i didn't really look for the railroad there but still picking up four six again singles a pretty small country so not really losing too many points here um yeah there was a railroad north of that n3 there so very pretty five cable location really i'm sure there's not very many east-west roads with the earlier to the north so but life goes on um and we move on um again this video was with will tricker so a lot of it was me commenting with him and him explaining his guesses as well um but unfortunately i forgot to record man's audio so we'll do another video with him in the future though i'm also linking his channel in the description as well so here we have a black car black car is very helpful here with sun in the north we're in the southern hemisphere the black car with this terrain um it's gonna be argentina and presumably more south argentina where you get these like dead shrubs on the side of the road here it's this is way more common in the south um very very flat with these like very low vegetation and and very dry climate excuse me um so i ended up going pretty south here um i think i'm going slightly more north here because i didn't feel too south because i feel like maybe more i'd see or mountains or something just felt not that south to me um also black car in south america is argentina uruguay and peru peru also has black and white but argentina only has black car engine 4. so i end up going slightly more north and it was kind of met right region of argentina so slightly good guess there first you're guessing argentina we'll take it um i think world trekker going a little more south so um but again you just get this this black car very standard um kind of climate and vegetation for argentina here so um pretty standard freezing gas here um but yeah argentina is a very learnable country it's such a long country latitude um that you get all different types of climates so um but this out there looks pretty pretty similar so uh and here will trigger just explaining his guess is that's why we're kind of waiting on the delay here um and then round three here we're going to be in the philippines we're driving right with gen 4 coverage um with these chevrons and tuk tuks and then this way the coaster or south here um i think i blundered this around pretty pretty extremely um a common thing i do is called the cebu hedge where you just guess cebu because it's like very central philippines you also get english in the philippines as well so that was another another tell that we're going to be in the philippines um and then i was going to zoom in on this sign here because we had a sign with the church and i didn't read i didn't read it i didn't read it i didn't read i read the top verse at st joseph but i didn't read the bombers literally had the address where it said cebu on the right um cebu is an island in in uh in the philippines that's pretty big um or town in the philippines is pretty big and with a catholic church with coaster south this is a very very five cable location but i didn't read cebu but luckily i got the general general location from the vibes um but i blundered it because if i read i knew we're gonna be in cebu i could just scan the south coast and find the catholic church and line it up there but such is life um i think we'll trigger 5k here so um zooming in yeah we had the st joseph church there we knew it was cebu and we knew we had to cap uh water to the south there so uh very very very five cable there that's you could 5k that was probably within 20 seconds next round immediately we're going to south or new zealand and then turn around look to the north we have mountains who are north which means we're going to be in the south island usually get those snow-capped mountains only in the south island of new zealand like i said it looks like you'd go on vacation there it's always going to be south island so just kidding um but yeah driving left very typical architecture the sign behind store south is also in new zealand um like the green sign but this is just more of an immediate recognition of new zealand so um definitely south island here it's just like how south we're gonna be i was just looking standing around looking for a random neighborhood that maybe lined up but it was a little more north but still picking up four six points and ending up getting a 23.289 fairly easy seed i only one that really blundered was i think the senegalese went more near tuba obviously in hindsight and then i really really should have 5k at the cebu round i just unfortunately didn't read cpu on this sign so that's life will tricker did beat me on the seed he got 23.6 um so props to him the 5k in um the philippines was helpful there and his bare cynical guess but um this is a very 24 cable seed um even an mpz i think you could have probably got 24k on this because the philippines round was um to our north as well where we had to sign um but yeah pretty pretty centered guess my argentine i guess i'm kind of proud of um yeah longer the philly blundered the philly but that's life luckily i got the right origin there without the sign um here i was just kind of coping and i was like god i did say cebu the u was cut off there so maybe in hindsight i should have got it but the palms the palms there gave me the journal maybe more southern feel there more than anything though real meta real and true but yeah um pretty standard seat all around so i think here in a second i'm going to go through um friends scores and see how he did um here i am coping again i'm here i'm talking wolf tracker so it's like there's i'm trying to feel some dead air here but it's because wolf trekker's talking in the video that i forgot to record this audio let's see how to pot um gc and blinky did um yeah everyone getting um everyone getting sibu there um couple is not  is red new zealand we have one go bc everyone getting south of new zealand there everyone getting in the right general region of argentina um but yeah a pretty sooner day 23.2 we'll take that um i'll put tomorrow's link in the description let me know how you doing today's i'm also putting wolf checkers link in the description as well because i feel bad because i forgot to report his audio we'll do another one in the future um if there's anyone else you want me to do these daily challenges with let me know um i think this is a great opportunity to just kind of work with other people in the sphere of geographies here and chill and play some games together so um good luck on the mars and let me know how you doing today see you guys ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 0.4212326067836932, "lng": 32.57277860716641}, {"round": 2, "lat": 14.68078194324734, "lng": -16.39219542347282}, {"round": 3, "lat":

right we're back it's day 12 of our daily pulling Series where every single day I put a link in the description you play the next day I play the next day and then we learn together and play together yesterday did decent um I think I messed up a Brazil round or um something like that but today it's another day um I have no idea what to see is like let's start it together and play together round one looks like we're gonna be in Japan around the one we have a low cam um Gen4 often you get clearly Japanese cars and license plates and this baller to the circle on top oh very pretty nothing here indicates kind of weird in Japan so usually let's go Central as outside Tokyo um very very few Clues here that would I think help indicate for me at least where in Japan we are um it does feel somewhat more southernish but I say that and it's gonna be downtown Tokyo so I did kind of like Yamaguchi kind of area at first but um I'm gonna go a little more south maybe I go uh I'll go Obama I go I'll go slide more south like down here I think [Music] okay pays off a little bit we'll take that I I kind of want to go a little more south yet Yamaguchi we'll take it though we'll take it excuse me Sweden we have to dash out of short lines with the yellow engine for sign um very very we have winter coverage which is interesting um I don't think it's gonna be that South to be honest I think it might be a little more North this time kind of just outside Stockholm um you get these yellow outer lines and this is a snow Pole in Sweden and these yellow signs are very common in Sweden engine four um like somewhere over here I think it's vague that's most Swedish uh Town name ever I'm gonna go somewhere uh over here I think hedge a little more North maybe I don't think it's that North but I don't think it's down like too South either so I think this is safe right here maybe a closer to Norway we'll see but yeah and we have the red architecture everything here it's very very Swedish okay with South but that laugh goes on we have a Taiwan um driving right um uh Road lines here with language uh Taiwan drive's right Hong Kong drives left Japan drives left so big indicator is there um yeah I mean this was pretty like downtown like somewhere on the western side of Taiwan where you know you get most of the Cities um let me go here [Music] oh nice looks like that right City I didn't feel like to okay this is a fun Round Here this is not easy I mean I thought was Bulgaria or Romania we have no antenna there's ever North Master Serbia this is not an easy round at all it's a very very hard round no antenna usually makes you think Serbia or North Macedonia but I don't think it's either of those I think some people Gary Romania my best guess here based off his landscape it could be Serbia I don't think so show me with no antenna somewhere over here it's gonna be Romania I think or north um Cloud covers yeah okay we'll send it wow I was never going Spain there was never even a thought I don't think yeah that wasn't even a thought that's just now that is just oh this is Norway I think and four exposed rock no this is Scotland should be Norway should be nowhere driving right the house looks cost for me for a second I was kind of confused um but yeah this is gonna be somewhere in Norway got some more uh neutronheim um get more south rough day rough day um I think this is a very I'm very interested in seeing how many people got Spain there I could have just been bad guess in my end but um yeah back you're guessing in Scandinavian countries there and I got my I got my Asia guest so I got my Asian guesses we'll see we'll see I don't expect to do very well here yeah um okay yeah so I had Dragon logs in North Mass with me Sweden um two in Spain uh Spain but the S is literally silent um but that's the beauty of these games is it's it's uh it's all it's all Raw um see right now here um all right I just want to see where other people went here sweet it's JK Spain it's a product went turkey I like the turkey guest there to be honest I felt like this reason to me Serbia remain Bulgaria I got gasified by the entertainment but I probably would have ended up going to Romania Bulgaria there um yeah I mean not too not too bad um that's a very hard ground with very little Clues so I'm not really I'm not really upset about that at all um yeah we saw a bunch of cheaters on the top so you guys are herbs but um yeah generally not I mean I think that was my first missed country in a while so um we'll take that um shout out to jsk and um ning we're getting Spain there but um put tomorrow's link down in the description let me know how you did it on today's um and good luck on tomorrows see you guys ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 33.85962634698022, "lng":

right it's day 11 of our daily playlist series where every single day i put a link in the description you play day ahead of me i play next day and we learn and we play together and that's it yesterday we had a black screen today i'm on um you know we're gonna bring it back we're gonna bring it back okay um first game of the day as always so let's see how i do round one um it's gonna be south africa we have the white car driving left um i think and his overall is like very vegetation is uh let me look at the sun too we can see the sun's in the north we're seeing me we're gonna be in the southern hemisphere as far as the region guessing in south africa i feel like i have to go somewhere near pretoria here it's kind of dry with these hills um yeah i don't know it could be way more south to be honest but i think this is a safe guess usually you get tons of mountains down here could be maybe more coastal but it feels a little too dry so we'll see nice that's a great guess i'm kind of like that region to me so we'll take that round two we're in australia man we're just really on the southern hemisphere driving left to grind um okay i'm kind of just looking real quick let's see what we got we're on the north to south road i feel like a i don't know where pilgrims do i want to go rural queensland like western queensland queensland's in my head weren't free after yesterday this could be wah i don't think it's well actually should i scan for i can't read that north to south road i mean we don't have any polls yeah i don't know where this is somewhere in australia that's all i got um we'll see it could be like western australia could be south australia um what's in this w life goes on and we're gonna be in france um we got the blue sticker on the telephone pole here this is um key to france except um and you get those in like maybe vic as well we got a lighter pole here spf also when i say ladder pools in europe it's spf you also get ladder poles in ecuador brazil um senegal nigeria but in europe s p f okay um sometimes belgium as well but we don't got that um we also have the thick ballard which is key to france or scotland um i don't know it feels pretty like countryside paris i'll go somewhere in this region yep make sense round four this scotland white house uh definitely like uk or scotland i can't see the back of this plate here um immediately it feels kind of like this northern region of like ireland or scotland though it's kind of the climate um in the architecture here um we have the yellow stickers on the poles don't mean much to me i might just go scotland i might just go scotland huh in it um this is scotland yeah i'll go i'll go i'll go i'll go see town that's town let's go let's go right here it's gonna be it's gonna be out in this house right here somewhere um we'll see yeah we'll see scotland more north but we'll take that then we have brazil we have um gen 4 camera so when you're in south america with gen 4 it's like um well actually nowadays it's like uh brazil argentina northern argentina chile colo and mexico with these road lines and overall vegetation it very much feels like brazil especially with these double yellow inner lines um and it feels like maybe somewhere near rio with like kind of like green rolling hills to our north so i think somewhere in this region is probably good um yeah i think this is safe maybe this region um so we'll see yeah just piranha um overall pretty good good game i i get nsw wrong um what happened was it was it was a mental game because yesterday i went queensland i was like if i missed queensland twice in a row that's a bad luck right and now i want queensland on instagram yesterday i went in something in queensland such as life such is life um let's see how i did today not too bad everyone kind of gained the same region of um brazil there everyone getting the same region of south africa um and yeah only three people are getting nsw there i'm only one in queensland my second thought was wah with the red soil color that's like extremely common you get kind of like that same soil color in law i'll be honest i think western australia is a better guess in this w [Music] why is there why is this dirt color in nsw no yeah that's a very interesting round but skill issue i guess shout out to eamon and max for going while they're not not bad um the guy from the britain did not get scotland right but everyone else got scotland chumley it's okay man um and yeah everyone getting france their general region france so again australia really um messed me up but we'll take it uh how did bokie do bulky messed me said he was he almost got 24k yeah he messed up the brazil final round um yeah it's quite nice um bookie moment also boki deleted his account so he doesn't have verification anymore that's a product due jhk and blinky should be enough yeah um jhk went vic to pilate and sw blinky my boy blanket queensland represent i went way too north queensland i it's too dry dude it's too dry bro it's too dry everyone getting that that's me coping by the way yeah so not too bad not too bad pretty soon guesses all around the board um but life goes on let me know how you did on today's challenge and i'll put tomorrow in the description so you can play a day ahead and uh best of luck on tomorrow's but also let me know i wanna know how you did where'd you go on uh australia here and if you went in this w you're i don't believe you goodbye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -27.57550424103147, "lng": 28.376400007543566}, {"round": 2, "lat":

right we're back it's day nine of our daily playlist series where every single day i put a link in description you guys play mars i play the day after you guys play today and then you compare scores we learn together we play together and um hopefully we don't laugh at my guesses um today i've heard news that the fifth round is broken unfortunate but we move on round one we'll be in australia very fun aussie round here we have double white outer lines um our white outer lines white inner lines what can i see here that helps me immediately i feel like we're going to be somewhere in like vic or nsw this is a very nondescript australia though we also have the white road lines in the middle and outer it's different from south africa driving left no through road corrigan road i mean that's too small to find it feels like vic southern i feel like floodways someone told me once that floatway signs are super common in a state i think it might have been nsw i don't remember it's like one of the states that um floods in australia a lot i forgot which one though i think nsw is a good guess though it could technically be queensland or something but i'm gonna go maybe over here and nsw like hedging for victoria okay well just queensland maybe queensland is the one that floods a lot um we have a french baller here pretty standard um so i'm gonna go maybe somewhere over here in this region um scotland also has these ballards but we're driving right we have the sign on the right here um pretty soon ground gen 2 i like somewhere northish um maybe near belgium so we'll go like right over here yep we'll take that round three we're risking big countries today aren't we running brazil i like southern brazil here though um we have the red dirt very brazilian dirt you get this like red tent on the road as well very commonly in brazil um but these in the black the back of the sign here is black which is very common in brazil and only in brazil and south america um these trees feel very southern to me is my main um the reason why i say that it feels very much like piranha sao paulo region maybe even more south to be honest um it definitely feels like southern brazil so let me go somewhere maybe over here i think it could be more south but yeah bring us somewhere like right here nice not too bad was that region you get those like cluttered trees i feel like a lot very green trees in the south there and then we just have a thailand um a hillside south here like a small little hill um tide pole again you have this like the the many dots going up uh very common in in thailand and you have this light post that sticks out into the middle right there which is very tight as well plus gen 4 you don't get that in cambodia or wow vietnam isn't covered anymore google removed coverage in vietnam um and laos and cambodia also drive right so good good indicators there uh as far as region guessing here we do have the hills to the south um i don't know i feel like it could be somewhere like central um not maybe two near bangkok i don't think it's too north either so it's not gonna be peninsula so the summer movie over here yep pretty i guess there in thailand and then we get a um a black screen um maybe i can pick up points here i have no idea where it is i didn't ask anyone um is it ever i'm going to strategically think about how i can play this hi brazil i feel like very common you get south africa victoria or is it just best to go central europe i know maybe people might want eiffel tower but that's i'm trying to get some points here i messed up my aussie gas okay i really just go to russia kyrgyzstan i'm gonna go kyrgyzstan i'm gonna go i'm gonna go ash what if what if it's ash philippines okay imagine um all right so ignore that read the black screen okay but um overall a pretty good pretty good region guessing besides my queensland guests here um i think why i went uh nsw here and still being queenslander i think when you're guessing australia are the two most common um ones people confuse me me as well um i think the flow sign maybe is i in my mind i thought it was more common in uh nsw i think that's why i ended up going there but um i'm going to fact-check myself and see after that but uh i'm assuming my friends did okay they had some queensland guesses there um i wish i could remove the final guest um i have an eiffel tower that's respect uh but yeah every game france um antarctica everyone getting the right southern region brazil there um yeah all the points right region of thailand all the points really came from whoever got the best aussie guests here and unfortunately i didn't so um such is life such is life but we'll take it we'll take it um hopefully tomorrow's he doesn't have a black screen so we can have a full five of five but uh link's in the description now you can play tomorrow's i'll play it tomorrow you can compare your scores and we can learn together so um let me know how you've done today's and um good luck on the mars ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -25.88506329037802, "lng": 148.5491872724478}, {"round": 2, "lat": 49.83562744606631, "lng": 3.165062447929186}, {"round": 3, "lat":

"we're back it's day nine i believe of our daily planning series where every single day i put a link in the description where you play a challenge a day ahead of me and i put the day after and then you compare your scores and we see how we do we play together and we learn together um yesterday fine i missed the brazil round final this is being recorded exactly 100 5 am pst so i have a tournament in 55 minutes however i do on this challenge right now is going to is going to just tell how i do in the tournament um round one here i believe we're going to be in thailand airtight or philippines i can't tell what the road we're driving on very interesting oh we have a tide pole here yeah so immediately i thought this sign right here was facing on the right side of the road which is why i maybe thought philippines for a second but yeah this is just gonna be thailand very common you get this like concrete road condition in thailand as well as something uh type hole as you get this like light post that sticks out in the middle of the road here and it has like these these like holes that go like very like all the way up to the top but the main distinct thing in tide poles is this long uh hole that sticks in the middle and it's like pretty mountainous which inclines me to go north thailand where it gets pretty hilly up here so i'm just gonna go on some road maybe over here and here we are and you also get mountains down there so that's life but yeah oh i mean we're just doing a south asia southeast asia tour today aren't we well we have malaysian flag not the us um but so we also have gen 4 cameras so gen 4 is the newest coverage of like this high saturation camera and when you're in malaysia you cannot have gen 4 on borneo island so that means you have to be in mainland so i mean it feels pretty urban i'm sure i said kale to be honest like it feels like a pretty safe guess so um sure yeah it was just kale next round here we're going to be in an interesting round this is a french pole this is a hard seat um so we have long antenna white car i mean it could be france anything about this for a second definitely europe never slovakia it's either like southern france i think or like italy i think i'm like italy now huh yeah i'm not sure i kind of like italy now but i think it could be france let me go france is my first instinct i think this is a ladder poll is why i say that is it ever corsica it was course i hate it here final round here um i think this is just czechia um i think this is check-in oh no i think this could be the gen force of lochia ever that could be interesting this might be dreamforce slovakia because we have the antenna on the car here um i guess i could scan i don't think there's gonna be big enough cities um so slovakia gen four's news they're like a domain or something oh it has the sk right there yeah so maybe somewhere easter selaki yeah okay on the round is going to be just a can that looks like we have ra on the side here it's gonna be french quebec so pretty standard here maybe somewhere around also france uses stop on their stop signs so uh this is the only place you get r a is in uh quebec it's very sometimes very rarely outside quebec as well um maybe more north to be honest so no was just more south i mean not the worst score um 21-9 i called corsica but like i don't know why i didn't send that um and my title i guess was bad but besides that it's i'm expecting a lot of people to beat me here um oh okay did pretty decent um yeah so we all thought north tied those mountains that's a very center north thai feel um yeah gen 4 can't be borneo there so we all got that all getting r a no one went course well i'm assuming we'll have like blinky or jhk that went course there i can i gouge definitely went course oh my gosh from italy okay that makes me feel better um let's see what the product did let's see how blinky tell me something like course just tell me someone um oh wow they all went italy i think that was a french poll which is why i decided to go there but i never i didn't end up doing course i it was either me southern france or course to me so um and yeah blinky moment though all three of them moments there yeah that's there's a town name there so i probably should have scanned but cringe just kidding just kidding everyone getting kale yeah and uh depositing southern thailand there okay um pretty standard i'll put tomorrow's link in the description let me know how you did on today's and um i'll see you guys tomorrow also if you're watching this within three hours of it being posted i will be live from 11am to 2 pst live twitch.tv slash dreambolt doing a project tournament so if you want to see all these guys competing at a high level together um go to twitch if

"welcome back to day eight of our daily playlist series where every single day i put a challenge link in the description you guys play a day ahead of me and then when i play the next day and we learn together play together and have fun together but most importantly importantly we learn together you might be able to tell i very fumbled a bag today i forgot to record my audio so this is this is uh post rainbolt talking to you i'm explaining guesses um i'm sorry it won't happen again um but yeah so we do what we gotta do though okay we have double yellow airlines here which are found in mainly the middle east is very common you get these yellow outer lines yellow outer lines very very common here so you get israel jordan and uae but i was showing that uae is the only country with a white google car jordan has black and israel has a long antenna so plus with the overall you know vegetation everything like that language very uae here i immediately thought wait is this pole gonna be the iron knob pole that we had in that world cup that i lost on but like no this looks feels very queensland and we had town names there so i immediately should start scanning into queensland here um after i realized that like yeah it's definitely queensland and it's like okay i can probably find winton and longreach and i immediately zoomed in to where the vegetation looks like in queensland which would be like more western because more easter gets green and i immediately found longreach pretty big on the map there and we knew wynton was going to be 130 miles to the north and long range is only 50 miles to the south um but i was just scanning i was like wait this road to our uh west isn't covered in street view or so i thought and so i was just like wait what so i was like okay we're working with a2 somewhere um and that's when i was just like i'll just guess kind of like what i thought it made sense like originally it's kind of in the middle of the road it was slightly more south and i zoomed in and it was on the road it was covered just had to zoom in a lot it's because it was a dirt path but i just didn't care didn't look to zoom in so that's fine um round three here we had a pretty standard senegal um very very you know single leaves with the rift in the sky the car rack driving right cynical drives right so is ghana and nigeria but other than that you know it just feels very like cynical also had a single flag there but who needs that when you have a rift right um as far as like region guessing um i was kind of looking around it felt like we had these like pretty green trees um and it still felt pretty dry so my immediate thought was like okay i think we're gonna be somewhat south of tuba um so i went um south of tuba kind of in this region where i felt like i had seen something similar to this region before and um yeah it was indeed south of tupa there pretty good points 25 kilometers away and this one i was mentioning earlier we had these double yellow outers again but this time we have a long antenna which means we're going to be in israel so immediately it felt like we're gonna be in like palestine but i i totally palestine usually has a follow car behind you in palestine so uh i didn't really put two and two together there um israel such a small country doesn't really matter but it did feel like kind of like nowhere near tel aviv to me so i went kind of more east but it actually ended up being near haifa which israel's such a small country doesn't really matter and then around five here i mean recognizing to be like north brazil um we have the lighter poles which indicates we're going to be in brazil as far as like vegetation brazil goes it's like very very dry and you get these like trees like these low trees and like shrubs um very very very common in like northeast brazil um very brazilian dirt as well obviously but i was confused because i thought this red dirt was interesting for northeast brazil because usually in northeast you get more of kind of like a a white-ish soil gray soil so it's like it's a little red so i was kind of nervous of like going to north um or even west i thought it could maybe more west which is why the soil clear was kind of like that um and so i ended up clicking kind of right here i clicked way too south of this last second for some reason and clicked center and entered and i fumbled the bag on that brazil but overall it's pretty solid score um pretty easy seed again um really one really good single guess two small countries that are pretty free points and then it really comes down on whoever gets the best score has probably ever got the best brazil guess here so um look at my friends everyone had these very similar guesses we all had very similar scores everyone got the right got the a2 in australia everyone you know very standard uae israel and then senegal my guest in circle was pretty good so it helped but my brazil i i fell short which is why my score is a little bit lower because i could have easily picked up a thousand fifteen hundred points there but um yeah see how jhk and blinky did jhk the ghk things um and then blinky you know exactly what you would expect from the man so like i said it really comes down to whoever got the best score whoever got the best brazil gets there but um yep sorry i fumbled the bag on today's video with the audio i hope this was you know good enough and um i'll put tomorrow's link down description and um good luck tomorrow and let me know how you did on today's i'll see you guys tomorrow bye ", "locations":

"we're back it's day seven i think day seven one week a daily play along series um where i put in a link in the description where you play tomorrow's play along challenge and then i'll play the day after and then you can compare your scores i can look at my scores we can share my thought process and we can all learn together that's the goal here is to learn together play together have fun and um very casually yesterday i lost sleep last night over going um belgium on france but um redemption yeah you know how we come back what doesn't kill makes you stronger um so let's see what we got today we got a poland okay we got polish ballers these like white red white um it goes end to end um and we have a holy pole here um wait dude i feel like i've seen this before no i don't think i have um usually if it's like very hilly it's like southern poland i do feel somewhat south here to be honest let's see if we have a town name or something um i mean we do have here like something that looks very polished there but nothing that sticks out um poland also commonly has these green signs um i like somewhere like over here i think i'm not too sure i do like somewhere in this region i feel like i've seen a similar like looking feel somewhere like very southwest over here but like um i don't know i think this is a safe bet i think but we'll see okay more east but we'll take that round two is a pretty standard france i believe here um not denmark not belgium um so we have roux this is french ruiz frencher street um very commonly you get these low signs in france um so very very common there if you see this made on atv you're usually in southern imagine um we also have ladder poles um spain portugal france um spf 30 um good way to remember i just i feel like i remember hearing that somewhere but spf if if you see ladder poles put your sunscreen on okay because it's spain portugal france oh bars as far as region here also in in europe actually lighter poles are swinging portugal france region here i want to go somewhere i don't know i feel somewhat more north-ish maybe actually no i don't i don't at all maybe this region we'll see it feels pretty not that region we have mexico oh lord again we have these black water tanks i don't cr don't count me i feel like i've only seen these in mexico we have the standard antenna with one stripe this is only found in columbia mexico ecuador in brazil um cambodia has three of these stripes we got uh if you see if you see this card you're gonna be in mexico let's be honest we have some cacti it feels pretty dry i'm a coward so i want to go see dmx maybe more north i think more west ish i'm not too sure mountains to the north yeah i don't know i i can't do anything but go see the mixture i feel like i do it might be a slightly more north i don't think so i think this is i think this is safe yeah i mean standard we got ozzy okay hell gives my aussie here we have australian bollards um where it's like the white red white um okay hot take i immediately thought this was tasmania with gentoo coverage with these like very crowded trees it's definitely going to be like taz or south australia vic let me look see if i can see anything that my instant thought was taz i might send tabs here i don't know i feel like these trees gen 2 do we see any tumbling poles it could be vic michael vick don't want me playing safe though i'm gonna go taz i'll go tazzy i don't think this is tad so i think it's gonna be fake oh well we'll see okay thick border l plus ratio plus we're in italy um yes we got the short front plates here double blue strip pretty standard we have the tumbler aesthetic on the on the um signs here where everything is lower case but yeah you get short blue front double blue front short plates is only in italy you also get double blue strips in albania and france but they're not short on the front and usually in italy you get these parking signs very commonly i'm trying to find that usually has a town name on it where there's no parking and it has a town name do you think we're gonna be somewhat like near florence or something um maybe near bologna um yeah i'm not too sure uh score is not the best small countries my original guessing in these countries has been pretty pretty um apprehensive not apprehensive abnormal um yeah just more south 20.5 uh this is one of those where it's like a very it's a very easy seed with very obvious countries so like anyone could beat me in this because it just kind of comes down to region guessing um yeah it's a very very standard seed today let's see how my homies did last place thank you tripoda for going tasmania with me um yeah all good guesses here um i'm gonna add some more of the see if i have anyone else i remember i can point out deposit let's see what the product did blinky even though it's even though it's even though it's anything else all right that's good okay they went this w honestly i felt like at the end it was gonna be somewhere in this region of vic which i i should have seen the next hedge blinkies french that makes sense um going more south of italy right region poland yeah very very marginal score difference but uh solid nonetheless very like i said windows like see that's just like a very easy country guessing um to where from there is just kind of whoever gets closer like one round a couple of rounds um but yeah not too not too shabby we'll take it i'll put tomorrow's link down in the description um and you can play day ahead of me but let me know how you did today and good luck on the mars ",

right it's day five of our daily play along Series where I send a link to the Mars play along you guys can play a day ahead of me and I'll play it the next day and we can compare scores and learn together and play together um yesterday I kind of fumbled the bag but that's the beauty of the game and the beauty of these is that one take Andy so whatever happens happens and I explain my guess as we go if we can learn and um if I make a bad guess and make a bad guess round one here it's very very interesting so immediately I noticed we have the red tint on the on the plates this is a Belgium thing with the Gen 2 coverage um so we're gonna be in Belgium here you get this like red tint on these plates you can see across all of all of Belgium um Gen 2 coverage is also pretty common as far as reason guessing uh I mean I don't we're just in a pretty Urban setting here I don't think it's too big of a city um it's safe to go somewhat Central I think just for to maximize points that's the me going for the highest score here but uh definitely gonna be in Belgium because of these plates like I mentioned you can see the red there maybe more prevalently prevalently um yeah World architecture as well um you kind of see the same like flat siding in both France and Belgium but with those plates for me in Belgium was more south but we'll take that round two here is New Zealand we have New Zealand um signs here where it's like blue and you kind of get that I don't know I just you get these like blue colored signs in New Zealand here um we can also look at the Sun and see it's in the north which will tell us we're in the southern hemisphere um I don't know man I'm not the best at Region guessing New Zealand we have 35 seconds um something fun about like New Zealand too is like most every city has distinct colors or like has distinct signs most major cities this is pretty standard though um like Wellington has like green signs things like that um but I'm not too sure I do like North Island here candidly there's like we do have slight mountain or slight Hills or west there um I don't know I think north islands is a safe guess so I guess not violent I was just North Island North Island well I like to say usually is if it looks like you want to go on vacation there it's probably South Island that's usually my world uh that's a that's that's that's a fake meta okay it's just a really pretty like snow-capped mountains down there um so usually when it's more flat you don't see like a bunch of Hills or mountains I usually just go north island and it works we'll take that oh from Mexico I think we have this like water tank which I think is distinct to Mexico this black one don't quote me on that I know I've seen those a lot in Mexico we have a pickup truck here which is very common Mexico as well it looks like we have the hexagonal such octagonal poles here as well um but another big clue is this antenna when you get this on the back of the car with like one wire it's gonna be in Mexico Colombia Ecuador or Brazil um but yeah everything here leads to Mexico and my history with Mexico is usually a central guesting in cdmax it's usually a good guess this one more dry so I might go a little more North um maybe just slight Hills nothing too crazy though but I feel like it's a safe region over here somewhere I could I I feel like every time you get mixed I lose a lot of points so um okay I swear it pays off you know that's where it pays off it looks like we're gonna be in just Canada here uh Lord have mercy my soul this is not good for boy I'm infamously bad at Canada um see the thing I was I always get mixed up is Newfie and Vancouver it's such a bad um I should be better you know I need to be better um but Canada oftentimes you can feel like this like yellow thingy on signs or like on liposed and um uh in like the North America it just feels more Canadian to me though um especially it looks like we might have a faded single yellow line here I do like more Eastern here I actually low-key don't like Newfie though I have 10 seconds where do I want to go let me go more yeast I think it might be new people I'm gonna hedge like Nova Scotia New Brunswick okay let's get back all right and I'm not missing the 50 50 this time because I have more clues um this is gonna be Ireland on the back plate driving left we have um dashed yellow outer lines as well so we have the yellow Dash hour line so these are yellow Dash our lines are usually found in Ireland which is where we are because we're driving left with a blue strip and um a white license plate they're found in New Zealand as well um we're also the dash found I think there might be found in um Portugal I think I've seen these in Portugal um but yeah these are super common New Zealand and Ireland but the UK does not have yellow Dash or yellow dashed outer lines so that's a key thing to know you're in Ireland as well as driving left with a blue strip and no yellow so more clues here than yesterday so we'll take that I'm gonna end up with a pretty decent score here nothing too crazy but that's about as bad as I guess you could have in Ireland to be honest but no I mean no real bad guesses besides part of me thought it could be Ontario I don't think I would have ever gone Quebec there though um it's a problem really my only bad guess um I think why went so I went here was because Newfie is just rent free in my head somewhere it just it just lives rent-free man um so but yeah I did get Canada so we'll take that um Ireland I mean sure Belgium small country nothing too impressive there North Island and then yeah I just it felt like the Mexico City region there um see how it did compared to the homies okay pretty standard scores um it's getting more Central there uh some go Finland let's book in Belgium not too bad yeah it's pretty standard seed nothing too crazy I'm gonna see if any of my other uh so jhk did oops cheers yeah pretty identical guesses to be honest wow look at us um yeah he got cute back though so yeah we'll take it though um we'll take it you bunch of Cheaters man you guys are herbs with all due respect um with all of your respect you guys are weird but uh yeah I'll put tomorrow's Link in the description uh so you guys can play um tomorrow's play along series um deadhead me and let me know how you do down two days and

right we're back it's day four of our daily play along series where i put a link in the description to tomorrow's link to play um and then i'll play you guys play the headmate and then we can compare scores and learn together um yesterday how did i do i did pretty well yesterday had a couple little hiccups um i think something important to note for these games is this is the longest i've ever spent on rounds in my life i don't think i've ever spent longer than 10 seconds on the game in six or seven months um mainly because i i i'm not like it's something i should do more which is why i'm doing this but so when i make hiccups like not knowing the town name or scanning over something that's maybe pretty obvious it's it's a train thing that i haven't really it's a muscle that i haven't really trained as much it's more intuition like immediately recognizing countries and getting regions fairly quickly so getting further into signage and things like that is something i'm working on so um please do not well actually me in the comments i'm learning as well okay um i'm used to zero following second npc not one minute painting so let's start and let's see how we do today we're gonna be in sweden again we have gaten which is swedish for street and we have these white dash airlines excuse me i think we're gonna be south again it seems pretty flat um swedish flag as well everyone is probably gonna get the country here i like very south sweden um so i'm gonna go maybe let's go in the little town here savage joe we're gonna be on this street right here probably imagine um i mean no but yeah so very flat in south sweden hopefully good guess we'll see maybe even more south actually i like it even more south risk for the biscuit let's go let's find another little small village let's go here okay oh wow that makes sense um just over there honestly i probably see this is this thing i always do there's a sign right there but like i didn't even look think to look at this sign because i just when you're playing so quickly it you never get um you don't get to the opportunity even read sides so it's i think we're gonna be in ireland here driving left it feels very much like ireland got some some sheep but um i don't know it could be the uk it could be like north like scotland or something like that and i think this might be irish though i think that sign might be irish i'm not too sure um but we're driving left it's gonna be the uk or ireland so we're gonna pick up points anyways but i do feel more irish here um could be wrong though could be wrong if it's wrong it's an l but it's kindly sometimes just a 50 50. but this this kind of green rolling hills and everything makes me feel like it's gonna be more ireland so i'll just go central maybe a little more south okay it was whales we take that that's fine honestly this immediately looks like we're gonna be in spain or portugal um i like more spay in here i think we have gen two uh there's like white lines of this vegetation um right now i'm looking for like a no hunting sign or something of the like excuse me um yeah i don't think i see anything that will indicate i i do feel more spanish here though um so i'm gonna go somewhere maybe over here in spain um just based off the vegetation um get these like hills with like these scattered trees on it with these like triple white road lines it's gonna be spain or portugal here uh presumably so go here that's very south bad score but life goes on um and we're gonna be in just portugal here this time pretty sleeper seat again we have the yellow strip and license plate which is found in old cars it's found in a newer coverage i think they were the the yellow strip in like 2020 in march 2020 so you don't see that if you have new coverage but the yellow strip is only in portugal we have the ladder poles here with like the holes in them like the mini holes in that's portuguese as well and overall just like this very red roofing is a very very uh like this it's overall this rear thing is very portuguese so small country it doesn't feel too north to me to be honest so i'm gonna go it's over here l plus ratio plus it was north and then we have a us and it looks like it just highway 221 i don't know my highways it does feel north uh this is a jhk moment i guarantee this man 5k that okay i'm going to scan for probably two i feel like it's somewhere in nebraska i was trying to think for a second um sorry just trying to think for a second if anyone that has like ever studied the us will definitely know what highway where highway 221 is though is the thing so i have to go pretty much just vibes here i'm gonna get pretty bad score i mean we're gonna get above 20k which is fine i guess kevin l but i really like this nebraska for some reason or somewhere over here don't know we'll go with this um okay with montana 220 right there yeah i mean we didn't get 20k okay we barely got 20k kind of an l i got the grand country there that's fine and then two i mean previous bad sleeper but that's fine um yeah not the best score but let's see how i did it against my homies um okay be dragon logs that's that's that's okay um okay everyone got the right region there i feel like this isn't like nebraska isn't a bad guess like this for certain reason there um yeah i only i was only one ireland so that's an l um i was just getting spain there i went way too north um and everyone in portugal not too bad i know my friend's list is glitching if there's anyone here let's see how blinky did okay um also you guys on the top of the leaderboard you guys have no lives and are weird for cheating yeah blinky moment there as well um yeah pretty standard pretty standard i mean we'll take that honestly not the best score not the worst um kind of my only really fumble i think really bad guess i don't think i really had any bad guesses but um i think i could have got um the uk here yeah maybe that looks i mean hindsight but yeah we take that though we take it um i'll put tomorrow's link down the description and you can let me know how you do ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 57.17136102608217, "lng": 16.997511685232247},

right we're back with day three of the play along series where every single day i'm putting a challenge link to tomorrow's in the description where you guys can play day ahead of me and compare scores and learn together and play together um yesterday i threw russia today i'm on my redemption arc and um i did get banff though i'll give myself that i take it banff um but i i missed russia and mexico pretty badly and it was very embarrassed with my score so we're going to go for a redemption today and see what we can do here this is a very interesting one why did i think this was gin for uh colombia i have no idea what this is i thought this was new gym oh we have columbia cross okay so generation four coverage is um new in colombia so i'm not really used to this on adw uh so um it's basically the newest camera quality and we have the columbia cross here which is very helpful um but mainly these fences gave away the columbian feel for me um you often get these fences on the southern columbia um but yeah i was like really confused there for a second um so i'm gonna go somewhere over uh central columbia it feels like maybe somewhat more over here not really sure okay that's a good guess we'll take that round two okay we're gonna be in southern tunisia we have the fall car again from the series from daily challenge zero one um but this is a dark color card which means it's going to be excuse me um probably from like somewhere up here from like seuss sus um down to like uh get best um i think a safe hedge for me here is facts um is there any town names i can see um look for a second i don't think so i don't think so uh i don't think so all right so i'm seeing those facts here uh it's a pretty safe guess um so actually look at this car one more time bro is giving the thumbs up man that's cool okay okay it was a little more north that's actually really it's kind of uh i think this is like as far west as you can go in tunisia coverage um everything over here isn't covered at all it's all like the east side so um but 4 600 that's fine round three here looks like sweden with these dashed outer lines here um uh common you get these like mailboxes and red architecture and scandinavian as well um these white dash our lines are like sweden uh estonia sometimes like france romania the short ones norway has the longer ones um but very very common and sweet in here also don't get confused these with the holy poles these are not those that you find in hunger remaining in poland um let me give someone southern here i think um feels it's slightly hilly though which kind of confuses me but i'll go like somewhere over here it could be a little more north all right 47 we're on a good pace so far can we keep it up and what looks like mexico no it should just be mexico here oh man yes we have a mexico pole here we have short plates mexico only has short plates that's what i was looking at right there is like do we have different lengths everything here is a short plate and not very wide um also when you get these poles are like very octagonal um so there's like eight sides um it's like concrete that's a mexico pole we have a cell digit here dude i forgot my error codes oh that's not good i really should learn my mixer error codes again i learned them for a turn at one time and i for gore i know that six is like over here somewhere i don't know i think a cdmx head is safe again but i'm not too sure okay we'll take that honestly 4k in mexico not the easiest um and i think this is going to be serbia um based off just vibes facing forward here we have a blue strip on the plate um which means we're gonna be uh not in like croatia which kind of have similar vibes the biggest thing for server two is we have no antenna on the back of the car here which is very common in north macedonia and serbia when you're in europe um when you look in the back you don't have an antenna you're more than likely going to be in serbia or north macedonia um but yeah this is that does that have a blue strip this one does so this yellow sign up here makes me think it could be crow but i think it works where you should be in serbia i'm going north serbia here um and hope for the best and we take that pretty good day i think um not the hardest seed to be honest a pretty standard seed but um 23k let's see how i compared against my homies um only four of us played so got second how did that where do you all guess i should have had more of a cdmx hedge there that's my bad um okay both two of them knowing the town there shout out to them um going capital there kind of makes sense i think there was like a bank that said tunis on it um so maybe that's what they thought there but the the dark color car can't be found that north um and all this getting serbia pretty standard serbs and then yeah i got the south vibes from uh sweden there okay um nice we'll take it we'll take it and i'll put tomorrow's in the description so you can get a day ahead and compare scores and we'll learn together um thanks for watching see you guys ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 4.897885993143343, "lng":

right we're on day two um i just woke up i have a tournament in 40 minutes i haven't even practiced for it all this will be my practice game if it's any indication of yesterday you guys are a bunch of cowards and uh not really but i'm referring to the people that uh don't tell me this is banff i'm referring to the people that cheated or used my scores to their advantage i think we're in banff dude if you guys know if you guys know me and my history with banff it's not a good one it's not a good one in the tournament i lost a round because of miscommunication on banff and i think if i miss it again i wouldn't be able to live with myself we have a maximum sign here this is canadian that's how we know we're not in the us here um because u.s uses speed limit um okay i'm going banned because if even if it isn't even if it isn't banff if like if it is bad if i don't guess banff i can't have the curse um wait do we have a street sign or like uh something a street name okay it's probably somewhere it has to damp okay 5k oh dude this is eastern russia i think so we have black on the bottom of the pole here um which is russian with cyrillic um long and tandem big intersection bollards fan it feels like very green i don't know russia is a devastating country it feels very very green but usually in eastern russia like over here you get white car so maybe it's like over here it could be super west and this is a really bad gas to be honest but like it feels so east to me i don't know i'm gonna lose a lot of points here i suck at russia very wet well should be east whatever dude i'll guess over here this is mexico um so we have the gen 4 with a mexico pole here short plates uh this is darwin region um listen guys i got i got the countries um so we have uh we have uh there's like this driving left with these triple white road lines plus um sorry i have a little sniffles plus these like this vegetation like this like soil on the east to west road in northern territories so presumably the one here um i guess it could be wah like west also people saying no one in what and australia calls it wa it's w-a yeah but wah sounds a lot cooler okay i sound like a epic gamer i say yeah we're in wah um but do you think we're in nt uh tell me where do i want to go could we be like here this is pretty east to west road this is a problem why should because this is like well i'm worried it's gonna be like okay it was there and then we have south africa presumably just outside espatini la sutu here we have gen 2 coverage i'm driving left um you can see because of the stop signs on the left-hand side we have like somewhat of a mountain range here oh we have i should probably scan r541 i really should spend some time and learn my um also gen 4 or gen 2 coverage is only in south africa so we have this wide blur on top you can't be in botswana su-2 or esratini bad plus look we're gonna be somewhere in this region servants gonna scan for a second okay it wasn't your satani uh can i find that i should have found that i did say like in the beginning it's either gonna be a nearly suit or esportini so it's okay um horrible score um pretty bad honestly we got five or five for country and i got the five cam banff but like russia man i don't know why i thought that was that east i'm gonna look at it look at that again yeah no man i don't think i ever go west here i guess you'd have a bunch of birch such as life and in mexico i think i was just like stud locked from russia i was kind of upset but i've ever gone north here the thing about playing adw is that like the best guess is always cdmx that's the problem i'm like it is pretty dry um but like this could be anywhere in mexico really within region within reason um okay i'm also not gonna look at uh anyone's scores because you guys are a bunch of cheaters okay i'm gonna look at my friends to see how i compared and i got last because my friends are smart um let me see where they went do i have anyone i know i went east okay cool this got banff most of us got banff uh two three of us got the right road there honestly it's just my so my rush i guess was horrible why do i think that was east bro and yeah i'm presumably people found the road there yeah makes sense all right well snl but part of the game you move on um i'll put tomorrow's in the description and you can play ahead and uh i'm
