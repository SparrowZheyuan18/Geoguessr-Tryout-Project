then because I'm just wondering here we go question wish what a Mara I'm gonna get in there and because I think Peruvian people in Bolivian I think there's lots of similarities around here so I'm just going to go near the pass and look for this quest you were malarkey because I'm really not sure at the moment whether we might be in Bolivia or Peru the reason being the flags are quite indecisive they're quite inconclusive rather now this question what is it let's have a look Joshua Aymara I don't know if I can really locate anything like that I can't really see you know forget if I get in on these regions I could be here all day so I think guys I'm gonna have another couple of looks at these flags which were there that's not great to be honest this just you think you would see the yellow but you can't see any yellow anything on here no San Benito it says there San Benito let me look on some of the other car see if I can see San Benito that says Betty warns there is some sort of some sort of race going on isn't it look that's another that surely got to be another bolivian flag there which i missed the first time okay let me have one more look we get in there guys we're getting there we are def o--'s get in there now we are looking we are looking at Northwest up there which to be quite honest doesn't really make sense because you're looking at big mountains over there so at the moment that really doesn't really add up and unless it's these mountains here I'm so I'm thinking to find in a different place to be honest possibly this one Cochabamba possibly we have a quick look for san benito even though that was only on a car and he could have come quite a lot from quite a way away from here yeah we could be looking at a few places here guys to be fair I'm also kind of keeping half an eye out for Akhilesh you are but I think it's futile I think I've got to make a guess now so is not to be here all day but I'm not gonna go for the powers I don't think no way it could be we know wait yeah we're probably looking at these ones here so we probably are in the pass actually okay right now don't suppose we can get the name of this road can way from okay I mean I'm thinking of this road here at the moment no that can't be right it's got to be heading it's got to be heading in this direction so we're talking somewhere over here maybe this one and that is if we are indeed in La Paz oh there's a river yeah there's a river my god how did I forget about that okay looking for a river there now all of a sudden here's one it's not a big one there that's the problem ah shoot I'm starting to question the whole la paz thing now I really am I really really am okay give me two minutes two minutes and have a look at a couple of other options that one it can't be no River it's got to be a big river remember or has it I don't know have a quick look at this one now that looks more like it does doesn't it but the bridge doesn't correlate doesn't correlate at all I'm gonna keep looking Tasi know about this one Terry huh bridge doesn't know it doesn't really correlate or unless we're here yeah we could be there essentially I'm doing it I was potosi why didn't I look why didn't i zoom in what the hell no way there's no bridge around there what the hell is all that about there is no bridge the rivers down please do not do that there is no bridge that's really confusing look where with the bridge be over that's so weird one night that is a very weird one huh okay well the good news is I got one hundred and forty seven point six miles so that ain't too shabby really if you zoom out that's pretty damn good and yeah among the people who actually successfully identified Bolivia with the flags I think I'll be up there really but I don't see how anyone would arrive at that because that bridge just well even on that road I find that really strange that is really strange unless the bridge was like really far away and I just totally

yet last round here and I still don't know whether we are on to beat my score I'm pretty short you know I'm pretty sure we are aren't we because yeah I think the last round in that game where I achieved that score was in Israel and I pretty sure it brought down the score 224 500 around that mark and the other one of course being the turkey one which I think was you know ten points off or something like that I can't quite remember but anyway might not matter because this is looking like a pretty pretty pretty hard round right surrender say which I believe exists in Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese rather we've got flashes of words on this sort of fading pasty sign here I think that's another say that looks like another renter great and then let let let Calais lo Calais probably means local I'm thinking Spanish out of the two so far which is bad really because that doesn't really narrow it down we look like we might have some possible Peruvian colors around lots of palm trees though so I'm thinking we might be a bit further north looks pretty damn tropical doesn't it to be honest I've been having Guatemala a hell of a lot especially on a diverse world I'm not so sure about an urban world you tell me matter if you're watching but you're very Guatemala heavy on you and you know it so yeah potential Peruvian colors there that is the Canadian Maple Leaf which is extremely confusing but I don't think we have any flags in this round let's look around look around yes yes it's tricky there's some decent cars here there's a bit of money little bit of money but this might be our best oh plus a Senshi ow it's looking like Spanish isn't it god I hope there's nothing on here that I'm missing out it looks like there's a website at the bottom but I don't think I can see any sort of dot BR or dot anything I think if I if I did say I could if I did try and and see something I'd probably just be imagining imagining it really so yeah we've got to make a decision here could it be Peru well where's the Sun it's worth looking at the Sun in this round I think I don't think we're getting much Sun each are we really is it over there setting I can't see any shadows so if there's no shadows there ain't a Sun really is there oh man even that billboards really faded and illegible unreadable okay well we've got to make a guess and I am deliberating over this because I think we can most definitely beat the record here I might go for Guatemala these yellow curbs that I know are crucial they're just going to be crucial on there but I don't know all these cars look like they're driving on the left at least have parked on the left it might be a one-way street to be fair doesn't look like there's any signs though to indicate that this car is completely in the middle as is this one down here well he's kind of know they're on the right aren't they they're on the right but why is everyone parking on the left down here I guess that's the best side to park just thinking out loud guys really and postponing my inevitable guess lots of yellows and blues around man this is tough could be Columbia Ecuador so many places but I am going to go for Guatemala because I have been getting it a few times disproportionate amount of times recently and that might just be luck but the main reason that I'm going for it is because it's a small area of land and if I am there then I might just beat the record somehow without getting one single perfect score that would be quite a feat so I'm going for Guatemala and I'm not going to go in this in the capital instead I'm gonna go here I think I just don't know ah the maps even playing up now on the regular gameplay for some reason oh dear okay it's okay let's go they're really not hopeful about this really expecting this to be in South America in fact looking at that surely the Sun has set over there she's slightly to the north hmm that is making me think twice you know the Sun does look like it's coming from over there doesn't it but it's setting so surely if it was setting it would be directly in the West man oh man I don't know what to do okay I'm going for it come on come on don't do this don't do this to me you can't you can't crash now oh my god could not contact the server to make guess try again jesus wept I mean would you believe it come on I know it's not Guatemala just put me out my misery Jesus Wiz I give up man I give up trying I'm just gonna sit here and chill and let the gods decide oh it's loaded my god we weren't in Guatemala but we're actually in Mexico not that far away in this place I'm not gonna be able to really am I this it's gonna let me zoom in yes it is coat Zak Holocaust okay so I'm still not going to be able to read it I've never heard of it but it's in a pretty mad part of Mexico down there in that bay that has to go down as a good guess all things considered although it was two nine nine miles away view summary two three three oh one that's got to go down as a pretty good game all in all I'm pretty pleased with that one that wasn't too bad lots of you will have worked out that that was indeed Switzerland though the Thailand one was I mean that was lucky I just went for Bangkok because it had that pretty big city vibe about it lots of expensive buildings built by the government the Newcastle one I'm really proud of obscure literacy knowledge they're saving the day even though I'm awful if I was to do a pub quiz books would be last on the list along with art Catania was you know what we all knew it was Catania all of us that saw that clue but still within the realms of that a good guess and then that last one has to go down as possibly the best guess really I mean lots of you I believe would have gone for Columbia Ecuador possibly even Peru because I mean it had that tropical vibe I think Columbia would have been a popular one Costa Rica but well done if he said in Mexico and well done if you got nearer than me and mainly speaking well done if you beat that score because that's a pretty that's that's a whopper so genuinely well done if you've beaten me today I want to hear a full account of how you did it all your methods your
