played gessa for a month so let's see how we go um I was going to do South America as I said I would do on South Saturdays um when I got back but I think that might be a bit too much of a challenge for me after not playing for a while so I thought why not play a nice gentle Saturday map that uh hopefully we can all fill much better about ourselves cuz we'll do well hopefully maybe so I chose a pinpoint a world hopefully this will go well nice gentle game get us back into it um and I will do a time Tuesday and I will try and upload something to coffee as well so thank you to those who have visited coffee um I haven't done very well with doing anything on it but hopefully I'll get better with that now um if you want to see some mediocre pictures of Japan then um I should be hopefully uploading those after I've Ed did them in a couple of weeks so check that out that won't be great but uh let's get on shall we that's what we're all here for so let's play a pinpoint world I got 24 to 40 last time so it' be nice if I got a perfect score that will help me get back into the swing of things right let set it as a challenge no time limit moving panning zooming all allowed for nice gentle easy game hopefully I get this out this evening let's invite you guys link is in the description below if you would like to play along and let's go do I know how to play anymore right it's not my glasses okay it is blurry okay pinpoint world how what don't know don't know it that's a good start isn't it unless it's monoco or something I don't think it is is it no can't be how you play you yeah I don't know any of this meta stuff so I don't know what this means I'm sure it means something to somebody uh where is the Sun so the sun is in the Northeast so that's possibly southern hemisphere but all right come on let's move move it a shy footage what does that mean what we got here so French so are we oh maybe one of the French islands maybe one of the French islands or some place in Africa um right I'm probably going to speed this up I'm going to try and get down this hill I know you can do something with space bar but um I'm not going to risk it while I don't know what I'm doing again it's like starting from here anyway uh see you in a [Music] bit okay this is this is really annoying all right so I've got down the hill and of course the blur is is not helping me at all it's um annoying me if anything um I'm sure these taxis mean something is that the G name flag I speak French and Gana H I should know things like this I mean come on is so flag we C the probably there why is it pinpoint don't go backwards oh oh this is a good start stressing me out it's supposed to be a nice gentle G nice gentle game I have lost all my confidence in this game so this is brilliant isn't it right I am just going to go I just don't know if they speak French in GH I don't think it's sier Leon um where else do they speak French senagal don't know what the sagales flag looks like is it D car that has a bay it does have a bay and it is very French it used to be a different car didn't it for no it was cracks in the footage was it oh God it's been a long time these birds are cool um right [Music] uh I'm going to go this is going to be wrong I'm going to go C and I'm going to go over here somewhere none of this look right but I'm going to do it anyway I'm going to go here first right bloody was de car it was right on the tip oh my Lord I should a should have trusted myself well I shouldn't have done because I trusted my first incident and went to the wrong place so that's good right okay good start okay hello I was just here right we are in Japan don't recognize those names and um so what else have we got going on so the beach sheu um there is a beach there's lots of beaches Japan we got some Road numbers but I don't think they're big road numbers oh look at this huh should Su SE Park huh well what you know so I'm guessing this is the sea to the Northeast um let's go back to those Road numbers shetu Sea Park hopefully that's easy to spot what else we got going on here a too namuru never heard of them and 244 okay so see is to the Northeast so do you think we're around here somewhere there jet TSU okay I found the 272 there's the 274 here's shetu right so where's shetu SE Park science center community store okay we don't need to find that cuz we've got a nice road sign here so we're going north on the 244 I presume and then the 272 comes off so we're probably around here somewhere 244 272 not another Junction is there 272 244 quite separate yeah so two4 272 to NAA she bet to we've got to be along here then so any there is a garage garage that's probably the garage so I think we might be here oo that'll be nice weeb in me is screaming that yes I'm going to Japanese round spot on uh we're in Hokkaido by the way finally found it scanning around everywhere from uh bottom to top should have started at the top okay let's try it yes cool that is amazing okay good now I feel better now I feel much better okay Golden Beach Golden Gold Coast Hotel Hong Kong Gold Coast dolphin Square so I presume we're in Hong Kong where am I going wow okay so Golden Coast um it's all so packed in here isn't it hoping it might be one of the big ones right so Gold Beach Gold Coast Hotel Gold Coast dolphin Square what else we got here Castle Peak Road Castle Peak Bay there a castle can't see one uh okay so much just hoping it would just jump out at me that's not how it goes is it uh so Castle Pete row Castle Peete Bay Gold Coast Gold Beach and a dolphin Center so it's nice when it's near the sea CU it's a lot easier you just go around the edge excuse me okay I am going to go around the edge and try and find this gold stuff or a Castle Peak Road see you in a [Music] bit Hong Kong Gold Coast is this it I can't see Castle Peak Bay oh Castle Peak Bay right there okay Castle Peak Bay Castle Peak Road Castle Peak Bay okay here we

line up with anything [Music] here I just just looking in other cities and I just went to this one I see here Walton service Point could it be here could we be here in tan gate g t girl I mean there's that is it worth the r well I'm not going to get a perfect score obviously is it worth the risk is this pinpoint it's not really pinpoint world it is it what am I missing but if it's not then I don't know I don't know where I've not found anything else um haven't looked in here it's got to be I'm not going to do like I did on the first round I reckon it's got to be here it's got to be here I'm just going to plunk it I think sorry to this point you had any kind of P hopes for me I am going to put it here it's probably a bad idea probably too far out but that's what I'm going to do so let that was another place why is this pinpoint how is it pinpoint did water have nothing to do with it y nothing at all i h no idea okay well let's see and that's okay that's not what I was hoping for but it's okay so I'm not discouraged I will continue to play Geo guesser um maybe practice a bit I don't know probably not don't tend to do that just play on camera well let me know how you guys did in the comments below what did I miss on the rounds where I just did not do well um what have I forgotten about playing G I guess that I need to remember um yeah thank you very much for watching I

"foreign welcome back to a random I don't know soothy Saturdays whatever we're going to call these welcome hello uh I've done my exam so finally I can chill out no more studying no more revision unless I don't pass of course I'm gonna steal it again but we're not gonna think about that so nice gentle smooth Saturday it's miserable weather there's a storm coming it's pride in Brighton but I don't think I'm gonna go out today first time I'm gonna miss the parade I think but um yeah it's gonna be too windy and yeah so that's my excuse Stick it to it anyway so we have a new whack map by EC hi easy thank you very much for making these Maps um the last one was really fun the trouble was I forgot to record the screen we didn't get to see it but at this time I have double checked I'm going to double check again I am definitely recording and I'm recording the screen so we are all we're all good to go so let's have a lovely chilled out game of British whack map so this one's slightly different so it's just in the UK opportune or British Isles um let's see what weird things we get this time so you do need a script installed the instructions are on the link here it's very easy to install especially if you've done the satellite maps and installed that script it's the same sort of thing so easy to install he's done a little video of how to do it and everything so well any further Ado as the people say let's just play this map so let's set it as a challenge no time limit panning Etc um I forgot to charge up my battery so hopefully this will last for the map come to that if it needs to be so invite you guys link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's see what we get right polish Airman Memorial cross is that supposed to come up I don't remember those kind of things coming up before so maybe that's a change for this one so here we go in memory of can't really read that so this is a bit sad um well really sad so it's a Polish Memorial in imagine adversity but I don't know there's a RAF plain I don't know much about War stuff so let's look forward and now there is some kind of gantry like a viewing platform so I've got six fade on these Maps you can't move like you would normally it takes you through a story using these buttons here so um let's see and this has taken quite a lot of leap forwards to try and find anything that I can go on welcome to Boston Park farm right that might be helpful animal Trail so Boston Park from public footpath through the land nice big ah someone getting annoyed with dog walkers so right okay let's try um I can't remember where Boston is there is a Boston in the UK where is it up near Scotland uh cannot remember it down here somewhere there's definitely a Boston in the UK I've seen it here we go there it is so could we be around here there's a marsh it did look a bit more she didn't it um so the other clue was Boston Park Farm let's see if we get anything else if we just look forward a bit more okay I kind of wish I hadn't gone that far because that really gives us a lot of information I think I was close anyway right Robin Hood Yorkshire Wildlife Park no I don't think I was as close as I would like to think I was so a614 [Music] Robin Hood Airport got to be up do you know what I'm gonna go for it anyway they're very numbers here one three nine seven let's see one three nine seven I think we are around here somewhere on three nine seven what we got over here I'm gonna go for it this is the only World War thing I can see so I'm gonna go here let's just do it let's just do it come on right there's Boston part Farm there's a Polish Airman Memorial cross right cool uh maybe I should have taken more notice of that sign than I did but never mind that's just like move on move on this is a gentle fun game right here we go for a quintessential British fate I guess it looks like a summer fate going on um I don't know what that is they all look like they're dressed for Cricket to be honest there's some kind of gardens the poison garden which doesn't sound fun while you're queuing up for that um yeah it's a nice walled Gardens let's see and what else oh look at that that's nice oh I want to go in there oh that's that's like a that's like a it's really thrown me off that's an amazing treehouse so the Woodland walk okay that doesn't really give me anything I mean it's quite a big car park so it's got to be it doesn't look like National trash signage but doesn't mean it isn't oh wow is this up in the up in the treehouse stuff huh this is like a Center box or something this is really cool look at it it's amazing okay next War Memorial there's like a Nelson's column kind of thing going on there very nice little village I guess Bond gate without right A6 does that mean like a parking restriction Zone oh there's some there's some signs down there very small Village what we got here so Bamberg Fenwick all with garden and castle dance okay this is easy to see A1 north north south and South barter books second hand Bookshop House of Hardy bailiff gate Museum okay I can work it I can read even if it's cut in half that was like one of the Brighton buses uh I can't see that okay I might try from here might try from here and see so we've got the A1 just down the road there North and South so A1 those didn't work there's ulmwick there's all Wick Castle uh uh that's the name that we saw on this one here right now I do it Bridge yeah there's a bailiff gate Museum I wanna like Castle oh like Abby house ruins of the hospital Malcolm cross where'd we start was it it's got to be in here right so there's a massive car parks complex of gardens with the Treehouse Cafe there we go where's the poison garden sounds so weird um okay I think go here I don't know let's just go for it got to be here because I guess how do you know that's where the poison Gardens are that how do you know no okay carrying on before the battery runs out smallest house in Great Britain which is in Wales um but I can't remember what town this is [Music] Dhaka I can't read it from the so we're on the coast this is official footage so we can trust the compass it's a lovely Castle up there so this is more of a bay with the Bay Area so North East okay let's go forward Conway okay sometimes that's how you pronounce it but that's the place it's definitely a place I know [Music] it's banger there it is Conway right so it's right on the front of the smallest house in Great Britain lovely done so that's one perfect score I think that's probably going to be my only one but let's see and don't don't like like Windermere or something like that the water head in uh a picnic Lakes yep got it it's a lake hello um yeah I reckon this has got to be that looks like where uh swallows and Amazon could have could have been swallows and Amazon isn't it sorry my age a bit there I think right let's move on I can't remember if it was Windermere that they were on but it's that area I'm sure there's a like a if they call it a steamboat with the yeah you know you know what I'm trying to say amble side Pier what do you call the type of boat it's a herbal side Pier good information Windermere ha ha Okay a591 so now where are those Lakes up here we go so Windermere over here we go Anvil side is here water heads was what was that was called we were in front there if we go back to the beginning I don't think it matters we were in front of the water head in weren't we so I reckon we were sir let's give it a go uh I lost two points okay maybe I should have tried to be more we're outside the toilet course okay last round battery's still green so we're good what is going on here what is this locations is this is cool okay um right not official footage so I don't know if we can trust the compass um what are we what are you guys doing um trying to think if I can see anything I recognize that is that a race course so horse racing course Maybe okay that's interesting then all right um it kind of looks like an island but I don't know if it is what else can we see Island over there okay let's go forward and see what's happening horses yes the Jersey race club we are on Jersey should have thought about that right we're down here okay Race Course only over here World War II Naval Tower not uh so I'm trying to see race club here we are so we must have been just over these medieval Fortress ruins nice the back yeah right on the right on the ruins I reckon cool I've been to Guernsey I haven't ever been to Jersey maybe I should go check it out all right last one and that's gone to Orange fabulous so we are all good what was our final result 21 322 I will take that that's not bad another fun map I really like this idea this concept I think it's nice to sort of like you don't get to choose what the clues are going to be so I find it interesting hopefully you guys found it fun let me know your thoughts in the comments below uh what score did you get and how many clicks did you have to go through do you you said right no this is finally the information I need to find this place um yeah that'll really enjoyed that thanks easy great um I am definitely gonna get some more stuff uploaded onto coffee this weekend I did underestimate how much Panic revision and studying I'll be doing during my time off to get some stuff done but I want to get that done this weekend I start a new job on Monday full time again so I want to make sure I'm not behind before I lose time to be able to do stuff enough of that rubbish thank you very much for watching and I will

welcome back to another geogassa play along I've got some time off work so I thought I'll get some filming done catch up on a few bits like that you know the important things um it's been a while since I've done a casual laid-back filming Geo guess a play along somebody suggested I play a community world so I thought that might be a nice one to do a laid back geographer I don't know I can't it doesn't quite go as well as time Tuesdays that sounds so much better than just random chilled out too I guess anyway stop nattering um so yeah so we're gonna play a community world um and we are gonna do it without any limits or you can move we could take as much time as we like um they suggested playing it no moving I think they said to me but um I don't I want a nice holiday game of Geo guesser which means it's gonna take as long as it takes which could feel well anyway I'll invite you guys link will be in the description below if you want to play along I would pause this video play the game and then come back or do it round by round and watch where I go terribly wrong after you've managed to get a perfect score all right good okay now let's go link is below all right let's just get on with this okay so where are we it's been a long time since I've done a world map I've got a bit too comfortable in the UK um so let's see what we got here Diggy Louie okay I don't know see we've got a European plates so yeah um wow I am so out of touch with uh Geo guesser in the Big Wheel World Wide World okay here we go so we're leaving horgesti um and that that maybe like Mania oh I definitely in Europe so terrible with what this might take a very long time okay so I am gonna look down our number or something and I will speed it up so you don't assumed it or entering the Lenny okay I was hoping for right now isn't that the Romanian flag colors so it was Rainier a good guess [Music] okay so I am losing the will to live trying to find this place so I think I'm just gonna plunk it but um just don't know no it's definitely it's got a very Romania I just don't know whereabouts in Romania and I haven't happened upon it I'm sure if I carried on looking I would maybe because I'm in the right country right so I'm gonna I thought it was around here maybe but that's not the school whatever it was uh I think I still might plunk it around here there's plunket here let's see oh not bad there's whole guesty there's that Lake I thought it was just a square but it's just very straight on that first part all right well I could have probably seen that if I tried a bit harder I reckon okay that was only the first round let's get on with this Hotel California what why did we even start sun is just right above us I don't want looking down there I think I shouldn't see if it was a official coverage which it probably is sun right above us right pretty much oh gosh this is where it's meta would be useful like this car the road markings the color of the sand but uh I don't know any of that stuff so I'm gonna hope that there's something down the end of this road South Africa or Australia see any details of the number of paint hmm they're driving on the left [Music] okay I'm not going anywhere I am gonna just do a bit of Australia um it could be Kenya I'm gonna go Australia I'm gonna regret it but I'm gonna go to any Springs um or sorry guys now I'm gonna go just outside out of Springs let's see yeah oh it was Australia okay that's so bad then uh and we're actually north what just in Australia huh Northwestern oh there you go we're right in the middle of nowhere Great Northern Highway how long might have got to the base eventually but okay I'm gonna take it I'm not too mad at myself for that I got the right country at least so I'm taking that as a win a bit of a cop out just plunking it in our Springs but I'm not very good if you haven't worked that out already all right let's carry on okay another middle and nowhere actually my first thought was India but I don't know can we get anything from the scooter but really you're going somewhere aren't you mate so let's see drawing out over here probably and it's more mountainous isn't it tell me uh okay I'm gonna go I'm gonna need the board with the Botswana because I'm not sure Let's Go Terra Firma that sounds cool let's do that okay yeah so Brazil ah I should have gone South America never mind next one okay we've got a ship one thing settlement cheapest neck settlement sound a bit Afrikaans I think so driving on the left trying to get in I don't see anything from that number plate I'm gonna go this way though I've seen another sign up here oh footage has changed um look at that truck shouldn't I but we've just got here let's say Dundee yeah Dundee r33 so I got I'm sure they have arrows here right yeah r33 Dundee right and the r33 set Pride um so I'm gonna try and find that now I've got to be around here somewhere right in theory okay I saw this sign fry held 10 miles which is here on the I'll say through this is that's the R34 and the r33 again but here it's the r33 and then I'm so confused but I think I'm just gonna forget that I spent so long on this now I'm just gonna flunk it here Funk it here and see where we are set up I see how 33 starts again what what okay well not bad lucky with the signs but not bad I think sorry about all the noises of bikes and stuff if you can hear that I know they sound much louder somehow on the microphone just really annoying I'm sorry anyway last round what do we got here some something the cats want to go out the hook this still all right bikes go away um so are we in Holland three miles away but we can't go that way let's go down here thank you see myself the folders but I don't know I do not know so I think look for similar Clues with the the best thing to do a plonk it there though [Music] okay I've not found it but I feel like we're here somewhere I don't really know why I found loads of signs I don't know where these places are I feel like I'm letting my mum down I should know a bit more about what in this but I can't I can't find it so I am going to plunk it here it feels like it's here I feel like I should be able to see it but um I can't so I'm just gonna plunk it and hope for the best let's see I was down there ah I looked down there for a second distalberg where's all the other names I saw uh Ford June okay well maybe I should do a hollow map I'm really upset myself still not bad score right country all good okay final 16979 I am sure you guys beat me I really hope you did if I got South America I would have would have been a bit better I don't think that's too bad considering I've just been doing UK maps for the last I don't know what six months or something so yay let's go yay well let me know how you did in the comments below let me know if you decided to do it no moving I don't know how you would I I would not attempt that myself so well done to you if you did uh so let me know how you did on that regard uh thank you for watching and I will see you in the next one which should be a time Tuesday oh bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 46.4441799534894, "lng": 27.0778112698121},

welcome back to a random Saturday do you guys play along uh so earlier today I filmed this player log of uh whack map which is really good fun it's a very silly strange game you have to download and install the script which if you've already done the unity one you'll know how to do it's very easy um the thing is I didn't check that I was recording my screen so I recorded a very lovely black screen which not ideal for this type of content um and unfortunately there's only 11 locations I was gonna do it again but I started and I got the same rounds so that's that's no fun that is no fun but what I will do is put a link in the description for the play along I did earlier today so you can play the map which I think you should it's fun it's great you should just put it it's interesting um what I should explain so you you can't move there's two buttons that you can press in the top corner and it will take you to the next point that the person who made that map uh thinks you should go for clues or interesting things it's yeah yeah play it it's good fun really good fun so thank you very much to EC for suggesting this map and for creating it I will see if I can think of anything fun to make my own version to add to your script um but as they say all that being said let's play another game because I really want to get a random video out it's not the right time of day to film the sun's on all strange places the Boy races are out it's good fun so what caught my eye down here was world without South America South America usually trips me up so this sounded like a great game to play so let's do this map instead um we've got a million plus locations some people have taken up a fair whack of time to complete it it's a chilled gentle game of Geo guesser so let's play this map let's set it as a challenge no limits let's enjoy it invite you guys this link could be in the description below as well I'll put it as the first one though and uh let's see world without South America should I double check that we're recording and yes we are good okay let's see it feels like Europe I know I should know Bollard law but I don't so I'm sorry what here top Commerce Scandinavian Maybe um yeah Scandinavia is very long straight Road yeah what else we got going on blurs some reindeer and a steam train awesome [Music] there's a web address there can I can I spy it I are hungry right weird oh I don't know now I don't know seems a long way to go it doesn't seem too bad I'll probably speed this up I'm gonna go to the end of the road [Music] I got to the end of the road there's a few signs still very Scandinavian to me so I'm really not sure now Where We Are familiar I don't know oh I'm glad this is just a gentle game hu yeah it is h u so it's hungry right okay well it was some information here what's this melody eye value and this is the place back this place is what I'm looking for okay hungry we go and I will speed this up see you in a bit [Music] I went all the way through the town and found this side so we were on this road there was a bus stop and we headed this way to get there Casper which was on that sign so maybe we're on this road there's a bus stop here what do the bus stop say see if we can do this oh maybe I'll speed this back up again either here or up here not there those roads there no roads here I think we might be on that one I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna go for this one so there's buildings there and there isn't I'm gonna do it let's go before someone further down 4997 okay that'll do oh let's go and next one um Americas North America's because there's no South America in this one is that a USA flag it is slow rain way doki no rain why we've got a highway I guess that means Indigo Court that's also another size [Music] see lovely turtle going under the road that's probably a good thing let's see what this site says nothing literally nothing evil horse man Road okay see what this one is it just a destruction rest area Maryland Welcome Center right half mile Maryland Welcome Center now that's over this way somewhere right very early and so yeah Pennsylvania probably close by so I doubt Maryland Welcome Center or jump how I mean I need to find out what road this is don't I [Music] Creek this is quite a long border isn't it it underestimated quite heavily I will speed this up and I will see you in a bit okay I think I'll give up on this one I found lots of signs but nothing I can find on the map something about Columbia uh row 216 is what we're on I can't find that uh Laurel Fort Meade Columbia oh I was just about to give up where's the 21610 oh [Music] okay that is it I do I do yeah I'm stopping I've been so long on this one stop looking oh I feel like we're around here somewhere uh so I'm gonna plunk us here okay yeah let's see let's just do it further up here there's vulma Hassan Road throughout the night five not the two one six oh these Rose always gets me in these roads all right that was only round two not bad on points right let's do this one quicker so we are Malaysia the Malaysian flag the influx terrible um idea I did I like film the leg with the blank screen as well today so that would be fun for the next League video enjoy that are we Jehovah I don't know that's a town name jail garage foreign owl I reckon we can find something from here right it was a Malaysian flag wasn't it so there's Johor there's Johor the whole Barrow okay so it's on the border with Singapore Jalan yeah yeah should I be looking for Johor Daryl something um [Music] it's gonna be in here somewhere could be take a while or I will just say this is close enough challenge yeah yeah oh okay I'm gonna have a quick scan around you never know I'll see you in a bit um uh yeah come on come on me just Punk it yeah it's got plunket there battery is going to run out if I'm not careful okay four nine eight five I will take it it was all the way down here thought I should look at this but I didn't never mind still got a decent score I will take it let's move on I should move my mic so I can see the buttons oh not America again Tina Hicks for catty catty city council catty City Council would be catty City Council would be all right um I never know which way to go I'm gonna go this way catty City tickets or I thought there might be something here Houston Texas I was thinking Texas but I don't know so that's right and that truck could have come from anywhere well Texas I guess that's the speed limit of sign signs just someone's name that's a number uh I don't know if I'm gonna find anything desirable so there's a lot you got any pointers Lone Star could this be I reckon it's probably Texas isn't it right okay catty let's see if I can find catty in Texas oh gosh I mean it's a huge state do I plunk it oh catty maybe I do find catty in Texas what okay and then what what's with more words coin likes right yes where do we start Ed here facing North Pine Lakes is there so I think that'll do yeah nice all right last round okay typical last round sun is in the North all right I'd say North what VH okay I'm gonna wander down both ways of the road and see if I can find anything otherwise I'm just gonna plunk it in Australia to be honest let's see you never know in the road okay nothing nothing is it at the end of the road apart from the spooky building lots of fences so I am going to go to Outback I guess I mean what else can I go this is a thing here no still nothing but Bush so it's got to be Australia right let's check this one again sun is north right it's gonna come on it's Gotta Be so let's go I reckon we're probably out this way somewhere in a small Road to pick that one let's do it let's see maybe that's the right hemisphere home of the wild peppers okey-doke well it was South Africa never mind that was still fun um let's see what that's respectable 19982 that's respectable okay I'm gonna go I'm gonna hope that this recorded well so I can get this out for Saturday I'm really hot now it's too hot nowadays let me know how you guys did did you play the whack map as well and did you enjoy it because I thought it was a lot of fun um yeah let me know in the comments below and I will see you on Tuesday for the standard geoguessa time Tuesday play along of train stations and we are on E I think so I will see you then bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

welcome back to another Geo guesser play along I have done another video so this is going so well so far this year um but I thought no timed rounds I'm still a bit shaky I'm playing cheer guesser let's do City guesser but I found the city guesser Europe map which I thought would be easier Maybe not many people have played it so hopefully it's a good map but um I guess we'll find out won't we so let's just dive into this said it as a challenge no limits on this game let's just have a nice casual chilled out game and uh invite you guys link is in the description below let's start the game right we're in France where in front so this is the thing I've got a name uh this must be Paris five whatever they call their areas right let's have a look there he is five I don't know what that stands for can you let me know in in the comments a r r let's call it area for now uh fist Fists why can't I see the fit seventh eight it's fifteenth eleventh seventeenths [Music] um cool this is going well um third oh come on I thought we would be faster than this here we go Saint jacks very good pronunciation there sent Jacks I should check out the compass should know include I can I can unlock it there so we don't lose Where We Are step out here so this road is going northish or maybe one of these is it all one way yes going down yes not that one though okay if this takes me much longer I will probably speed it up I feel like we're close I found it finally right we are in Paris so Rose De somerad that's the road we're on Wang Chinese restaurant Maybe Hello Kitty jewelry store there anymore oh that would be cool that would be cool anyway I'm gonna throw over this side hold on so bad with I say Japanese French so that's that store there so we I must actually be on this all right wait that doesn't work is it hang on I really needed to get better at you I guess we're again so we're going west to reach this road so yeah we must be on this road oh there we go there's campus store here okay let's put it down let's just go for it it's got to be there yes I could start could start let's try the next one right we are in the UK we are in London ec4 so what's this building seahorse house right and this and Paul's Cathedral I'm not gonna get closer to that probably mention house Millennium Bridge so Friday Street in the city mansion house station is duh because maybe we should probably get a bigger a bigger Road name I don't know like there's Friday Street um we here Boston Ivy is that what it is now so seahorse Pub it's on here oh here we go so we are down here where did we start exactly all right on the junction Friday Street so here here see the maps I don't know all right police public cool post no unless it's that thing never seen anything like that before all right let's do that this is quicker good good good lucky London that doesn't normally happen right next one we are in Greece Athens flea market right it's a nice official coverage see if I can do this one no moving I don't know Athens very well though let's see our thumbs it's quite big isn't it since flea market do you think it will be listed I'm probably gonna have to move on I um do nope it might be written in Greek in which case I have no chance I'll probably speed this up but I'm going to try and find the flea market without moving but I will move if I need to and I'll see you in a bit okay I think I found it finally so I had to move one move um I was looking for attico and I found a place called attico but that's not it luckily I moved to see the actual station name is this one here so we have got the station behind us few in the square in the Northeast so I think we've got to be around here let's just double check where we started probably around here maybe that's the road how many classes around let us see we've got 360 Degrees yep okay in this building all right let's do it and that took far too long trying to be stubborn and not move but I did I got the full jaw nice right only the fourth round okay good well done me getting through it Tasker audacity a villafranca that dot PT um so we in Portugal let's have a look up here it's Museum so I've just did some freedom interesting um see what's this Lisbon cool so we are on Portugal is the government building no it's been approval by the government well done so we've got the C down there let's have a look at this stop here and we get limoiro I am doing great with the languages sounding very British DeFranco in it right look at this over here the big old church on a hill with a tram line hopefully is on the maps um these are the names of the places right Lisbon we've been mostly Capital Cities so far aren't we uh miradoro [Music] um there's so many Hills as far as I remember a door here we go um the S George a lot more maradoro uh to S George lots of trousers oh look cool let's go to S George right um Museum that's not really sure which road we're on it's like a Sarah minute is this stop called um I'm not gonna be able to see that I think I go downhill and I'll go to Center Antonio let's try that so on a road as a tram um around this Castle um okay I think I will speed this up while I pinpoint this down hopefully tuna I'll see you in a bit I found it I've been looking around this area for ages going it seems like it's here must be here and then I forgot to look for the restaurant she's right there on the map so we're right outside on this Junction [Music] so let's say about here that took me far too long as well right let's go excuse me good okay last round hopefully I can do this one quicker is it going to be another capital city let us see where some small uh Triumph's not in use Maybe what we got here oh are we back in um it's worth Grease or are we elsewhere Rose of Bulgaria we are in Bulgaria so are we in Sofia gone around the Bulgaria that much I think there's a flag um let's see if we can get over to this building here hmm I mean that looks like a city hall or something doesn't it McDonald's so we got [Music] um Live Well feel well have fun well okay let's see if we can find these Road names and a McDonald's I'm gonna guess Sofia um again quite a big city what they've got trams okay it's looking good McDonald's is that gonna be there's probably more than one McDonald's right is that it talk show a bit about what's the name of this road in English please I'm sorry I don't know oh I'm going to be this one is that still for Tosha yeah it is okay I think this is that big building we can see across the road there's that McDonald look okay where did we start though just uh uh Rose of Bulgaria just here I think it's Bulgaria on there no I think here 's that one yeah I think here let's see last round doesn't disappoint fantastic oh cow's a bit far but we were lucky on the points there hmm that was good all right let's see full score good all right I am happy with that back with a full score ah yeah all capital cities so I guess this should be Capital City yes Maybe you did in the comments below um there will be a time Tuesday coming up and maybe Urban World Urban guesser next Saturday and then I might try and do um maybe I will try and do some harder Maps after that but we'll see just getting back into it but uh thank you very much for watching and I will see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 48.85013198852539,

welcome back to another Geo guesser play along and yes I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do the guitar up um apparently it's very hard and yeah I don't think we're gonna do very well [Music] okay oh this is not a good idea let's give it a go I will set it as a challenge invite you guys link will be in the description box below and let's see if I can do okay as good as England let me know if you're watching the World Cup and who you're supporting um right okay well there's oh Stadium stuff this is not going to go I'm quite tired so Lucile South Doha but I'm presuming most of footage is going to be in and around Doha anyway but you never know Exit 23 do we know I guess is it is the road number let's go back see this one gives us a number no just the Metro stations over there okay um what was that we start loose sales central you lose Souls South and we're going in the South Direction all right loose cycle yes so Doha is to the South so maybe we're up here somewhere Lucile here's Lucile there's a stadium okay Exit 23 do you think we're on this road there's Exit 23 there's Metro do you think we're just here it's like right next to Stadium it's plunk is there around it can't be this easy oh just open my eyes and see a stadium right there so yeah we must be I hear a big circular Stadium um so we are heading south so we're on this side and maybe here or on the off-ramp probably on the off ramp aren't we let's see how accurate this is nobody here okay let's see we're right on that let's see let's give it a try come on oh ah oh come on I would expect four points for that but never mind okay I'm a bit more encouraged now maybe it's not going to be that bad as long as there's lots of science and they also have a English alongside all right let's try the next one uh I'll just draw residents too some partly built hotels maybe or something is this gonna be a stadium or no buildings obviously buildings wow um some housing I guess so let's say work in progress sorry for inconvenience that's okay right big long road lots of big little rows I'm sure let's just quickly see this sign down here Al Faris resident building thank you no well there's a roundabout down here maybe or an exit or something let's see what that says huh there's some shops Burger Hut a big old van excuse me right hmm oh mirrors up like a shopping center perhaps here's some streets sweet two one six and two one eight and I don't know what the 69 is in the corner um right again I'm gonna go Doha and the streets have numbers and names or I don't know how it works so it looks like it's mostly names on here I don't know what the 69 is about it says number 65. don't know why though so look I can see anything else of you I mean I think more street signs I don't know is that the city over there or we just slap bang in the middle of it um okay let's say there's lots of buildings over here let's have a quick look at another Stadium because I presume there's going to be lots of stadiums around obviously Prime retail space okay let's put that here um and I'm just gonna look I will speed it up Don't worry um but we've got that number Street 266. that's not how the numbering system works hopefully not too bad um it says you're number nine some of it so there's obviously a lot of new stadiums around so maybe I'll do that and see yes okay I'm gonna just scan around and see what I can find and I will see you in a bit hang on so I saw this I moved a bit and I saw this Stadium which is the same one we saw at the beginning um so I started looking around that and where do we start so panic excited need to go back to those ride signs so there's a Almira Supermarket oh whatever is shopping center on a roundabout we came from our [Music] 218 it's got to be here that's the Fox Hills because I saw that on one of the apartments I'll just residence was that just oh it is it is and I spent far too long on that but it was worth it apparently all right why is my toolbar up let's go I got the full points right that was only round two oh I will not take so long in the next oh my God oh this is this is definitely harder than I thought because I really want to do well I'm just spending too long Two Notch on it right that was lucky because it was the same stadium let's see what we got here q and CC parking researchery Premiere in hotel and qncc so q and CC may be a conference center let's see what else is over here researchery platform two is that a metro stop might be a metro stop and we've got research restock okay researchery qncc weird building okay researchery and qncc okay we can find this one excuse me so that's what we're going to look for qncc and the Metro stop researchery yeah yeah I'll speed this up again I will not take as long I will see it up here okay I found Qatar National Convention Center which must be human CC right I can't find researchery um it could be the National Library I mean that's a researchery isn't it I don't know very loose but I can't I haven't found anything else um so I mean maybe it's this bus stops here I'm just gonna go here though um on this road here I don't know probably not I don't want to spend as long as I did on the last one this is qncc gate number seven qncc could be a cricket ground green9 trans Dot 25. I think it's got to be around here um research just oh here's a parking lot in his Education City oh this is the researchery I hear one of these roads let's pop us here let's pop us there let's see let's just go for it excuse me okay so not full points on that but close close so it was this research area there's no stop called researchery here okay next one next one let's see if we can do any better this is just a car park Education City Golf Club that's where we just were right Education City is here Education City Golf Club um can City now I'm just I must just be doing being blind right so there's plenty of parking spaces um he where's another car park that's probably a car apart sorry guys um right well that's a stadium let's put this here a minute okay so there's a stadium which is in the east so Crescent City FIFA we must be in car park oh no sorry East ER man you must be around here somewhere I can't see anything about golf club though that might just be a random sign so this is to the east the stadium all right so we've got a stadium and another building I think we might be in here somewhere so I'm just gonna go for that cool we were in there somewhere but somewhere too far somewhere too much further ah okay I'm confident we're definitely just in Doha on this map all right let's try the next one it's the last one I've seen these buildings in the last one as well there just seem to be in the same area so that's a bit disappointing really um all right siren go about your business right oh I want to go where do I want to go let's try and go over there slow creeping movements welcome d I don't want to go in here get out there's some signs down here cap on oh no over there we get in there we get in there one more okay so yep heading towards that same stadium again um missile North um exit but no number outside Plaza was that route 6 Maybe so back towards this Stadium um let's have a number this one doesn't Ireland there's that Island maybe we're here somewhere um so we're coming off to go see blue style South and outside Plaza um outside Plaza so that's further along let's see the Plaza style Plaza um so I think we must be further up here so it's just no I thought that might be like a Shopping Center or something there's another Almera um here Mario number six okay I will probably speed this up now because there's enough of me going here or maybe here is it here and that's nice uh so I'll see you in a bit okay I think we're here somewhere so we've got the soul University here which I can see just here um not really been able to match up anything else but gonna go for that because I think I think we are so where did we start further back this way right so not again at the beginning beginning please thank you um so yeah I'm gonna I'm just gonna go for here um a little bit further up there here let's see let us see oh that's not a bad plonk I was just giving up okay so what did we do in the end twenty three eight four three I'll take it not so bad oh and I think we're really lucky with the signs and the fact that we're in pretty much the same area most the time so it was recognizable which is helpful um but yeah no definitely surprising surprise myself hopefully you guys did well I'm sure some of you would have got perfect score on that one um but you know I really enjoyed that was good that was good fun let me know how you did in the comments below thank you very much for watching and I will see you in the next one thank you to those who um voted on the poll so looks like Tuesday's video will be train stations but not in the UK so stick around for that I'll see you on Tuesday bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 25.4222009106562, "lng": 51.485412471946546}, {"round": 2, "lat": 25.429439299983628, "lng": 51.50126771675827}, {"round": 3, "lat": 25.32050629138877, "lng": 51.425178333754914}, {"round": 4, "lat": 25.311754155938058, "lng": 51.4186802461259}, {"round": 5, "lat": 25.40617049421092, "lng": 51.51226296123529}], "images_path": "data/images_geocatto/0LoWjyBzTs4rdfZs"}

"foreign I found this map called amazing dragons which I thought sounded cool amazing statues and sculptures of dragons around the world here be dragons so I would sort of be a nice interesting map to play I see that uh that Dragon boys lived up to his name and he's done it one minute 24 seconds I was a very good score so I don't expect will be that good why not give it a try might be some cool statues to see so no limits on this one let's invite you guys link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's see what dragons we find sure this looks like the UK it's a cool looking dragon and we have some lovely road signs we are in Wales and and oh what do you want to go over there looks like a better one that's got a Motorway on it right this one's decent clears M4 and this one at the train station on it right it says station we have a look what the station name is that would make sense wouldn't it how far down here are we gonna go station now there's no sign for the station where should I go past it uh Town Center yeah which town center um definitely so stationed that way and Hospital well it keeps moving up there little Bridge Street like a county symbol I will have a look at that in a minute but I want to find this train station so cardigan Spillman Street hotels let's just use this shall we okay so please uh yes ones you were I didn't mean to pop my thing there um a4t a 40 is here this is [Music] Trend lentily I don't know don't know right so A40 um going towards it's quite early at the morning I shouldn't maybe have waited it's not working out to do this um card goes into the a484 a484 goes through this town there's a48 let's see cardigan down there and I can't wait what can I see okay I'll probably speed this up my eyes are clearly not open yet I can just find cardigan I think we will be near where we are so I'll see you in a bit okay okay went all the way along the a484 trying to find something then I obsessed with trying to find the station which was not as easy as I thought it should be I finally found it it's carmarthen station so we are in carmarthen so we are at a roundabout probably this one but let's see so go back out the station up into the bridge and down this road and then straight across up here I think it was n't it no obviously not okay uh there must be a road name around here somewhere here's one there we go oh no not in the car park oh come on why would you blur out the road name doesn't make any sense all right I can write this out come on so I came up the bridge we didn't go up that way so yeah it must be this one must be this roundabout there goes the bus stop switcher up there yeah okay so where did we this day could be far too long yeah I think that's right okay let's go for it God okay next one's gonna be better quicker yeah right we are in Europe there's a couple of dragons there's having more on the other end yeah a couple of lovely dragons right um so where are we don't really know the language Liana I can't say it properly um well I mean that castle I'll stick out and there's a funicular what is it me and my words today um so we are Slovenian and is there a castle this one or Bianca Grant yes okay this is where we are this is a road name there's a bridge okay here's the river um copiters ever hmm let's have a look what direction the road is going in okay so it kind of South definitely over a river right yeah there it was going east west so we must be around here somewhere oh I'm Bridge featuring famous tracker statues that would be the one that'll be the one right and we are my bridge okay yes like so that was much quicker foreign country then in Wales that's just great oh shiny okay being an Asia so we kept Municipal Health Center so we are in Phuket so um what what is this place maybe it's like a hotel I might just be a just display um do I try and find the medical center is that a road name okay let's have a look uh for cats I don't know where it is where is it I'm not great with Thailand so huh why is my might I keep putting my marker down accidentally is it an island oh it's embarrassing um so let's speed this up because this is embarrassing and I don't know where Phuket is and I will be back with hopefully some good news found it really well found it so I moved but I found figure obviously it's just never looked at it on a map before um and then I moved a bit further down the road and I saw this old Phuket town community sign so I found old Phuket town or something name here um and then when I looked at the river here is a hey hey Lang on Statue Golden Dragon so this must be I hope if you kept I Municipal Health Center so I don't know what the name on the front was hang on or something and Nano but here we are in front of this statue so I think that is a good place oh let's go okay good good good good definitely not doing it as quick as uh that Dragon Boy well done you let's see what we have next that's why it's gonna be a blank out oh no photosphere nice dragons Tower and a tiger Tower I guess the coder I think is it called I'm not sure right um this is gonna be not very easy so another Dragon over there um see if any of these buildings give us anything [Music] I mean that's an amazing building yeah wow but not of any help doesn't say Where We Are I can only guess we're in China I don't think we're in a theme park there is a lot to see here look over there is another large stature over here so there's kind of a city over there to the east there's a big lake or that goes out to the Sea um you get some coffee other than that I don't know I don't know so I am gonna go with I don't even know the compass is right I'm gonna go with that we are by the sea and the coast somewhere um obviously there's quite a lot of coast um we're gonna have a look around I think I'll speed it up I'll try not to be too long because I don't know how I'm going to pinpoint it unless it says to pagodas with a tiger and a dragon on it um I don't know how else I'm gonna get uh so I will see you thank you okay okay I don't know how I'm gonna find this place so I found this one here that has a lot of temples going on maybe and then across the way here there's another Pavilion maybe that's what we can see and I don't know I bet you it's not even on the coast so let's just plonk it there oh why does it keep moving right oh okay let's plunk it here and uh see how far away we really are it was Taiwan I was like there's not a lot of English so it can't be Taiwan but it was here it is dragon and tiger pick goaters okay well at least I've plunked it near type one apparently so not too bad on points I will take that on a China around I didn't even think to look at that never mind me swiftly on last round right oh God so we've got a sand dragon official coverage though okay under the road is it tremors we in America's with the yellow lines on the road oh I think we're gonna be able to read that I mean desert coverage I can't even tell what language that is my eyes are really bad but I don't know right oh there's another side not paying it come on uh Borrego Springs correction quotes that and uh right so we've got a road name what's this one say street signs that people live here for Rico Springs yield excuse me Okay so there's a sun oh yeah there you are right not really helpful I don't think kind of in this house yeah I think we're in America in the US of a h what is this I don't know so we must be somewhere down south I guess viriga Springs um I don't find anything down here I'll start looking at the map I don't think we're in Australia or anything of course there's no cars there's no life there's nothing happening um what's this new symbol set checkpoint what does that mean okay I don't know let's I went that way I don't think there's anything this way nothing as far as the eye can see there's some dinosaurs cool um more dinosaurs and some more wait a minute that size on that side of the road are we in Australia actually in Australia so annoying ah you know what does the crossroads tell us we go Springs yield of course that's on the left side so okay we're in Australia fine Big Horn Road 700 hang on we're not driving on there we are driving on the right we are right okay I am gonna look Bighorn Road Borrego Spring Road hasn't a big big horn is it um a land feature since why is it keep putting my marker down when I don't want it to all right I am going to look around here yeah it's a Bitcoin in New Mexico I'm gonna look around now I will be back with probably nothing I'll see you in a bit okay of course I can't find anything um I'm trying to also look for a road 700 because I thought maybe that's what that means on there but I just don't know um yeah I don't know so I'm gonna go for this deserty area here um there seems to be a fair amount of like Mountain big rock and stuff so maybe I'll put it on on there there's a Springs couple of Springs I don't know maybe it's not even in America but um that's where I'm gonna plunk it let's see let's see where we really were it's like should I go to California because that's bit me in the ass recently like no no I won't I've seen that I didn't need to zoom in that far to see that oh my God okay well at least I didn't go too far away from it now what is this that we're looking at serpent sculpture Borrego Springs serpent sculpture apparently there is a lot of stuff around here I just did the scene oh hell hole Palms new setup definitely so is there a mountain or a range called Bighorn am I just making that up is that just something I heard in a western let me know in the comments below all right so what was our final score twenty two one three zero I'd I think that's too bad not too bad at all obviously that one maybe I could have done better um and America I just I knew I should have gone California next time and it will be wrong then let me know how you did in the comments below I'm gonna put it up a poll for Tuesday's map so hopefully at least one of you might respond as to which one you want to play on Tuesday thank you very much for watching enjoy your weekend and I'll see you next time bye

"foreign something a little different this time um I've made my own map so as you might know I'm quite obsessed with Japan and there's a chain of pubs in Japan which are British themes so they're kind of like the wetherspoons of Japan if you will when I went there you can just spot them everywhere I guess because it's in English and there's always a Union Jack and stuff hanging about so um they're interesting places they're quite nice they are like typical British pubs I suppose um I mean if you go I'd recommend that these going once to a hub to to try it out I think I think I might be in twice but that's it but I thought uh it would make a good map nobody has made a map of it that I could find so I made one um some interesting things I was making you I realized you don't choose where the pin goes and sometimes it has a habit of going to a photosphere Point rather than the street view so hopefully all of the ones I've done um don't suddenly go to a a photo sphere instead of where it's supposed to be um it took a long time to make the map looking at the list of all the places on their website to try and find them on the map um but at least you can put in the address and it just goes straight to that point so it wasn't that bad hopefully I mean I've definitely forgotten where most of these are already so that shouldn't be a problem for me playing this um and one tip that they said on their website is that they almost always next to or near a station um so the one tip I guess for finding it is try and find the nearest station and you might find where it is most of them are in Tokyo so that's handy but there are a few outside of Tokyo um so yeah let's see how this goes how well can I play my own map and how well you guys do playing this map as well so I said it as a challenge no limits on it it's going to be a nice gentle fun game to play there is a cat sat next to me looking like she might jump over across a the desk just to warn you so the link will be in the description below if you would like to play along and please play along let me know if there's any issues with a map and and let's see if it worked my first map let's see if it's broken no good right so there's the Hub another thing I found making this it always seems to be a truck outside every single hub so I had to try and find different angles so you could see the signs okay so this one's definitely in Tokyo next to the body shop which is a British chain born in Brighton okay loved in Tokyo so that's where I'm from Brighton so that's interesting anyway right Neo Shibuya so we're in Shibuya there's another Hub there so this is the help prevalent these chains are so there's one here and then there's one across the street that's nuts another one all right um so Shibuya and it looks like we're in Center guy I think yeah so let's go Tokyo Shibuya [Music] down here Center guy is and here I've completely forgotten where Center guys around here isn't it this is Center guys on the map no I'm sure this is so yeah Center Street uh we were next to Neo see if it's on the map uh the marker here a minute um Okay so Lobby Shibuya that would probably be on the map which directions the station let's try and find Berkshire and McDonald's is probably a lot of McDonald's isn't there um come on let's be able to just spot it oh [Music] I thought it would be a lot easier than this but obviously I was wrong I'm not gonna say I need to do some better oh his his McDonald's should be a zero gate there's a hub which hub is that the right hub there's a McDonald's there so it must be right there's Lobby yeah I think we started up there didn't we by The Body Shop uh uh Hub should be your second shop oh I guess this one over here is a first shop okay let's try that there nice two yards okay that was a nice easy one for me hopefully you guys got that too okay where's the Hub does it moved oh there it is maybe the footage has changed already okay [Music] um big Street could be anywhere else we've got going on here karaoke and stuff this is a tube entrance oh just don't think that's the name of the tube is it oh I can't read that does that say Osaka Jr Jr soccer stadium all stuck up okay we're in Osaka a covered street but there's quite a lot of those covered shopping areas oh how do we find this um I think we've got to go by the train station so we need to find what the name of this train station is are they listed on the map so it says M1 M5 um see these metros it's got to be a Metro right no M1 m5s Okay so is that that can't be the name of the Wishy no more color maybe no more car is the name of the tube Subway something like let's can we go in here let's have a look let's go down into the subway oh there's doors oh who oh pretty cool okay oh yeah another shopping Street my friend who lives in oral soccer she said to me that in the summer it gets so hot it they spend most of the time down here in these underground streets because it's just too hot outside okay so exit thank you higashi chuo Dory here we go this should be what we can look for um I am probably going to speed this up and be looking for something some hanky some right that took me a bit of time I came out of the Subway because I just couldn't find this isn't it isn't it yes it is I couldn't find Hank you anywhere um so I came out and I thought look at the main road and then I saw a plaza you made a building I was like I've heard of you made a so there's you made her and then there's hanky department store is this the same it's probably not the same isn't it I ABC mark sandban guy where is this place so there's no advantage to making your own map and none at all those thank you thank you higashi so this is the right area okay here's some M's okay okay we're getting there look so if we go back no put a pin there so I don't lose it right back here and where was that you stop looks different no way M5 here M5 so is that across the road from where we were there's the karaoke where is the Hub sorry karaoke's there where do we start again here so the Hub was there the karaoke is over there right right very okay big Echo is on the same side as a hub right big Echo Hub big Echo Hub must be down here so we probably started here maybe happy pancake so a happy pancake happy pancake lovely all right that took oh there I am it's nice that took a long while uh cool I hope you guys uh getting there a bit quicker and better let's try the next one help basement always in the basement well not always but usually in the basement where they belong right where are we now this kind of reminds me of an area called Kanda but I've been to the Hub in Canada it doesn't look like this Trattoria looks like Italian uh what else do we have here are we even in Tokyo are we somewhere else yes Tokyo okay good sign so I guess there must be a train station along here somewhere uh so let's see Canary Steakhouse another quite famous chain stand up and eat your steak it's very strange that just an underpass or something where's this train station one give me some signs no whoop okay uh German beer oh we can't go any further no hi can we not can we please yes okay I've got to get to a train station so this is a Railway Bridge so must be a station and probably going past those assigns yes yes yes no yes no Imperial Tower so we near Imperial Palace Maybe maybe nothing train station wise Prada and Chanel William Posh part Imperial Hotel Imperial Plaza maybe I can find that in Ginza right Ginza uh Skins are down here somewhere in it there it is up okay so we're probably along there maybe oh that's a Metro where's the moon right around here maybe so can we find the Imperial Hotel ever along this line Imperial Plaza Imperial Hotel way down this way Imperial Hotel here we go so this is Palestine no I don't know where it is okay so that's the Imperial Hotel I guess we didn't go over to go under here do we oh it must be down here somewhere um of course maybe it's not listed on here okay I will probably speed this up if I haven't already let's pop a star a minute and I'll backtrack and find out where we went foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] so we were facing Southwest that's Trattoria ciao yeah there maybe let's try that 12 yards but still the Four Points okay good let's try the next one see there's always a um forgot the name of our flag uh right where are we can we go inside or no no we can't okay where are we we are on a big old Junction which is good there's a station yo Yogi yo Yogi so that's again in Tokyo yo Yogi is around here as your yogi park where's your Yogi station there it is so this must be The Junction we're at so Yogi's on the in the north east so we probably came from here maybe is that Christian face well it might be listed but not in English or her Maji excuse me is there a police station that'll be it I guess police books the Wendy's that one here but I think we were down here so Hub isn't on the map again let's go back to the beginning anything else here we can go by 7-Eleven foreign that's on the right side yeah Okay cool so I think we're here I think we've probably started there is that the road I'm a bit further up here right oh I don't know let's go for it should have should have get to where it is never mind good another one now I feel like I have got an advantage of making the map but it's because I know some of these areas no problems uh oh last round oh I'm having fun with this I miss Japan so much right okay ikibakuru okay and what is the Hub I didn't notice the Hub is that it no there it is basement of course of course okay so piano Lounge I don't know that's gonna be noticeable um Mr donut I think I should just use the uh Myriad of uh road signs here it would probably be the best thing okay so some Park Sunshine City I've been there so that's 430 meters it's quite far and then the station is that way go away and then the park so station is to the West which means that is to the East and getting my Northern east north and Easter I'm not getting it right okay let's go icky bakuru now let's see if I can remember where that is um do not remember so that's a good start uh it's all it was North but it's been a while here you go ikibakuru so there's the center so it's actually the main station which is here and we are East from the main station wrong way so there's a park [Music] um so there's a metro station could be near that oh how are we going to pinpoint this um [Music] what's the closest thing some Hall um is only a hundred yards and Naka ikabukuru Park so there's Sunshine City naka iku I can't talk anymore okay I am gonna speed this up I think I'll look for the park or the uh the hall the sunshine city is that way to the South okay that's good for Sunshine said you go here so maybe around here somewhere okay I will speed this up and look for these things that I just said that I've already forgotten the names of I'll see okay I was like I think I find it out I was so confused I finally went all the way down here and found the station which wasn't that far away so it took me ages to work out what road from the station we were at there's Parker I couldn't see that before I was obsessed with Cebu but I finally found it it's got this all this Wiggly green bit so this has got to be it here I think that's a nikinari steakhouse next door there's a canary Steakhouse Hub isn't listed again very useful so we started exactly here so let's pop this there and let's see two yards okay so oh God I got a new title and I got a perfect score on my own map that doesn't sound as impressive does it but I'm very happy that it all worked there was no weird footage no odd Photo Spheres which is great so yeah I think that went well I enjoyed it reminded me how much I missed Japan hopefully you guys did okay I think there was quite a lot of signage that was in um Aji so in English writing so hopefully you guys found these places if not close by so hopefully it's a good fun map for everybody to play but let me know how you got on in the comments below if anything broke as well let me know and uh thank you very much for playing and for watching and I will see you the next one bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 35.66072071312592, "lng": 139.6987510807408}, {"round": 2, "lat": 34.70240179417256, "lng": 135.5020452385384}, {"round": 3, "lat":

hello welcome back to another geographer play along today I thought I'd try something a little harder a bit more challenging this map I found all countries only one place in each country and the average score is just over 9 000 so not an easy map um but I will take it as a win if we get at least the right country maybe not pinpoint the exact location because I think some of these will be very difficult um yeah so it will be a win if we get in the right country and I will not try not to take too long on each round um just the right country so shall we see how hard this map is said it is a challenge the link will be in the description box below if you would like to play along and let's see how hard this is going to be right wish I knew polls I know some of you have told me about them but obviously hasn't gone in um where am I thinking like really sure because it's got the holy poles um it kind of looks like America but surely there would be yellow on the road wouldn't there it was America or Canada and some sheep all right cap this is not less than ideal excuse me excuse me oh right um maybe this is New Zealand I don't know so what's happened to that car what side of the road are we driving I need a road sign so we can see um I can't really tell from the car unless I'm missing it oh road sign or another car please come on I said I wasn't gonna spend too long on each round and there I am already mucking about oh gosh what a wonderful first round let's see come on come on something give me something there's nothing I'm gonna set the end of this road this road is quite long and two more clicks then I will just make a guess come on second click what's what's going on okay [Music] um so because I think oh it's my hair sorry I think some of those holy Telegraph polls are in Romania but it doesn't look like that to me but what do I know some horsey stuff over there there's sheep kind of looks like the UK but not I'm I might go in New Zealand Sun why aren't I looking at the sun it's in the east Sun there do you think yeah I don't think Sun's gonna help much there's another cat hmm okay no please I am gonna try New Zealand and I am going to go North Island and here I'm gonna go Stratford so this sounds look like the UK let's go there okay well it was New Zealand it was the wrong Island very you know very far from where I went okay right country so that's one yes let's see what we got next Okay so driving on the right I mean this looks European to me but it's our European badge on there I think so smooth this way I can't really tell if I'm thinking like Bulgaria that might not be right though it doesn't come up that one from each country so who knows let's see what this truck has to say let's see Mr truck definitely looks like EU plates on there hang Gardner never heard of them dot com okay not helpful No Country stickers on there are you in front Maybe oh I should learn bollards I should really learn about art foreign knowledge um know what's going on over road sign oh so maybe hungry or Romania I kind of remember which one has that kind of dictate texting on the top is Romania isn't it it's hungry of it as well not so much so I think we are in Romania so it's close to Bulgaria right so that was hmm so vanagus so I'm gonna have a quit well this is gonna be a small place isn't it let's have a quick scan for this place and if not I'm gonna plunk it okay quick scan around didn't see it can't say I was looking that hard to be honest um but I'm going to plunk it down here by Bulgaria um and I'm gonna go look at the V name here let's go here let's see let's see right country wrong country it was Lithuania I didn't even consider didn't even consider that I always forget about these countries uh okay one or one to the game one to me let's see what we get next okay so hello um this is a famous Temple or mosque oh good um no right not my strongest points um I don't know what country this would be in hoping for a flag but I don't think there's going to be a flag in here is there um can't tell from the bins he's like like sorry so maybe talking more Pakistan possibly can I see what you're looking at okay no I don't like this stuff looks like um right okay I am thinking foreign and my knowledge is not great um yeah so to use um Arabic so I think it's Bangladesh Sri Lanka I don't think yeah I think we might be Pakistan so there we go Islamabad I guess I mean I'm just gonna plonk it let's find a suitable location um there's a mosque here actually pop it there pop it there all right let's see the rack oh what was the name okay Al jilani wow oh okay okay so one out of three so far I hope you guys are doing better I haven't even looked at the score what have I got so far five and a half thousand okay maybe these last rounds will um give me some good points this building the V Continental Business Center V Continental we can see oh this is a photo huh don't really recognize those number plates but it's not often you see number plates so the LA at the end there where are we um it's very confused right now sorry I went very quiet but I am very confused which is very easy um I can move oh I can go inside oh oh might help Christmas time foreign nice very nice places hmm are we Spanish speaking we can see the nope okay I'm going to carry on looking around I might speed it up but I'm gonna find some kind of signs writing something I found a flag but I don't know I've seen it but oh boy oh boy are you gonna be shouting at me for that um foreign Europe I probably spent through the bit where I said the plugs look very European um oh man hang on completely stumped on this one I can't even make a decision of where to plump it feel completely stoned um I just don't know I don't know what that is unless it's like a local flag absolutely stunned so I am going to plunk it I think it's a souvenir flag but maybe I'll put it in a slip in here put it in lubliana I don't think that's right but let's see where we were ah man I am rubbish this is not good all right last round maybe we'll get a 5K I only got one country right so far oh no not a long Country Road there's a truck there's a sign over here it's a river the zone who has flat things about their ease remember seeing a language of the flat line over the E is give me something truck damn Sun ruining everything as usual the Maybe uh hmm napping trailers I mean that sounds German or something doesn't it all right let's carry on up here sun is in the south east as I presume we should be in the northern hemisphere definitely some farming going on some more bollards I don't know anything about little notice board can't really see driving on the right obviously another cat here that's right in the screen excuse me and pop off sorry um bin no bench there's another truck here bus stop Ozil yards [Music] huh another language I'm not really familiar with but it looks to me like it must be in Europe um don't knock my water creatures right um I don't think that's Polish um e line across the e h okay I'm sure you guys are showing at me again did I know this stuff and just forgot or let's not forget about these guys up here unless it wasn't the line it was just look like it shall I go here somewhere oh look that looks maybe that's what it was foreign oh oh it's here now you've got flat things do you like my technical terms they've got flat things over there letters okay I think we are here don't think it's the reader I'm not see this river called I can't remember the name of that River we just saw so that's helpful I could just skipped back to the beginning let's get back to the end let's see if we can get not only the right country but quite close to where we are okay cat's just destroying stuff [Music] not that one I will probably speed this up let me have some water and I'll see you in a bit okay I'm not gonna find this uh water randomly I don't think because I thought it might not be a river it might be uh lake or whatever else you call wet patches to right oh man I'm losing it all right so I am going to go foreign go down here let's see right country hopefully oh we've got a badge ghosts and stuff congrats you are spooky yay spooky all right so okay right country yeah I got two two out of five okay not so bad did I get higher than average I got higher than average I am happy with that but man I am not very good with uh European languages apparently um no good at all well I better go feed this cat because he's obviously hungry let me know how you did in the comments below

"foreign how you doing you put the heating on yet neither have I not cold enough yet um so I saw Gio Peter and Geo wizard do uh videos of this map done tests for smart people it sounded like a really interesting map I haven't watched their videos yet or played their games I really want to but I thought I think it'd be a lot more fun if I recorded myself trying it first and then I can play away and not feel guilty that I haven't filmed something so let's get on with this I'm going to play this map see what it's like um looks like it's famous places but might not be the actual famous place haven't really done very well with famous places because there's some ones that I've never heard of but uh let's see how this goes I can't wait to play the GOP tour and Geo Wizards game after this it should be quite good fun so let's uh let's do this game let's set it as a challenge no limits let's have a fun game and uh try it out so oh yes invite you guys the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's try this map okay that looks like the art Triumph to me but that flag is wrong this says will Brook Platinum business and Convention Center this says Romania so we are definitely in Romania um I didn't know there was knocked a Triumph replica right I think I'm gonna try and find this without moving um yes I'm gonna try and find this without moving probably have to speed it up because I am slow let's see though um I guess it'll be in oh I'm guessing it's in a Bucharest and I'll be guessing it's right in the center um would it be as a roundabout I mean that doesn't look like the University of Iowa um for sure I'm gonna have a look what else is going on so it's like a park I don't really know what's going on over there um I'm not really sure but it is quite a few lanes there's a road name I mean that would be a good idea to have a look at wouldn't it okay I think I might speed this up I'm still gonna try and not move um and really try and pinpoint this I should be looking at the direction which I keep forgetting to do there's another row sign over there I don't know if I'll be able to see is that a rose sorry is that areas of Interest all right I'm gonna pinpoint this I shall be back thank you oh my word okay I don't know what I was doing here it is look there's got to be a grand Granite war memorial archway um the road name here isn't the same so I'm looking at the wrong ones is there another one we've got to be on this road here so I don't know why that road isn't the same but the layout looks right there's a bus stop here there's a road to the side and a Road Round right road to the side in a road round um another road up there it's got to be it's got to be here so I'm gonna go for it I spent too long looking at this I reckon so about there let's give it a go let's see how eight yards that'll do that'll do nicely how did I not notice that before these are massive Park and I said look there's a big part there I was all the way down here never mind good I'm glad I didn't fall for that one and go to the other the truth so let's see what the next one brings okay uh this looks like it's in America to me I guess that's supposed to be the pantheon um what is this sign say Federal defenses to build West was a strong point in the system was it blah blah blah the river on both sides of town which town oh it was placed here from time to time artillery sorry right okay don't know means nothing okay um where in America are we I think we should go that way it looks a bit more going on let's go down this way let's see this guy is who are you um patriotism something transportation I don't know don't know um let's see maybe this is a university or something on another person uh-huh I swear I'm probably gonna be missing something Centennial Park performing arts studios Centennial Park I'm sure there's quite a few Centennial Parks yeah Pantheon I don't know what that ass says let's carry on down here let's say Vanderbilt okay Poston Avenue it's a new part blah blah blah that no she doesn't say anything else I'm gonna go huh all right let's go down here let's see my Lord I found it I'll turn on so I found this sign for Knoxville and Memphis of 4 40. it took me a while to find Memphis embarrassingly um so I figured we've got to be in the middle now true I found the 440 here which is only in the city so which I guess joins the 40 together anyway found the person on here so Centennial part we're definitely here so let's see if we can pinpoint exactly where we started so does this look like a one-way Road no two-way Road pass it on is to the North East um I don't feel we're that far down so we've got to be here um can we see any other statues yeah so that's John W whoever John W is I guess we're off to the side what's these that's that road there I guess yeah so pretty around here see where the statue is a bit closer to the statues maybe about here let's give that a go let's try okay cool cool points again that's good I'm waiting for one that I won't be able to tell all the difference will uh we'll see I mean I've seen both of these ones so I guess that helps but uh let's see what we have next okay that I guess is supposed to look like the Golden Gate Bridge but it does not look like the Golden Gate Bridge pull to Center a massive church I don't know um so this doesn't look like Lisbon um and it's a photo sphere damn Porter Center hmm I don't know where this is I don't know where this big Jesus is um yeah this just does not look like the only other one that I know which is in um Lisbon in Portugal excuse me there's a lot of uh I guess religious artifacts I guess that's a giant cross on its side slimy all right I'm gonna have to figure this out another way so the Sun is in the south west so we're probably in the northern hemisphere I would guess um definitely a port Town there's a lot of shipping containers coming in report City I should say um I don't know I mean I thinking like thinking maybe South America I don't know okay I'm gonna have a look around South America foreign don't like my chances on this one though um so Porter Center Santiago is that Mexico all right let's have a look around South and Central America um yeah I'm gonna speed this up I'm gonna have a look around quite a few places around here and I will be back foreign so I found this place here but it doesn't line up with um the compass but it is Photosphere so I thought maybe had a look elsewhere I couldn't find anything else with such a big bridge I thought maybe it is the one in Lisbon maybe it is because this does line up and there is a port there I just remember it looking higher up but maybe because I was over there I don't know maybe it is so I'm gonna go for it I'm gonna say it is the one in Lisbon because this is circular as well I just it just does match up so I spent all that time excuse me kept scratching the TV there um I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go here and let's see it's gonna be wrong isn't it oh it is right oh I've just gone there first off I convinced myself it wasn't the one it has been but it was Okay so we're still on for a perfect score it's got to go downhill at some point right um okay David this looks like the right place to me um again another one I've been to so it's a floor look the same yeah it does look the same as when I went another photo sphere but I think this is the same so I'm gonna go for it how good is the pinpointing on um this photo sphere all right he's in Florence wasn't it I'm asking you in Florence I'm sure it was um and it was in a museum I can't remember the name of oh we had to cue for quite a while oh no you see there's quite a few museums in Florence sorry if you can hear okay running about like a maniac so not that one hopefully I'm hoping it's gonna say um that it's the home of sculptory Museum it's called choose him so I remember queuing around a corner oh how annoying I can't remember the name of it okay I'm gonna put this there a minute and carry on looking about I might speed this up because I'm gonna check every single Museum and gallery and uh see anything um don't worry just behave yourself boy hey hopefully the cat won't jump on anything and disturb stuff I will be back in a moment I hope with an answer oh here it is I found it I think hopefully this is the right one David here we go that's it it's like going further up when we visited this we walked past that but I think we did that afterwards but anyway we found it so I can only presume the pinpoint will be here and this is the room that he's in um let's hope for the best let us see nice three yards okay so I think all the other's been fake apart from this one let's see what we get on the last round could it all go wrong okay that looks like Sydney Harbor Bridge and the Opera House is this actually I mean why would you be able to put in two replicas in the same place I can see Australian flags up there so this has got to be it so that is in the North oh my God down here there's the Harbor Bridge so we've got to be in this park here I guess where's the Opera House this way right there's our Opera House don't sink we're that far out we must be here let's have a look so some of jetty that I mean the opera house is right there isn't it so I reckon I just done this first Bend here so maybe there yeah I think that let's give this a go and see if we get a perfect score I wasn't sure 25 yards would be too much but it wasn't oh my word let's double check a fixed score lovely okay very happy with that I'm hoping uh he's a gop's will do wizard didn't get a perfect score but I'm pretty sure they did probably a lot quicker than me um it'd be interesting to find out what rounds I got so I'll get to play that in a minute now um but yeah I'm very happy with that I'm glad I recognized the ones that weren't the ones that that thought it was no I did look at Lisbon I knew it was Lisbon I should have just gone with it well I did in the end so it was fine let me know how you did in the comments down below did you have you visited any of these well especially the um the non famous places that makes sense let me know in the comments below thank you very much for watching and I'll see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 44.46772043352269, "lng":

"foreign sorry oh yeah I've been doing sporadic uploads I guess well just missed one um I've been trying to edit a different type of video and it's much harder than I anticipated um it will come out at some point soon but basically I joined a league I did a a league game very strangely um it was stressful I want to share that with you um hopefully that will be out next week but um yeah it's taken me a lot longer than I anticipated to edit and also studying and working and anyway enough excuses let's give you guys a video I haven't played Geo guesser for a while because of all of this so I'd like a nice gentle easy game I found this a pinpointable Canada map and I enjoyed the last Canada map we did I thought might have some nice locations it will be a gentle map it shouldn't take too long but I'm not going to put on any time limits we're just gonna sit back chill out okay some geographer so with that said let's go and start this game so I'll invite you guys no settings link will be in the description if you want to play along and uh let's see where in Canada we are okay well maybe I could do this one without panning zooming scrolling moving but we'll see uh Halifax Forum so Halifax is here kind of looks like that's on the uh river right maybe it's down here the waterfront do you think it's a venue am I being silly and not moving probably but I'll move if I need to um how do you facts Convention Center or something called Halifax forum I don't know why I think it's on this save see front isn't it it looks like a harbor building um but it could be quite quite wrong so I haven't come across it straight away I will probably speed this up but I'm gonna see how long I can last without moving perhaps I should just spin round I'm betting you guys are already mood spun round pinpointed it and made your guess in the time I've taken already I might just do that let's let's spin round let's spin around before I speed it up okay Windsor Street on the seafront hmm oh Windsor Street and a bus stop maybe not even in Halifax you never know oh yeah I moved oh well yeah Halifax forum is that I gotta state it wins the street okay I'm gonna carry on looking about it's obviously not that close to the Waterfront so I am gonna have a look around and um I will be back found it okay so I found Windsor Street first off when I was looking around here and then here is a Halifax forum and we were opposite London Street and had a look at these signs here let's see on this corner here let's see come on full score yes yes right next one so that's some French call International is this an airport so I spin round are you an airport you look like an airport you're an airport kill so not sure which airport but let's have a look I think I had this airport before um one three in the 401 409 427. um I'm gonna try to cut back first name see some fours here but because you would be looking out of town for an airport wouldn't we the 40 no 40 where is the airport oh there's the airport I don't think it's that airport no okay let's move on let's go down the road and true uh this is an International Airport do you have a big round parking garage or whatever that is I will probably speed this up hope they have already but um yeah I will probably speed this up [Music] okay so it is Toronto 401 427 I guess the 409 is around somewhere but I can't work out where we are almost 409 hmm right this is a nice gently easy game there's a 409 right maybe go around here somewhere okay so we can see c b r e and coal International um CBRE like the Canadian bank or something actually you can see Runway Congress Center is that maybe oh oh um sorry guys this is not exciting this is going directly into a cup and you stay on this road for one three four oh one four oh nine four two seven so where's the big round car park that's what I don't get it's got to be around here somewhere oh it wasn't seemed enough Okay so we are probably on one of these roads I would say maybe here because that one goes off to that this one carries on but there's only one round one of these Rays might be underneath yeah huh I think you must be uh why is there so many roads it doesn't need to be so many roads does the okay I'm sticking with that let's just do it okay good much longer than it needs to be okay moving on and I've definitely had that round before I don't know why I'm so slow because I'm out of touch Elgin 26. it's Saint George Street St Thomas and we're heading towards London okay and then her um Central Elgin Community so I'm guessing Elgin is a place and we should be able to find it let's try this probably Prairie Land right again 26 all right I am gonna look about for Elgin see this isn't the same style as it's different Road type what do you call it oh I did see that down here in Toronto didn't I yeah all right I am going to look around Elgin Mills okay is this where we are this is the 25 um 25 Angus Eldon Community Center hmm maybe I'm a lot closer than I thought so I thought I saw 27 did I know I guess not okay I'm gonna look around Toronto for this road number 26. still don't hold out a ton of hope that we're here but you never know there's a train line all right I'm gonna have a look around and see you in a bit I think I found it I think I have found it so I remembered there is a place called London so it took me a while to find it but it's here then I saw that there was a place called Saint Thomas I presumed it was Thomas Road because that's George's Street so I had a look around I found the 26 which is here since George Street then I found the train line so I followed the train line until I found an Esso garage not bad I think I think that went well so and then also up here that says Wellington Road rehabilitation that's weird um so let's see can we see the road names here Parkland or something Linda's Park Drive so maybe that's Crescent Avenue oh who knows oh yeah Lynnhurst I did see Lynnhurst okay so I reckon we are here I think we are here in front of this house the next house I think we're in front of this house here all right let's give it a go yes yes what a nice game no pressure this is beautiful all right so this is a little easier he's 87 North museums in four blocks and we are Second Street quite a bit of signage maybe I'll try it without moving again a blue signs blue I sing green right I did see blue here we are okay 37 and that museum somewhere there could be museums anyway couldn't there um Let's scan for a 37 shall we just go into the Big Town Saskatoon my voice is getting highly pitched all right I'm gonna look around for the 37 which hopefully I'll stumble upon in a minute I'll be back I found it Rutland Avenue 37. Second Street my word I've only gone and bloody found it okay so we're on this Junction which is 37 and the Second Street huh I'm gonna snap it bang in this corner in this corner on this Crossroads that'll do for me hopefully this is the right place okay good good good last round okay Jasper Avenue I feel like I've had this round before as well something golden something Chinese um CDI College Reeves College I don't know Jasper Avenue World Trade Center Edmonton so we're in this is what Edmonton looks like huh nice Okay so Edmonton is here um I guess we're in downtown there's Jasper Avenue my word is going too well right let me just completely not see what I'm looking for foreign because you know that's that's how I roll um oh Jasper Avenue is a big okay let's plunk his hair a minute what have we got around um so Jasper Avenue I guess is this one right yeah because we're going west so what's this road a hundred Street yeah 100 Hunter Street huh okay and is this water in front of the college stuff Economic Development where's the uh why is that also a hunter Street Northwest I I don't understand your roads don't make sense that looks like what Metro Station so confused so confused but I think we're here I really do I think we're here I think we're here so I'm gonna do it okay wrong Junction but I don't think [Music] not gonna argue like it done it perfect score yes perfect score beautiful Canada didn't really go to BC oh well oh Manitoba and I'm not sure how you pronounce it but I enjoyed that that was a nice relaxing game it's so satisfying when you get a perfect score I know it's fairly easy but it still you know makes you feel happy right so let me know how happy you are in the comments because you won hopefully someone did it quicker than me because I'm sure it took a little while on that one but I still had fun chilled out now I shall go back to try and get that video edited for you guys um see what you think of it hopefully it'll be fun but we will see anyway thank you very much for watching enjoy your weekend and I'll see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 44.65502576629179, "lng": -63.6044244605492}, {"round": 2, "lat": 43.68354537751512, "lng": -79.60969144868561}, {"round": 3, "lat": 42.7925710502031, "lng": -81.21008310065338}, {"round": 4, "lat": 50.09298651261937, "lng": -108.4833190021776}, {"round": 5, "lat": 53.54117587239058, "lng": -113.4902688481585}], "images_path": "data/images_geocatto/0I6oEzVuQg0szSY9"}

I'd like to speed this up because I know how long I take to try and find these streaks and stuff so um yeah I'll see you in a bit but hopefully I would have pinpointed it but um okay okay I found it so it says where's Clara oh well Santa Clara Street next right and then Julian Street second right so that's Santa Clara Julian Street so that must be that road coming off to freeway power clay Highway big Road big Road um the speed limit or the RoadMate I don't know right let's um roads this one Adobe North Tower here we go so that's the Adobe Tower there's that big talk I don't know okay that's cool um though Wild headquarters where's Sage I think that would be on here wouldn't you start anything about Sage how do you get interesting shape buildings it must be these ones these two so I think we are a bit further down here was a road huh these strange buildings ah these bloody roads it could be if we're here hang up what's happening over here Sub Center next two exits okay I'll stop mucking about I think we're um we're on this road um must be around that I I don't know it's so confusing let's see let us see oh 56 yards all right be a bit more trustful even though I I go road blind with the American roads let's try the next one okay this is not gonna be easy um so world cities there's quite a lot of cities big cities will be talking um which way do we go let's try this way it's official coverage posters Dominion City right there's a ring a barrel City maybe that's a like a H like a center like a gig Center or something I mean I didn't say any of those right words oh what's wrong with me um okay can we carry signs bagos here we go I think we're gonna find this school Maybe I can't remember what country the house is in yes I can okay do you want to say it out loud because I I'm just no good no good with these things was that just advert for them is this where the school is our Market look let's have a look I might speed this up so I'm going to look for this school and this Archer market and see if I can pinpoint this one because that would be pretty cool um yeah perfect score last one I think so yes I did my brain is doing well for this map I will see you in a bit okay I'm really annoyed and just yeah just annoyed I cannot find anywhere called Aja and I've seen that name so many places around here now but I just can't find it it's annoying because then it must be must be pinpointable but I cannot find it um so I'm gonna have to plonk it and I really don't want to but I just can't spend any longer looking for this place ah so last question where do I block it where do I block it I feel like I should plunk it fairly Central so big there's so much information please let me know how you guys found it if you did find it it's definitely findable and I hope somebody did but I'm gonna have to plunk it I think I might plunk it here let's see let's put me out my misery I looked over here how did I not see that I looked this simmed out how did I not see that oh that is embarrassing that is embarrassing there's Bale street I was looking for as well and these two roads here I am disappointing okay let's just go sorry guys that was pretty rubbish because I was looking for Market symbols man right let's just move on move swiftly on right are we back in the Americas again uh let's see Greek Mediterranean cuisine Moxie on mess let me um towel Lake Tahoe so we in the states and let's see let's go this way shall we Indigo Indie Fringe is this place called indie Indiana Circle City right a little circle um let's see sorry that last round has really put me into that mood ah where are you going bus hey something Dale Town Center um definitely in the states he has the usual Flags Old National Bank Mass Avenue Massachusetts be straight chat March and there's lots of words as is usual on signs but nothing that means anything to me yeah I get we're a Massachusetts Avenue and Indie friend just means independent right or is there something else that I'm unaware of um okay everything's on mass I get it let's move away from Mass to Michigan okay we're gonna have on Mitch um I mean foreign that really helps can we not shout about how much you love your city put in these best so do I look okay I mean this is a big old road and North East uh that's Idaho Indiana's estate right yes there it is so we're gonna look at him Indianapolis for on Mass the Kentucky Missouri huh all right I'm gonna have a look and um let's see so where city is Southwest so I should be up here somewhere oh yeah yeah that's 270. all right we found it so where did we start Moxie on mass Petra can we find uh yes these are the road names so what was what was East something about an arch as well just east I have east Northeast Metro Cafe here we go ah okay I feel a bit better now well I haven't score yet bye Kalam I don't think you can pick it up on this bike but really annoys me I'm already annoyed with myself right let's pop this here and let's see yes okay good four yards right so let's keep that up the last two rounds hopefully I'll uh get myself with a better mood so we've got what looks like John oh yeah dot d e so yes where's where's the blurs not a single blur hmm silver gastrasen I don't think that's got a city name on it what about you cause and I think we need to go down here I try my German it's not very good the only thing I can remember is that's really cute black forest gato and that's only because it sounded so cool uh so silver extra again and it's just a road name I believe yes okay so I don't know what city we're in um uh right so where do we go where do we go that looks like some mountains that what he'll maybe not quite a mountain tram where are you going building so we've got trams we've got pills um we must be somewhere down south I think but don't quote me on that um so I will probably carry on looking for something oh I stood to God right yes so it would be good to find out what this road is called because this is a big Road we'll be going kind of here we go all right let's go right so excuse me we are going Southwest West West again I'll probably speed this up because so uh and I'll see you soon okay I think got it campus in Brown I think we are here got a bit confused because I couldn't see any trams on the map so I was like how where are the drums because I thought these would be underground but they're not they are the traps I guess I don't know but I think I found it I think I'm in the right place so let us see 26 yards bit far down still four points all right last round what are we gonna get what is gonna happen Okay so we have got what's up Creek or Turkish no huh I am confused Bulgaria laughs caused very badly then I got more trams um oh exactly hmm do you know that um so which way to get her faster as anything really cool an EU thing on it let's see foreign I am sorry confused how are you think of Bulgaria because that will get to back or something uh all right so now oh okay um yeah I'm really stumped um it's not a country I think I've been in sorry NGO I guess it before um I knew as usual last round got me stumped see I cannot read a thing uh which does not help I help at all looks like a stadium down there the Bulgaria um I can't remember so I don't think yeah I mean it doesn't use it must be Bulgaria Bulgaria is probably Sophia um well what would I use pinpoint huh I mean do they have he's also gurko okay I think it's worse trying to have a look they've got trams here so I mean it's got to be I'm just gonna say yeah I found it it's the right place I'm gonna pinpoint these roads I mean it's the last round it's got to happen right um battery's running low of course because you know I never predict I'm gonna take this long at the game um so I'm gonna find these and I will be back that wasn't where I started I'm gonna find something and I'll be back okay I think I found it when I was back I was hoping to find Subway but Subway is not listed on here um but we have Alliance Bank over here this is these Xbox started in right yeah so I think we are here you know Indian or another store you know but I think we are here so maybe over here see how accurate this is oh I got a badge oh I got five thousand points okay so 24 907 that will do that will do very nicely oh well it's worth spending all that time trolling around I am so disappointed with this round I really could have got that how did I back on that not gonna go back on that oh well I am sure some of you would have still beat me on that also I'm sure some of you did it quicker than me but let me know how you did in the comments below and um please let me know how I missed some of the stuff and I've also I don't know how I don't know how that happened let me know

guys welcome back to another geography along um i realized that there's a very classic map that i haven't done on camera uh for a good reason because it's quite hard but i diverse world i haven't played that yet so i thought it was about time to uh get my big boy pants on and play this game in front of people probably quite embarrassing uh but of course it will be a nice casual gentle game and we see how we get on um it looks like a you know an average score before on this map quite quick for my standards so we'll see how i get on with this one uh and hopefully you guys will beat me because you know i don't hold out much hope but let's see how it goes you never know so let's set it as a challenge no limits or anything on this map invite you guys link will be in the description below if you would like to play along let's see where we go cool right a bit of the google car there i wish i could say i know that matter and this is such and such place but um i don't i'm thinking maybe canada is it yellow lines in the middle for america's i think but uh let's take a look at this sign mata chowan first nation wrote so yes we are in canada um but couldn't tell you what um province they call it provinces in canada i think let's say let's say you whiskey jack creek cool okay so i guess this sign says the lake oh cool we've got some road signs there see what numbers are you 65 and 66. oh there's loads of signs down here look at elk lake again 65 and 66 kirkland lake 56 miles okay i think we got enough ah lovely all lined up perfectly okay i think we definitely got enough information to go and have a look um yeah let's let's go i mean is that i think that's french is it it looks more german to me but you know finn is is it's french isn't it so maybe in the french provinces all right i'm gonna look for the roads first i think is the best thing and then try and look for these lakes and this these place names here i'll probably speed this up because you know me it's gonna take a while and i will see you in a bit oh well that didn't take very long i found it here mata mata chowin mata cherwan there's elk lake so um 65 ends and the 66 goes either way on the road that i'm currently looking at um so there's a 66 here so that's five six six but this works five miles that way oh yes it is still the 66. okay so we must have started up just up here there's reserve right let's go back to where we started so that was a sign for this road here i reckon i reckon so i think we're probably here we're just in front of the road so we should be here okay diverse world first round filming let's see what we get lovely four points very nice very nice but we had an abundance of signs which amazing amazing let's see what the next one brings okay um getting south america vibes kind of fly is that yeah but i don't i can't tell me one mountain from another um still no clues on that flag let's see what this sign over here says good again we've got a couple of signs more this star do you think that might be a place name happy littardo [Music] well it looks spanish so it's spanish speaking um camino real zippercon cool what's this sign here say same thing okay um right i'm not sure there's point looking at any more i'm trying to find any more information um i don't know okay i'm gonna have a look around the map what am i looking for though this i think i might look for that in south america where oh sorry um can we see the sun not really eh but it seems we're quite high up um fairly damp that makes sense so maybe a bit lower down there quick all right i'm making it up i really am um and have a look around for this place drawn to chile for some reason um might be peru i don't know there's a lot of places i'm gonna have a good scar around and see what i can find otherwise i'll come back and look for some more clues okay i've got to stop i spent probably about half an hour trying to look for this place there isn't many places that start with zed but all the ones i found isn't zippercon um and i just don't know where to go don't know and i really want to find it but i've got to stop this is only the second round uh so i'm going to have to plunk it i just don't know where ah my first thought was chili or peru so i should do it around here maybe i'll go bolivia so frustrating i've searched quite a lot of south and central america uh and i haven't found it so i think i need to stop stop myself stop and go with i don't know my belly's making noises now let's see another zip said maybe i will go paraguay [Music] all right it looks like a fairly main road let's just go here let's see oh oh i'm glad i didn't go all the way down the bottom of chili is in columbia where are you zippercon there you are there you are i didn't spend any time looking around columbia that was silly wasn't it okay well it could have been a lot worse so i am quite happy i've got to do be much quicker on the next one so the voice my camera battery will not last so let's get on with this oh no right um so driving on the right i know there's plenty of bolognese for people who know bullets i don't know bollards so i don't know i don't have an inkling either i mean i think in european but maybe like northern oh that gives me spain disney vibes ah huh let's see if we can find anything some more random nice random gates let me get some language off of that no no huh i just wrote signed i don't know why that one was blurred out i can't really no okay let us continue that's so weird so many signs none of them have been useful excuse me sorry oh my portuguese why can't i not see anything this looks like a sign i'm leaving toro n383 is that a road number do you ever look in portugal see what the town looks like hmm i'm not so sure now yeah i'm not not sure okay let's go back to this white stone see that's a road number and i'm going to start in europe not so sure it's portugal now but and have a look and i will be back i found it i found it i bloody found it and 383 in this district i don't know i thought i might get that but uh when it's 53a3 so you have to be quite zoomed in to see it i had a look at the other sign back here it said avogadro abergard at the back of it so that's definitely portuguese so we were on the n383 just how far quite far um so this little post oh look i could have seen that maybe uh yeah it'll be 19 miles out i don't know how i'd find that one here though do i just take a guess do i make it really accurate hmm do we go to the town and count how many roads i don't think there's any actual roads what's there i'm going to try and pinpoint this so bear with me a moment so there's that road here you could say it's more like a driveway right driveway huh [Music] let's be the road at the beginning right i suppose these are all little driveways aren't they all these buildings i'm gonna say we're near these buildings let's just go back again so this one could be that one coming off here right why not why not there's a bend in the road going east i'm gonna do it i'm going to do it here and let's see i don't believe it maybe of course we are the other side of it if i believe that that was i don't believe it i really don't believe it sorry if you can hear that alarm there's some mopeds that like to chain each other to themselves and then they set each other's alarm off when they unclip right let's go let's get this done quickly two more rounds because my battery is running out um [Music] there's a lot of blurring going on here but here we go national beautiful landscape um right go down here is there anything what was it blurring out i don't understand um so i'm just checking if i can pick up if we're i think there's a funnel on the car it's kenya and if there's a crack in the sky it's usually um that french place is um i don't know i don't even know where to start okay i can't find a national park the graffiti or however it should be actually pronounced um i don't know where to plonk it i just don't have an idea these have got there in it maybe i should pop it down here because yes it looks dusty but it looks like it's also been wet you know [Music] so and i'm rushing because i don't want the camera to run out i've got a spare battery but you know it's that's an ideal isn't it so i might pop it down here somewhere though um i really wanted to just find a national park and it will be great don't mind right french-ish damp ish so many places um i haven't looked at cameroon i don't think that's very french so is it or is it very french i don't know enough all right all right all right i'm gonna punk it i'm gonna plunk it i'm gonna regret i'm gonna regret but i'm gonna plunk it all the way down here mozambique my zombie connect to zimbabwe i didn't look at madagascar okay i'm gonna i'm gonna plunk it where i plonked it let's see oh you gotta be kidding me i didn't even consider it could be south america where's the graffiti national not there huh never mind i was never going to find that oh you know fairly okay okay okay not going to get a great score let's go last round let's see if i can claw something back um right let's see if these little markers help us again so an r and 52 sounds like france i don't recognize your road markings though um they're definitely trying on the right a few palm trees and a flag over there let's see what flower we got going on is that the russian flag oh is it you know how great i am with flags it doesn't feel like russia but it might be i suppose all right let's go come on just move it let's get down this road i haven't gone to red on the battery symbol yet so we're doing all right so what number again was that 52 i think the owls for russia nothing on these ones just a little bit of language i can't quite see that one enough to decide what the characters look like i mean this looks like a fairly main road there's got to be some signs somewhere right ads and such kind of carry you looks like an old car see that doesn't look like cyrillic so i'm just mucking up my flags fendi yeah i don't think we're in russia um what's this going on what is going on here la la something [Music] uh huh well guys right now i'm gonna beat my other school definitely not in time um come on all right i'm gonna probably speed this bit up because it's taking it's doing that slow step thing it sometimes does so i'll be back in a minute once i get to the end of the road i finally made it to a sign mosquitos eight kilometers 56 i saw a sign 55 um this is already just go down the road ah i don't know why it makes me so angry but it does um mosquitoes hey is that the name of the river maybe oh come on okay i'm too annoyed i can't go any further just let me get to that sign this street names eight men holland i don't think that's what he said so um right i really don't know so i'm going to just look around [Music] the map and uh this is really annoying me and we'll be back around south america um yeah looking for mosquitoes on the road number eight i'll be back probably quite quickly okay there's a lot of places in south america with this shield style road and a number eight um [Music] so yeah i don't really know i didn't find any mosquitos but i'm gonna stick with paraguay not one i go with very often but why not um wait i need to get at least three and a half thousand to beat my previous school i don't think that's gonna happen so let's move it further up the road shall we let's do that yeah let's see let us see now i'm going to keep it down here yeah all right come on let's see i've got a new badge from mapper for a diverse world oh it was down here it was this green one oh well i'm glad i went where i did then because i had to look all the way along this number right dawn i should have stuck with the greens oh well never mind that'll teach me that'll teach me indeed where's mosquitos what does that mean then then i went quite far down the road but i don't know doesn't matter so i've got 3134 points does that mean i'll beat my previous i don't think so what was the final score sixteen four four four maybe that did maybe that did beat my previous score who knows but i am hungry and tired and i need to stop playing now and embarrassing myself they're recording for an hour and a half so this is going to be a fun wonder would it i'm glad i got a couple of 5k so that's that made me very happy um but the rest of these south americas i am obviously not very good at them at all but not too bad really really well let me know how you guys did in the comments below any tips for south america would be greatly appreciated and central america one day i will get there let me know your score in the comments below thank you very much for watching and i will see you in the next one ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 47.95862565006045, "lng": -80.59200779517022}, {"round": 2, "lat": 4.753055572387591, "lng": -74.38312218737411}, {"round": 3,

"hello welcome back to another geography along um i got a suggestion from my dad to look for a map about castles and things so i found this one which is castles and forts of the world sounds interesting should get some pretty cool looking locations and again maybe some more places to look to go and visit when you know there's flights available and such um but yeah let's uh let's get into this map i said it as a challenge no time limits or anything a nice chilled bank holiday weekend for those in the uk map to play invite you guys link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's see where we are all right that's a flag i've not seen before feels maybe european yeah yeah um let's go down here don't worry this can't read it okay here we go jan carl's garden vita bjorn right so scandi i presume scandi countries um what is this one says parking um i want to go back up here let's look around the corner this little sign [Music] no fishing maybe one of those words is a place but i just don't know all right so i think the best chance of getting decent information of that this way let's go down this road see what we can find [Music] lots of out of the way places i mean i think it's sweden but i'm not entirely sure oh hey cat but don't do that to the night all right i'll probably cut that down oh the cat is fighting with me over the mic i can get to my mouth again now um okay so this symbol here i'm sure i've seen that in austria more often so maybe we're not in scandinavia okay that way sorry the cat's rolling around again now um wait no ah don't ever work with animals all right let's carry on up this road and see signs that are blurred that looks like german post so maybe we are austria [Music] something slot let's see this thing this way full home slot yam cole's garden do i go austria do i go scandinavia [Music] sweden i think probably quite a lot of blurs so maybe on the border with germany [Music] [Music] um okay i am going to look around austria i think yes i'll look around austria and see if i can find anything while the cat's swishing his turn i have to give up i can't find it i'm sure it's in sweden um i was hoping i would just happen upon it of course um but no luck so i'm gonna plonk it i think it's around here there's a lot of different slots which i guess means castle or fort or something like that around here mainly around this area so i hate to do it but i'm going to plunk it i'm going to plunk it [Music] here let's see how far away we work look at this group of gardens no [Music] really good point so okay well i'll take that is that sweet or is that finland then i'm feeling that's finland yeah i think that's finland so i didn't even get the right country uh how so good wouldn't i just pop over there and have a look oh because i told myself that's finland hmm whatever how did you guys do all that did you find any other clues but i didn't look around much never mind let's try the next one that was only round one let's try the next one um all right it's kind of looks french maybe um it's a photosphere so that's that's not great here's all we get right okay carol bamps who took this picture um it reminds me of french but maybe is this the uk um i think i'm gonna stick with france i'm gonna go fairly north because this does look like uk foliage um i really hope it's not the uk ah i mean what else is there to go on i mean that looks a bit dutch but it's hold maybe it is holland there's a little bit like a building that's in my mom's hometown and the bikes add up hmm maybe i'll go holland i wish doesn't tell me anything um a label or something handy i might go holland um where you ask it's a good question uh maybe i don't know i don't know maybe around here somewhere let's find [Music] a point of interest on the map not that place museum it um up as a fork like would it be this kind of symbol um let's stick my marker there there's one place um it's gonna be in the greenery somewhere right i mean i'm going for this area because this is the area i know more of i don't really know much i've been damaged forward i don't really know much up north here um quite nice oh there's a lot of options right i'm gonna have to plunk it because i mean what else can we go with here's some water that looks like a castle rather than a posh house which is what it is it's a posh house so i might just stick with where i plonked it already excuse me um [Music] yeah i feel this is gonna be very wrong this could go very very wrong doesn't the queen have a palace or something down here or king now i guess um don't know where it would be let's just go with my first point let's go with it let's see i bet you it's going to be in france and i'm going to be very upset all right let's do it let's do it belgium the in between we were ah castile with the castle lumber bar all right well cool cool at least it was in the uh dutch speaking part i guess let's go with that it was in between so you know i was kind of right thought it was france and went holland and it was belgium and again not too bad in points i'm liking this map i guess because it's a world map that that's not too far a distance okay let's try the next one right we are in no we are in japan okay cool so where are we i've seen this in so many videos you can't remember wow it is uh right okay so i think down south in the castle yeah which castle kyushu right i think it's down here somewhere but the two people i've seen go to it live up here um yeah i think it's down here uh let's see let's try and look for kitakyushu um i guess i'll end up looking around the whole of japan probably uh [Music] i need to catch up on my candy loading but here's kitty kitty shoes so i'm sure it's this castle that's around here now we can just find the castle we're done um i thought it would just be there nice and easy to see but not [Music] or i'm just completely in the wrong place it's you know possible there it is okay i think maybe this is the right place just outside big square a bit house west no i don't know but yeah i can go for it i'm gonna leave this here uh quite a big complex of stuff isn't it but yeah i'm gonna kind of stick with there let's see oh look at that we went inside the castle but we got four points so yay fidget cat oh i'm glad i got that one oh right now i just need a uk round for me to just completely fail at that so let's see what we have next is a very cool looking place come on load up all right really short of the language there are you like romania or hungary or somewhere like that let's get another photo sphere taken by the three king chords something like that don't really know number plate so i can't really get anything from that i can't read this but it looks like we've got the little bits above a's [Music] america i mean right the sun is but it's photosphere so we might not be able to rely on that let's look at romania see what i mean about the language and the same with hungary scene so but it could be south america we haven't had anything outside of japan um there's obviously quite a lot of thoughts around here this is more like a very old manner maybe i think i might go portugal you know wait doesn't add up i'm gonna go romania make up your mind uh yeah i'm gonna go romania why not and um we've got any little castle thing there anything else about it um i'm trying to do it closer to the borders you know hungry sorry um gosh this is so hard it's a lot harder than i thought it would be thanks dad um i'm gonna stick with um romania that was my first walk mexico i might go a bit closer to the border um [Music] but i can't really see anything maybe i'd stick with my first plank i'm gonna stick with my first plant let's go let's see right country nope it was latvia right there you go completely wrong that did kick me in the teeth with points out maybe i should have sent a bit longer now i would never have guessed that yeah excuse me boy thank you okay let's see now last round last round come on load okay so we're not going to get any uk ones which is quite surprising a little disappointing um this looks i don't know i mean these look like olive trees this looks middle eastern maybe we are morocco that would make sense another photo is here um [Music] very dry excuse me everybody's drying right now so that big little round something a hill to build up what's going on why don't you think i like morocco could be algeria that always gets me but no i'm gonna go morocco um probably near the coast um so let's find the point of interest and just go with it it's like a town isn't it with uh something else more interesting going on do you think we're very far away from a big place and they're probably a day trippers party aren't they i mean it feels like the seas over there i don't know why what's this a bit too close i think um is a little bit green about right close to spain what's going on okay look further out here there's and things um nothing's feeling right because this is how you play the game not with noise just with phoenix um this is actually spain this part isn't it maybe it's on this weird border it's a weird spanish point maybe i'll go around here is there like any noodles or anything this is probably quite clean let's go here let's go and let's see let's have a look come on well it was morocco i put me in spain just that weird little bit of spain that's in morocco so technically not the right country all the way down here where were we so [Music] we were there um a bit more a lot more to the south than i thought but i'm quite proud that i got that morocco gas could it yeah technically spain but i don't know i'm quite proud of myself quite proud of myself all right let's see what the final score was just under 20. that's a shame that looks terrible doesn't it but i got quite close on the rest huh not bad not bad at all obviously very happy with myself with the japan round but uh this one that one's bad well how did you guys do it was what did i miss on some of these places uh could have done better with gardening did you look around more on this finish round is there something i missed was there a big old sign that i could have seen well let me know in the comments below let me know how you did thank you very much for watching and i will see you next time ",

the first time we had a pride march in brighton so should be good fun um this is why i'm recording this early because it's going to be a busy weekend but let's get into this game shall we so let's set it as a challenge i'm not going to put any limits on it just have a nice fun easy game hopefully easy and uh let's invite you guys link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's try this map out let's see where we are okay coming out roma it's an interesting name for okay but i guess this must be the gay quarter look at that right next to the uh coliseum oh look at that no what would you call that dinner but yeah that's very nice area look at those rooms here as well i never saw this part when i visited but it was too hot for me so just a quick run around the colosseum been left again so right so we should be able to pin this pin point this one quite easily but we all know me and my directions so coliseum here i guess these are the ruins no uh where are those ruins that we can see now here we go coming out bar ruins of an ancient gladiatorial arena huh that's interesting but we are outside coming out here let's just check so more in front of royal so maybe here probably let's see come on five thousand six yards out yes that's a nice good start wonderful let's try the next one um spain yep so very european map so far i like it what city are we in though um [Music] it was pride flag or this maybe the gay area could be look over here um don't know don't know um the hotel patio well that's a good thing to look out for well i'm pinpointing still an okay flag so but let's have a look if we can find out where we are [Music] what's that a road name alameda hercules okay i should be able to remember that let's see what this is sevilla landia okay you think we're in seville seville maybe andalucia okay i think we must be in that area let's just go to the street sign and find that so seville [Music] um i think andalusia is the area right uh i don't know i don't know for sure right um i guess we're in the center um see if we can find that hotel patio something otherwise i'm gonna have to scour around and find this street um hercules alameda hercules um i should look what direction the road is going as well okay so i think i will speed this up because i got everything to be able to pinpoint it so i should do that so i will see you shortly okay i found the owl i made the hercules here um so please pinpoint where we are because i presume we were near these things wow good description near these things um maybe uh where's this hotel i can't see that hotel either up here it's quite a long road hotel patio here we go um police station just because there's a police car there police station okay this is good this is very good we're right outside on this crossing the crossing on here probably not um [Music] i can't see that road got to be slap bang in the middle of this so i reckon we're here yeah let's try that okay come on two yards lovely lovely thank you very much wonderful right we are on track for a perfect score so calm we can do this we can do this right taste of brazil dot ie so we must be in ireland um the larder so again i can't see uh a rainbow flag or anything like that um or any gay friendly bars doesn't mean this might not be might be a gay center um [Music] okay stop looking for that and i will look instead to find out what town city city um something parliament definitely an island okay come on sort yourself out let's just just get away from the buildings because i can't see anything caught kill i still can't work that out yeah that's better okay so i don't know i'm dublin maybe transport for ireland doesn't give us much oh moving about on these maps is really annoying me today uh what's this building here this looks like an important building dublin free wi-fi okay so we're definitely in dublin let's see if there's a road sign exchange court city hall okay so let's find city hall in dublin right got to be near the center wouldn't it do gotta be in this part here so let's have a quick look there's a lot of stuff going on here i thought it would be nice and quick and easy city hall okay it's not that bad so i think we're on this street let's go back to the beginning the front lounge taste of brazil um says city hall so it's definitely down here somewhere full moon [Music] was it further up here no um love lane oh wall of love what's that um right stick with what you're doing why can't i see any of these places okay what what else there's a subway um ask us something where's the subway here so is it just not there anymore maybe are we outside full moon thai restaurant that's the larder there's a spa did i see a spa oh here you go lgbt helpline oh that's good right so it doesn't help me with oh hey there's a spa there's after right here bus stop yes cool zero yachts we've got to be over here because we're on the pavement but we're not outside the spa outside whatever whatever this is so here oh there's a ladder temporary closed right let's see oh come on still 5 000 points 10 yards but 5 000 points okie dokie let's see if we can make it on a perfect score where are we now dutch love cannabis touch love that's a bit rude that's what everybody thinks of in holland and it's not i don't [Music] love the village okay so french are we in canada um let's go down here and are we in that place i went to vancouver vancouver went to yeah i think so it's not working today okay yeah bank street ca so definitely canada uh you're from ottawa a lot of stuff here for ottawa which makes sense with the french around so [Music] shall we just have a look in our tour and find bank street just say green borough lands down lincoln fields i think i'm filter stadium okay i'm gonna have a look in uh not uk let's have a look because it could be once rule but well there's lansdowne park there's lansdowne was on that bus sign um we're looking for bank street um so it might be like an area [Music] but maybe not a downtown bank of canada museum must be here somewhere right bank street anybody anybody i will get street slatter i'd say it's quite a big one right it's bank of canada why am i getting stung back because it's back street this is bank street i should have checked the compass okay let's go back to the beginning uh we were outside dutch love electric market oh yeah nipping street knee bean street yeah here dutch love cannabis okay so this is where i popped my marker anyway oh look at that right on the junction so probably around here then right come on oh yes another two yarder cool okay last round last round we in [Music] yes i've paused i'm aware i'm sorry i'm trying to work out it looks i don't think this is this is hong kong taiwan there's no japanese uh but let's double check that sorry if you can hear the cats mucking about so one of you commented recently that utility poles in taiwan yellow and black diagonal stripes on them so let's see if we can find taipei city maybe we are in taiwan what else can we see here taipei chang um i don't know what that means but we've got to be in taipei right yes no don't know um right let's see if we can find a street sign i mean there's to be loads of 7-elevens and family mart um the tango is at a hotel i mean that's japanese i'm glad i didn't see that straight off because i'll be like oh right we're in japan what does that say i don't know katakana is not my friend i am no good with that okay let's have a look i guess we'll find the tango looks like quite a big building is a hotel oh look there's some road signs over here i should have started with that really can we want to see them taipei bus station yeah okay so we are definitely in taipei there is a church that might be probably a few of those and then the road name and there's a cat right taipei so changan east road section one oh i didn't realize taipei was split like this this is going to make it a little harder i guess if i find the bus station that would get me near okay i'm definitely going to speed this up i am going to pinpoint this because we are on track for a bucket school i want it i want it i will see you in a bit okay so i found on that junction some signs for linton lindsen road and the changham east road i've found with the churches so just trying to find pinpoint where we are so there's oh there there i just jumped back to the beginning i was like oh i saw a nightclub around here somewhere i can't even remember now it's so confusing there's not a lot of english here and i'm getting a bit lost but i think i have found it now which is cool so we've got 85 sexy there's a parking lot there 85 bar authentic japanese room j yakitori bar goldfish izakaya so we're outside room j and near the car park winston road north could i have seen that taiwan go okay so i was a bit blinded thinking it was maybe japan missing japan as usual okay i think we are here so let's see can we get a zero yard on the last round let's go oh three yard but perfect score yay oh i'm so glad i think it feels like it's been ages since i've had a perfect score amazing amazing what part of did we end up in okay so it was in the main old main i don't know maybe i'll go there one day and find out and see but cool right let's have a look at the summary perfect score lavalier still didn't see many flags or gay-friendly places maybe they're so underground that some of these places are just not going to advertise it but perfect score on a wonderful weekend first time in two years to celebrate gay

can explain the hat i promise welcome back to another geographic play along um i found this map called a world of hats i thought i'd wear a hat or you know why not um and of course i'm recording this a week before it's going to come out we're still in a heatwave i think this is a very bad idea but why not why not try it another extra layer of heat related excuses for not doing very well but i think it should be interesting um i mean like it's going to be anywhere in the world uh it's moderate difficulty these people had done it fairly quickly who knows who knows might get really lucky with the rounds so let's just dive into this game tell it as challenge not going to set any limits on this one uh let's just enjoy some hats the link will be in the description below if you want to play a lot let's go and oh it's a nice woolly hats makers feel nice and cool lovely christmas market right um i mean is it going to be germany for sure nurenberger i think it probably is germany uh we can't move around i don't recognize this church but we're definitely in a church square where else can we go there's another it's loads of awesome looking buildings all right so look at these signs um stone student [Music] stopple champions so um i'm a little unsure maybe it's a german market but in somewhere else it's not holland is it i don't know no this building doesn't ah i am blaming the hat already it's very tight it's um my brain's not able to engage uh i think it's got to be germany so let's go with it being germany nice square beautiful old church um i think it's a big city though what did the i mean is that an a place for cheryl i'm not sure i'm gonna put that in the corner though who knows who knows not me that's for sure it could be austria i had this in the other game didn't i right make a decision i am going to look around austria and germany yes and see if i can find somewhere called this i don't think that is the name of the place um otherwise a nice square with a big church yeah yeah it's totally what i'm gonna do i'll speed this up and i'll be back okay i'm gonna stop looking this is i'm never gonna fight um i've been trying to look at various squares around germany all of them look so possible but not quite right it could be anywhere any obviously ah so i think i should stop here i've chosen leipzig because there is a nice square there that has a market but i really don't think it is i'm hoping it's not too far away from it though so we won't do too badly on points but let's find out oh it's not did i not look in nuremberg maybe i did not because yes okay but yeah like i said not too far away next city right just about okay oh come on hat maybe this is my lucky hat no not quite okay not too bad did you guys recognize that square and that church i mean it's quite a recognizable area i would say hopefully i'll remember if that comes up again wouldn't place bets on it all right let's try the next one okay there's some a variety of hats uh all the same type like this one no um being given a guided tour by spiderman is that what i'm saying oh oh right oh my god i don't think this is a convention i think this is a stag and hender or something so we've got a joker over here that the incredibles one of the presidents uh buzz lightyear don't know who this guy's supposed to be maybe to know cool all right peer head restaurant and bar i feel like this is like north north scotland or something um maybe this is the only pub in town johnson travel wonder woman over here um right they timed the google car going past well didn't they oh god that poor bus driver oh nobody wants a hindu like that coming up and do they right let's see um so definitely the uk um but the question is where oh no on the first sea farm i don't know that's the name of the place i mean it's got to be one of the islands i would say shetlands or something like that um it's lovely that is literally all there is here i guess that's a quick look up this hill shall we more little houses dotted about nice little community zoom zoom zoom snake up the hill more houses uh i want to get right at the top of the hill see what we can see nice so it is official coverage so we can rely on the compass so to the north west out to sea and i see a lovely road sign up here thank you very much no don't go ah what are you doing right lerwick hillswood north isles hmm this sign down here should tell us where we were look lower though ace and bixter some b road numbers all right let's use this one though one more okay so scotland islands itchy nose sorry right so either islands or some of these weird cracky bits up here um hills wick and lurwick hills working lower oh there's little wick cool that wasn't too bad and [Music] where did it say some cool places up here um all right so this is the a970 which i guess goes across the whole island um there's larwick i don't think it was any of these was it so we go back down to this one because my brain obviously can't remember anything lower though on the b b9 b9071 lower though we can find this we can find this i can't see any road numbers that's why i'm not using them north row so there's avo salimbo loevo there's another vo right this is this is cool um what else is there ace and bickster let's start it that's right oh bixter is there okay getting there there's ace i'm sorry it took me a little minute to notice that name it's a it's an interesting place now okay so ace is here this is b9071 just glancing past um let's see eris no that was not would be nine zeroes out to bixter as endpoint so go through eighth to get to bixter so we follow this up this has got this has got to be the lower vote that it's talking about then right that's the 970 says shetland room sorry he's gotta be here no unless that pub's gone now um huh no i'm confused papa little rose sound i mean it's got to be that one i can't see it this is the a road what do you say i want to get this spot on i'm sorry guys i'm gonna try get this one spot on louisville soft loft bod yeah see though coming into though on this a970 so you turn off to lower though right see if we're going north so we turn off here so another road that comes up why is it looking about like this ah that can't be the road it's talking about that joins on so i'm not a bit confused no it is down this road so we've got to be down here let's go back to the beginning little pier pier head restaurant and bar [Music] this has got to be along here i mean unless i'm being completely dumb and missing something spectacularly obvious it's got to be this road so i'm just gonna pop it there and let's see okay sorry that took me so long i expected the bar to be on the map but it wasn't but we got there in the end and we've got a perfect school just right let's speed this along for the now swans ordinary baseball cap going on here where are we poland um think we're looks polish but i am no expert as we all know uh all right let's see if we can find some city or town name all poll let's see what else we can see park it lawyer maybe i t lawyer um [Music] come back have a feeling or a useful sign what that looks like dot pl to me i think we are in poland just gotta work out where um what else can we go by carry on down here road signs say you yeah dot pl cool thanks tree god um i feel like that's going to give me the town name but not gonna not gonna see it oh what's this building say what huh it's a cloudy energy company i guess uh jumping around here a lot fast moving trying not to spend too long on this game um i feel like this is again giving me some kind of information of where we are so i'll just have a look at poland i am no good with poland though um it could just be a list of stuff okay i'm gonna have a look a little bit longer so i don't know that anywhere down here is going to give me anything else so i'm going to go back down here sit down this road no i was a church excuse me this way thank you um and see if that gives me anything is it this way nope sorry guys uh we've been too fast it's been down here then oh my lord come on it wasn't down here but let's see is that a football team thing not that i would be able to tell you okay yes place um i really am absolutely clueless on this and a little bit sleepy because the heat um why aren't you moving move right here's some more stuff uh there's a phone number no address i mean why would you have your ass on your shop when you're there so you should know where you are right all of this could be telling me something um well none of it could be telling me anything no that's not because i don't know just don't know oh where'd i go just wish i could say for certain that's the town i'm looking for um no there's a place called bent is a there might be this is not going to go well let me know [Music] if you knew instantly what those signs was giving us a name because i'm sure one of them must have i just don't know what i'm looking for in a name for poland i need to have something to look for though or i do just plunk it somewhere at least i've confirmed that we're definitely in poland so that's a start i mean it's one of these oh didn't mpgk catalyst ah he bins to the rescue all right so it might be a suburb we are in um it's quite a big place i don't think i should just look around for those road signs that might take some time okay let's go back to the beginning so we're in a big park oh place signs here and there's quite a few big parks okay so um never got the park name did we oh it says there park something park no no i'm gonna go up there park no okay i'm going with that this is what i'm going to use to find exactly where we are um so yes i'm gonna speed this up i'm gonna look for that and i will be back i know i said it wouldn't take long but i feel very close with this one okay well that didn't take long here's park bogoki um and we are on the corner of this one yeah here i think we started about there didn't we let's see we're right on the corner right on the corner here yes yeah around the corner of the park france says francisco which is this one but i think i think we're on that one all right let's go with it let's see good 12 yards very nice very nice thank you very much baseball catman let's see what the next hat is oh pink one in the middle of nowhere lovely right gonna go by tree knowledge which i don't have this looks like a bunch of christmas trees technical term for a fur tree i guess right um so we've got what a river down here is that railway line looks like a railway track there um it's taken by sammy kaijan ko so they could be on holiday nice pink beanie going on um so compass i don't know if we can trust but i don't know i guess the sun's there maybe i don't think that's going to help so my options canada north usa i guess um new zealand but i don't feel like it's new zealand sweden anything along this line i guess really um it could be russia gosh i might just because the name i might go along here somewhere maybe estonia not really sure what estonia looks like countryside wise um but i presume it would be the same kind of trees maybe this little part of russia here is it look like a massive woods it's fairly big um yeah i am going to i'm gonna go with estonia it doesn't come up a lot just because i think it'll be fun but i'm going to be sensible and look for a train track because that is a train track right was it just a log road it could just be a foot pass am i being silly yes feel free to tell me that in the comments um should i do it should i do it near russia because i have a feeling it might be in russia there's a sign for a tree there's a trade line there's a train line that goes all the way through the woods that's some woods i guess so should i do it there should i do it here is it like a foot pass i guess train line right away i might i might go here no wait there's water hmm but is that just bog rather than a river and there's water here look i'm going to go here i might regret this let's see let's go i was just inside finland right okay just in finland so very close to the russian border so if i'd gone this area that would have been cool wouldn't it but look just straight across the water there the gulf of finland so look yep not gonna pronounce that but there's that train line so it was a train track so that's good it is kind of a weird boggy thing going on here okay all right i looked at some trees and uh found roughly the right area so i'm very impressed with that and you know using the help of the name of the person took the photo all right let's try last round is this the hat we're going with that doesn't seem right get some more hats here though another baseball cap someone falling over what is that i don't know we'll go look in a minute right but i'm thinking south america um because we've got nice road knowing there's these electric things on the outside and obviously the buildings so maybe we're in mexico but i'm not sure is that the flag just bits of paper i don't don't know what that is um okay let's see what's going on over here in this park it's gone maybe this guy on that bike fell over let's go with that let us go with that now that's a place name i've heard of um cannot remember where it is oh that's embarrassing where is it i don't think it is oh man let's just show myself up left right and center here guadalupe where are you myself stuck on guatemala there let's see be nice to get this hat off because it's really tight um guadalupe i think it's fairly sizable am i gonna have to speed this up just for me to find a place that i really should know where it is i really should know what country it's in well that's very embarrassing right um yes i know all shouting at me but i can't remember ugh okay it's an island what is wrong with me what is wrong with me okay so found the right country let us find where we are so i guess capilla that guadalupe means just taxis of guadalupe um is this the center central place okay let's see what else we can find i was gonna make my around to the church don't think we can no valley that validate to the place so now a bit so quick look and then i'll move around some more and does it encompass these other islands i don't know nice place okay let's go back here let's have a look around some more um i really wanted to see this church i'm not going to get any signs away from the church uh milky mitch interesting milky mitch calidad so that's that name again hmm i am in the wrong place i'm gonna be in the wrong place aren't i okay i am going to speed this up i'm just going to have a look for this street this square um must be able to find that on the map i'll look at the bigger places obviously capilla okay so maybe kapilla is a place are we actually on this island oh right i'm gonna have a look around and see what i can find i've got to find something it's got to be something that i can go with and i will be back in a bit okay so i gave up with guadalupe quite quickly because it looked too french i came back to mexico had a look around the picture some more and i found a van that had uh this place what is it called where is it this place san ignacio on it so i found this place i just can't find the town we're in there are a few places where guadalupe in their name here but not the one we need to find of course so see guadalupe de los reyes and there's another one over here somewhere but i just can't find our one so i might just plonk it around here somewhere oh that's so annoying i thought i could come a lot closer to this but maybe i can't my hat is not helping i might have to throw it away this is not the place right yeah okay definitely not this place so they're driving from here they can't look on too far could they i mean maybe i'll just plonk it in this guadalupe here i think that's the best what we got here just some mountain roads right um okay this place it's a bit bigger um maybe i'll pop it here so i'm hesitating on this it feels like it's close maybe i've just not seen it all right i need to stop where's that place here okay let's just do it here i'm not even going to zoom in i'm going to pop it there and let's see how far away we wow all the way down here there it is guadalupe so i was right first of all it was mexico um which is a nice surprise for me um but just couldn't point it i found that van name up here and that was it for me i just stuck around there i should have moved should i move some more never mind i think it has to be quite yeah zoomed in to see the name but never mind that's not too bad right country take it every time right how do we do it in the end 22 232 well that's better than my last game that was quite a distance this one was quite a distance but everything else not really that bad very happy very happy with that definitely yay nice game better school get him back into it i think which is really nice um but let me know how you get yeah i'm tired and hot now let me know how you did in the comments below um please make any suggestions for any maps you want me to play which means you also get to play those maps um i might do the zoo one again next tuesday because i enjoyed that one but let me know um and yeah thank you very much for watching and i'll see you next time ", "locations": [{"round": 1,

"hello welcome back to another geography along welcome back to another heatwave uk it's still hot but i'm going to see that as an extra layer to the challenge of playing geoguessr and to the challenge of playing the challenge of one of my subscribers so helena has created this challenge for me which says wait that place has coverage doesn't scares me scares me a little i have to say so um we will see how well this goes it should be an interesting map the last one they made i think was for zigzag and that was really fun really enjoyed it so um let's see how we get on with this one shall we i'll try not to complain about the heat and sweating too much during this game um yeah maybe i'm acclimatizing to it we'll see right let's play this game i'm not going to set any uh defaults it's just going to be open to give us the best chance possible uh oh no let's not start let's set this as a challenge and i'll invite you guys so the link will be in the description below if you would like to play along and let's see well we are um cool polo circles so are we well are we in the polar circle are we in the arctic ah [Music] don't no cool cats here no the camera might shake in a minute his bulk might disturb the camera there he goes sits right on the tripod um i don't know there's much else to go on here i mean how i'd have such an expensive camera just out in the water like that i mean it looks like the water's coming to the boat which i don't think it has i think it's just the camera as i used to like uh to blur it out they've copied part of the seed put over it i don't know very strange okay um i've got a compass here i don't know how to read that let me know in the comments if that helped you guys out being able to read this here i'm sure it would mean something to somebody and hopefully it will help somebody but we are looking for an inlet a lake um something i mean i might be being dumb if the polar circle is up here or down there i think there is a difference is there but i don't i'm not sure i mean maybe they're up here somewhere because it just doesn't look cold enough to be the antarctic you know i mean oh helena what have you done what have you done um yeah this could be so so bad on points i just could it be down here somewhere near like south well say near south america i mean look how far that is maybe it's ah right i'm gonna go here i'm gonna go around here that's your peachy base i mean we can see fairly large mountains i don't know if it's closed off that way but it looks kind of closed in so you'd see stuff on all sides like somewhere maybe like here no because these sides are close aren't they that could be joined up right turn the keyboard off before he chilled on it thanks boy you're delightful right deception island i'm in his way he sailed okay i just got to go something because i get it right though no i'm gonna oh i'm gonna stick here i'm gonna go for deception island because this is the oh my lord now i can't even talk so let's just pop us here yep should have gone with canada cool zero points for the first round we're on for a good game right no no not the same one again well that stop that's not that's just not um well that's anything that's fair so i'm going to go back and i'm going to start the game again because to have the same round twice in a row it's just not that's not fair so let's try this again so this is the link that will be in description let's start the game um [Music] i mean it looks like iceland to me or maybe greenland again but is it i mean these bright or is this gonna be one of the canadian islands or alaska or oh wow i mean that's doesn't mean anything i don't think hmm [Music] wow wow oh well i mean do i do i don't want to go greenland again oh my first thought was that it's iceland but maybe is somewhere around here like fort russell it's something can we see looks a bit like a bay doesn't it that land over there i think so um and what are these are they manufacturing here you know hum [Music] i'm going to go around here i'm going to go here because that sounds cool good job haven hey you never know um zero points let's see oh that's better that's much better where were we too glue to glue took sorry of them completely failing to say that oh there's some air bnb b b's and hotels and stuff little airport well that's cool bloody fools just gonna see where that is because you never know i might come up again in another game that's cool all right well starting off better than the last one let's hello where are you diving into the unknown am i right wow and that's pretty cool um i guess they're not that deep but who knows how do you tell when you're diving because i can't dive tried it once i just rolled over couldn't couldn't do it um i mean i don't think what they're wearing is going to give away where they are i mean they could have traveled to this place with their gear anyway if i knew anything maybe i could tell from the coral or the fish but i don't know anything so i'm guessing pacific maybe is that air bubbles or is that a group of fish that might be there air bubbles so ah this is going to be a serious plunket okay so i don't see a boat nearby but it could just be over these rocks so it might not be too far away from the coast but the coast could be an island in the middle of nowhere um i wonder if it's the coral sea what are these spots what's that hmm i reckon we're out here somewhere i reckon we're out here somewhere i don't know why wake island look at that i haven't even bothered to detail it probably um i'm gonna go here should i go marshall islands i'm gonna go here wake at all national wildlife refuge because there'll be coral around him no the would that be [Music] come on big brain kicking i mean should i just go coral see all these weird sandbars they look really cool but i don't understand maybe i'll go in the middle of the marshall islands yes oh god don't be where i was gonna go let's see oh wow just as well i came down a little bit for 16 points okay that that really kicked my ass isn't it across the date line uh well it was the pacific just i was in the wrong pacific where where are we pitcain islands adams town look at this place so it was just off the coast so my reasoning wasn't too bad some paul's pool some pools pool is that an actual pool there you go how long does it take to get there do you think it doesn't seem to be an airport i wonder how we get well that's pretty cool another cool one another cool one but uh yeah 16 points wonderful but you guys did you get closer i mean this really is in the middle of nowhere isn't it wow you just wouldn't see anything right oh wow right now this is mars no um can't really see anything don't know what that is that looks like a lighthouse but i don't think it is um let me ponder wha where what where so i guess that's flatland mountainous over there i don't know if we can trust the compass um yes oh did somebody go for a toilet so does that mean there's no tracks what oh is that high up those are cars oh my god we're in the air like really high up wow okay that changes the perspective a little bit um do i guess the sun's over there are we in the northern hemisphere maybe if the compass is right um god knows where though wow those are tiny little cars down here so that's like a sulfur like i don't know what what would make that so yellow so that must be a big feature we can find um what kind of cars they are okay okay i think we might be able to find it we use this i guess must be a lake um so i'm thinking anywhere across this kind of line hmm do i spend a long time licking um [Music] hmm i'm going to spend a bit of time looking around i don't know if i'm going to find this lake though because see it's not going to be appear yellow yellow on the map maybe it won't even be on the map at all but i would think a feature like that in the middle of nothing is there another one over here is that a camp i am gonna go sahara am i is that a bit too obvious is that a bit too obvious i mean this western sahara never comes up i don't know what i think is that is it all right i am going to spend some time looking around see what i can see and i'll be back okay so i'd look around a few places but in iran i spotted they've got quite a few salt lakes i think this one's too big and too close to things but i'm thinking maybe they're likely i mean there's some mountains and there these must be mountains over here right so maybe we're in iran i don't know i don't know i just don't maybe it's too densely populated you know somewhere here would look okay maybe this yellow one just isn't on there no like what electronics store in the middle of nowhere that's fine yeah um i'm really lost to where to go so i'm gonna go here i'm gonna go there oh this is bad i did let's see ah i had a look around china i know they do have deserts here but these didn't see these roads no lake nothing i was looking for was on the map so that's cool 337 all points ah well it's kind of on the right continent so yep yeah damn oh well at least i didn't go america because that would have been a lot worse wouldn't it okay no not again we've got the same round again that happened last time i know there's only 10 locations so i'm not going to skip that one this time um but i think i'll place myself where i went before because i think that's only fair so here we go sorry about that um oh whoa huh it's a different place what now did the picture just not change oh that's annoying but it also worked out well for me but i didn't realize that could happen oh okay hmm cool let me know if you got the same desert picture but this was the pin place um i don't know what happened there sorry um but yeah i'll take a a school that's in its thousands okay last round and we've had this one before that's a shame um but i'm gonna take this one i'm gonna place it near where it was i think i can remember where that is um up here somewhere wasn't it i think let's pop it in there and let's see oh not a perfect scoop there's a little bit of cheat in there i think i think that was because i've had it before so maybe in that first game i tried that when it had that same picture again it was not the point i i don't know let me know in the comments what you think happened and what i can do next time if that happens maybe i should just refresh the page but the uh the cat is on the keyboard so all right let's review our summary so not even 10 000 points oh i'm sorry i let you down but that was a great challenge helena thank you very much you made that really hard those desert ones made me extra hot as well it's very hot here i just can't describe how unnatural it feels being in the uk and being this hot um and if you are in the uk or in europe because apparently it's gonna get hotter than death valley um this weekend do stay cool stay hydrated i would say stay indoors because it's not worth going to the beach and maybe collapsing in this heat is not good um but anyway after that psa let me know how you did in the comments um thank you very much again helena this was definitely a challenge um i'm up for another maybe a little easier or maybe wait until it's cooled down and i can give it a good go um but yeah let me know how you did and thank you very much for watching and i will see you next time still hot and sweaty i'm sure because it's not going away thanks guys bye oh ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 67.8206177, "lng": -115.103981}, {"round": 2, "lat": -25.0744504, "lng": -130.1151408}, {"round": 3,

"foreign welcome back to another geoguessr play along I'm sorry I haven't uploaded for a while you know life happens and stuff happens um I also haven't played you a guesses this whole time so I don't know if that's been detrimental to my progress but we will find out um hopefully I'll be back on track with getting videos out I'm actually on holiday next week but I'm hoping to get stuff recorded before I go I want to let you guys down again um but let's see how it goes as long as it's fun it's it's not a job so just want to have fun with it so it will be when I can um but it's Tuesday I said we'll do animal maps on Tuesdays um 11th I haven't turn around so if I've got your name wrong um suggested maybe doing Kangaroo Island so Kangaroo Island it is I think that's a great idea I have to say the cat is sat on the tripod at the moment so we'll see if he interferes with this recording I've tried to get him off but he's not budging so let's see what happens but let's get into this hopefully my glasses won't steam up it's very hot in the UK right now it's not pleasant we have no air conditioning so let's see how this goes right I'm not going to put any settings on this game I'm hot I haven't played for a while who knows how this will go the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and uh let's see where we are what we get oh so nice sign up there let's have a look around though guess it's in a dome isn't it right let's see what does this sign say it's a very slowly getting up there all all cats are on the move let's move my water before he spills that hey so we're on the b23 American rear and was that say boarding Beach right they were looked at Kangaroo Island before so I'm presuming the schools are going to be very harsh because it's a small area so you're gonna have to point point it really well the b23 is this around here kangaroo hat let's see if we can find Alden Beach so I guess we'll go along the coast do you think it will be noted on here um that's Island Beach Sea Dragon rock that sounds cool um American River American Beach pens your boarding that must be boarding Beach right um so where are we then Golden Pizza there we're facing Southwest right foreign I don't think we're in the town is this not pulled in Beach then does that say something Drive so we can find something dry these roads Elaine that doesn't add up either well I thought this would go a little quicker than this but let's see so American Reverend King's coat let's find those places that's probably the best thing to do um and that's Southwest West so there's American River King's coat King's coat there's King's coat Okay so areas this is not okay is this something that drive you know Frank Road I can't believe this stuck already there's diesel trove shall see if I can get that it's not gonna happen is it see what else is down here I can't believe this has taken me so long I should not spend so much time off to you I guess so this is my lesson I reckon so we're gonna then drowned more to the Southwest there's another lovely sign up here there's something Drive maybe with a double l at the end can we see this one tree B and B do you think that might be on there something Double L Drive I'm gonna get this spawn these I don't think it was that one um was it the fig tree that no no okay here we go vessel Drive I'm gonna find this we're gonna find this dead on I'll probably speed this up by now because I mean Witter away going we're gonna find it it's not great um I'll be back okay uh so there's vessel Drive there's a fig tree PMB so how far back were we let's go back and see if we can see any of those roads coming off so keep an eye out although it's painfully slow what's that turn off that's I guess somebody's house I don't know that that will be noted no it's on the wrong side and we'll be on that side wittering away still here uh okay I don't think there is a turn off there is that turn off there so where did we start getaway map just before that turn off which must be this one a bit of water isn't noted so I think maybe here let's give it a go right further down and lost quite a few points oh I'm sweating my nose sweating already this is not nice okay right so we've got to be a lot more careful with our pinpointing good Dusty Road I can tell this is still gonna go well click click click traffic Hazard ahead okay so let's go south and see I mean are these kind of rows on the map can we rely on that I don't I don't don't know and how long till we find something just trying to head to this Bend and see there's there's anything nothing right so it bends around to the east Southeast that way let's just pop back to the beginning here and go west oh border vial border vowel fail without uh so it's pretty much going this way so there's Cape border all these little roads so that's probably something like that isn't it and not all of them have names oh oh so we need to be this soon didn't yeah um right well I'm gonna speed this up with Board of foul Style yeah I can find him I think that name was somebody's house I moved further up the road and found a sign for uh ravine decastor's Wilderness can I pronounce that um it's in the middle of nowhere I to move more further along this track but I I thought maybe it might be this way but it says a highway maybe highways or dirt roads so I don't know I don't know I don't know much about this place um but I think it's got to be this road so I'm gonna put this here somewhere let's Jump Off Road we've got this big green there's this hike Trail maybe around here maybe around here maybe that's the sign for that house I don't know let's let's give it a go oh oh not bad that was very lucky oh nice I need some water after that oh wow right okay next one I can't read that lovely road lovely signs a bit of a river going on here got to be at a pinpoint this one right come on sign let's say you Harriet Road Ander Mel Maron two-wheeler Creek Maron Cafe Harriet Road let's say you sign South Coast Road King's coat finders Chase I know King's coat is up here where's finders Chase don't know it says South Coast Road yeah South Coast race we're on the South Coast Road this is Harriet Road you've got a river name Harriet River okay that's helpful South Coast Road King's coat Golf Course and that probably says Harriet River oh Road name Jetty Road public toilets camping ground I just gotta film in the South Coast Road so that's the North Coast Road it's got to be down here right South Coast Road so where what was King's coat and filleras something find his Chase okay so maybe we're in the middle um so now we need to look for a river called Harriet Chase is there let's see if we can find this zoomed out get this one done so I can turn off these lights cool down a little um okay let's zoom in then because it doesn't look like we're gonna find it that easily um how much track next track that's the Eleanor River um come on Harriet where are ya nope nope is this gonna be another speed up I think so you know got a name no names here it's handy and now we're in finders Chase so I will speed this up I'll try and Jesse Road Harriet Road and Harriet River Point Ellen golf course there's a lot of things to look for so right found it Harriet Road Jetty Road where's the river then is that it no idea but we're in between the two aren't we let's have a look that's Harriet rode there to the north River Jetty Road there to the South got to be around here we're closer to one than the other probably a bit more close to Harriet Road so maybe up here no River though okay a bit better on points very brutal on the points but it's a small island we knew that would be the case okay nearly there these glasses haven't started steaming up yet which is nice okay so to the Northeast we can see land that'd be Coast here I don't think it'll be that one probably this Point here maybe or this point here probably that point North Cape some houses let's have a look at North Cape we've got a road some roads let's hear a minute because I like it there might be some roads hidden in these Hills Maybe um where shall we go let's go north see if it is this road it wouldn't be that road and probably be this one wait what no maybe this one so if we head to South we should join on to North Cape road so let's have a look why is it moving so slowly I like giant leaps there's plenty of houses and stuff down here another one that goes into the bay these Farms let's carry on okay I gave up going that way going this way see if we can find anything down here I had to give up I'm not getting anywhere down these roads and it's moving so slowly it's just one one stop I can't I can't do it right let's go back to the beginning I'm just gonna go with this road I think it's this road uh so to the North West bending off maybe this way it doesn't make sense does it my brain is not working handing after the Northeast and undoing this road I can't I can't go any further my brain is not engaging obviously maybe it's Turner Drive let's find out let's see I don't even think that that'll look closer oh my Lord oh my Lord oh wow okay I'll go back to my previous video don't play to your guesser when you're really hot and sweating and brain's not working that's not a good idea foreign let's see let's see what we get Another Empty Road with absolutely nothing to go on this time uh which way are we going north or south let's go north looks like we can leap down the road on this one which is nice if you're doing the ones where it goes bit by bit is they Stitch it together or something this looks like a nice long run this road so the car managed to just drive all the way down is it going to be anything down here signs for the bend I think is there a sign coming up there now it's going small steps oh as a dead end come on oh I really need to turn these Hot Lights Off right oh okay we get in there okay try and just Chase we know where that is Kings coat American river we know where that is Airport and seal Bay let's try and find these whoops areas we've got finders Chase to the east does it make sense huh where's seal by the seal Bay oh so maybe we're on this road so an airport around it I want to go direct to domain um Apple hello I mean that looks like the Junctions isn't it what else is down here some more signs that bend sign or a speed sign yes speed sign and these are Bend signs right it's coastlines really right stop giveaway good right Island beehive right silby Flinders Chase yeah it is called Flinders Chase right what's this one say pan Dana pandana is here foreign did I could be a point to that pond on [Music] I'm sorry I don't need to drink more water how's this so insane so that one goes to American River and penshaw Island bee hive pencil American River King's Creek carry on American review turn off when we run this road that would make sense right yes cat agrees with me still can't find this airport I know it's going to be small but I thought it would be on here somewhere what's this beehive about all right let's say we are on Playford Highway quite far down I guess I might go here let's stop back here so the road is going north east at this point I'm going for it was the right Road that's the right Road I'm taking that there I was looking at that thinking oh that's a airport [Music] what a great way to end man I hope you guys did better than me on this what was my final score didn't even get to 20. wow and the cats come to celebrate excuse me don't tread on the keyboard well on that note let me know how you did in the comments below uh sorry again for not being uploading for a while hopefully that will change I was gonna film another video after this but I think I might just go sit in a cold bath and um think about maybe tomorrow but there will be a video out on Friday and another one next Tuesday another one next Friday hopefully I will keep that up um but again this is this is fun and enjoyable and I want it to stay that way thank you very much for watching and I will see you next time bye-bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

"hello welcome back to another geographer play along um 10th ave turnaround has just had suggested doing a dog map so i thought that could be a good series so maybe every tuesday we do an animal related map let me know what you think um i don't know how many there are but why not why not give that a try so for the dog one i found this map which is one of the most recent and has the most locations on it must love dogs um because it's been updated fairly recently hopefully there should be a dog in every starting location so um let's give it a try i don't know if we should do it timed or no moving i think maybe no limits on this first one i mean it could be anywhere in the world so let's let's just dive in and give this a try and hopefully no cats will storm the desk in protest of a dog map being played let's see so link will be in the description below if you would like to play along and let's see what doggies we get okay oh there is a little doggy don't know what kind of dog that is very cute though okay so must be in europe i guess e411 i don't recognize the names of these places um this is quite a lot of flags going on here let's see if i can answer japan so that's it today don't know what that one is not sure germany sweden but anyway let's see where are we don't know let's see another sign over here okay so i mean are we in spain it doesn't look very spanish but i'm not really sure so e411 is probably our best bet are we in france maybe it's france okay let's have a look uh let's see do we have e motorways no we don't so are we in spain or in portugal see we've got e-roads here and e roads here and in green as well so hmm or because i was thinking it would be scandinavia or italy oh gosh somewhere up here all right i think when i see 41 z4 11 come off of this or something there you go there it is now it's gone there it is okay okay and an inroad eros and n wrote i think i'm gonna have a look around europe um this is a candidate isn't it 400's here okay i'm gonna have a look around europe and try and find e4 elephant and um i will be back and hopefully i'll wake up by then i think i found it i'm not sure take a bit of a time and it was france having a good look around at the road numbers so i found the only place that has all of those road numbers is here i found place ryan astrid which is on the side of this church here so i think we've got to be here right i think so i think i've woken up a bit now let's give this a try let's see okay that took some time though not gonna lie that took a lot longer than it should have done okay let's try and be a bit quicker and a bit more concise maybe so dog butt this time talk about um okay this reminds me literally but this reminds me of mexico um [Music] so maybe it's spain i don't know where's the sun okay i don't think i can use the sun so which way are you gonna go this way i think so what's this a pasco okay don't know it might be south america but is that a dollar sign let's continue on i think we're in south america oh god finally this is gonna be let's see if we can find a good sign otherwise it might be a plunket i think we are mexico i think okay so maybe this is the name of a place a waxaca maybe so people might get that web address so we can just check we are in mexico but no i think we are should i try and find a place was that name why not let's have a look a wax a car maybe it's an area oh here yes it is an area okay so we are in mexico um maybe i should have a look at that building again or is it just i mean i presume it's a city and an area so maybe this is fairly gettable let's go back to this building so another name on here we can get oh this is the police station okay so i think atlanta is a place oh am i looking for the lashapasco i don't know okay i think i'm gonna have a scan around because this feels gettable i just wish i knew a bit more about the way mexico labels their streets and stuff because etler looks like a abbreviation to me but maybe it's not i don't know okay i'm gonna look around okay so i found a place with a pasco in the title and etlas all around here i haven't seen that anywhere else but doesn't mean it isn't around somewhere else i just haven't found it um i can't see a train line here so i don't know if this is the right place um [Music] i don't think i want to look around anymore this is too much so um i'm gonna pop it somewhere i mean if i can find a police station that would be great um i haven't seen one it just feels a bit too developed this place looks a bit more rural but i don't know maybe it's out on this the edge here somewhere no idea um here's another etler i don't know what it means so maybe it's just area but i think i'm going to plunk it here somewhere because i don't know where else to look but at least i think we're definitely in mexico and we should be in the right area so it shouldn't be too bad on the score right i think i might pop it here okay let's see that was very close magnolia ah so it wasn't marked on the map that's good about that area ah delek let's look that was on the sign and i was looking for the uh a pascal at the end like this but never mind that was really close so i should have done it here oh i'm happy that is not bad on a mexico round look you see so that's right that is okay all right that's only the second round let's try and get through this a bit quicker look at these doggos oh right where you from dogs are we south america again it's pretty much in the south so we are in the northern hemisphere um [Music] hmm let's have a look at this car pretty beat up car you got in your trunk don't know about your wretch plate i mean i just want to see if we're in europe or not i don't think so i don't think so but let's carry on i mean in this pretty wild place yeah i'm not sure that we're not in europe okay here we go polish flag on there sure it would have a eu stamp so wouldn't it so russia are we in russia huh i'm really confused some more cars what can you tell us not a lot it does look like you know some pretty old soviet cars and then a fairly new japanese car no eu badges i wonder if we are in that area which means potentially awful school really um we carry on down here i don't think we're gonna see much be good to get a road sign get a bit of language maybe not this way though maybe the other way freight train yeah i think maybe we'll go back and go this way nope hey um gotta find something otherwise i will just plonk it you know it's concrete buildings it's got to be in that area come on you're moving thank you this all game again it's your t-shirt have something on it mate some kind of rock band i guess let's catch up with this car there's another russian um japanese car so i'm gonna plunk it and i'm gonna plunk it over this side of russia there's this island or on the mainland a little further up should i just go all in and go on this weird island you reckon that's silly let's do over here somewhere let's do cheetah let's give that a go oh okay i mean for a rush around that's not that's not terrible i mean obviously the points are not great but that's not terrible okay oh quite proud of myself for that one i didn't think she would go near this lake but i sucked my gums and went more towards japan but okay i'm happy with that i'm very happy with that all right let's see fourth round where are we now oh that was cricket this is a beautiful dog look at him so fluffy oh that's cool what's that is that a stadium that's cool all right where are we asia that's a lovely package uh okay i didn't feel like south america dot c t c t huh ctg okay let's look around some more i don't know why i'm so confused about this because san jose caldera yeah we've got to be in south america okay well nationale wrote 27 excuse me 27 let's see so i'm not going very quiet i'm just still very confused about this but i guess it's got to be um san jose with me today it's it's hot again and it's quite early but it's no excuse really is it columbia i think it's the ct that's throwing me off i don't really know where that is and that's something i should know because that's quite a helpful thing to do uh still got 25 again but no 27 um costa rica see this is san jose there's a route 27 okay mata redonda mata redonda 27 okay i think we must be here right i'm sure you're all laughing at me like what what is she playing at there's a big road sign up here and quite clearly south america san jose caldera route 27 i really don't know what was wrong with you i'm so sorry guys so right route 27. does it stop there is it carry on here carries on here um no cat don't don't come up here please i'm so close to the end where's the 27 finished 27 finishes here so something about caldera and there was a park put this here a minute um not on the keyboard my god no you're not going to the window come on don't he's here to stay right so the park is to the north parks to the north there's some things here and there's a stadium i mean come on brain what are you doing why are you mucking about so much where did we start we started here so in between the water and that can we see any parts get off the mic sorry guys um no no don't have cats if you don't have a cat just don't get one no he's lovely um okay let's just put us here i can't see any paths but we can't also can't see the water so maybe here okay let's give that a try okay not bad four points okay good i don't know where my brain was at that one um let's move on to the next one the last round i just cut off you said svm.something so we like i mean these remind me of the ones you see in prague but i don't think is czechia i think in like romania or hungary or something like that just sit don't knock over my water okay okay so what we got here probably something useful but um i don't know put an eu batch there i mean this must tell us the district area if we knew what city we're in oh i didn't even look at the dog there he is a curly haired one no okay so this must be the street and that's a district destin design one or bessin let's have a look at some other signs there should be some more up here right oh that's wonderful uh what okay let's move on sneaky little no one day okay moving on and on and on no signs here [Music] bins what say you it's a destin so i think destin is the city that we are in um not sure what country so um [Music] see i thought romania that's romanian the eu though again all things i think i should know uh let's just have a quick look for destin i might speed this up i'm going to have a look around for a city or a town called destin not how you pronounce it but there we go i found it i found it thanks to this little sign here i found some road numbers um i just check here so we have decent now does it have the numbers that has on the street sign no it doesn't wonderful okay so this photo one now is the root out of desin um so you're gonna go through destin to get to the library and please no good at pronouncing these places [Music] can't find that obviously here okay so we're probably on the other side then around here so let's have a look at the road signs we had a street here we go [Music] right laps good joining with how this one do you think here because this road does go continue round a i reckon we might be there not there here or here we're close to the river right that's going to be the river there and then let's go back up here a minute nope destruction all right we are yeah how going south east so it's gonna be here what why am i questioning this i know it's right let's go okay four points on the last round thank you very much how long did this take us a very long time i'm a rookie seeker nice got a fresh new okay cool uh twenty one thousand six six one okay that's good i mean that rush around wasn't too bad all of these weren't too bad actually all in all i think that was quite a good map thank you for the suggestion how did you guys do on this map let me know in the comments below and maybe suggest what animal we play next otherwise it's going to be a cat you know it is thank you very much for watching and i will see you

"hello welcome back to another geoguessa play along it's very hot at the moment so i'm sorry if you can hear the fan but it's probably quieter than having the window open um so hopefully i won't start sweating too much so today i thought we'd do coast europe as requested by dad city who created this map it seems appropriate for the weather at the moment um i really wish the uk had some air conditioning um so let's see how we do i'm gonna try not to spend too much time in front of these lights in the screen and everything so let's just dive in and give this one a go so the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's try this game okay so this is giving me like maybe scandinavian vibes which way do we go oh we can only go one way well that helps so let's see what we can see it looks like a lake um can we see on the number plate it looks like an eu batch and let's go over here so lots of works going on around here um looks like an eu badge as well i can't really see much in those bins does it look like a lake i think oh flag um no idea but that is uh no i don't know maybe it's a local flag or something all right let's carry on um i don't know what that flag is okay so lakey area maybe in scandinavia see if i can get anything else before i make gas was that a sign get some language i can't really tell um okay right some more signs yeah looks like scandinavia maybe denmark oh we can't get up here um so it's probably the road name isn't it i really can't get up there okay do i carry on down here let's have a quick look let's have a quick look um okay so it's gonna sound weird so we've got a circle one and a blounted oh is that what the two dots are called i'm not sure okay let's have a look so um it does kind of remind me of a place i saw near stockholm around here so i think i might go around here let's put this here a minute brand holmen see that's gonna be austria or something isn't it let's see if i can see brand holmen here there's so many places around here though isn't there so you're going to hear my cat meow quite a lot because they're very hot as well and all they want to do is eat tuna right now uh brand holmen okay i'm not gonna see it i don't think hopefully i haven't just glanced past it no okay so i'm gonna go back to the beginning so around to the south west west mostly so this looks this looks good let's let's try here let's go tell it right country though so i'll take that as a win right up here wow that's cool middle of nowhere okay we'll set the right country i'll take that as a win good right next one i'm gonna ignore the fact that the very low points um okay so there's water over there to the north and all the way around to the south see what this is oh let's not see what that is okay fine looks like another camping holiday area maybe or actual buildings here being built or being torn down not sure got some language right so is that what's cyrillic but who knows where um okay see if we can find some more information i thought there was people looking at the window [Music] excuse me right i don't think that's greek so is it gonna be russia is it gonna be have cyrillic in bulgaria let's see what else there is i presume they're all saying keep out this is my house go away um i don't know if you can find anything else up this road there's some people hey people um so you walk from somewhere let's see you just dropped off here maybe what's this like a hotel or something oh red plates it doesn't look like they've got an eu badge on them so it helps a little bit tennis court or something backyard looks like there's a sign up here no that's just blue hoardings let's follow this car where are you going okay main road does this say i guess that says market yes i haven't studied the cyrillic alphabet yet i know i really need to um i wonder if that says anything that i would find useful okay so too hot to carry on looking um do they have cyrillic in bulgaria i don't know why i think bulgaria i think it's the trees they have some nice lakey areas don't know could it be around here so it's north to the south it could be like here couldn't it here really i'm gonna go for bulgaria because that was my thought um let's go where this photo point is let's see yep that is russia very far away cool and doing really well with this game i hope you guys are doing it just as well make me feel better i'm gonna blame the heat being dehydrated let's have some water hopefully that will help okay okay come on we can do better all right well this is the uk and back on the train maps grange over sands never heard of it what else can we see nice old building um take top award for gin okay gin country ringo right let's see what else we can see here [Music] which way do we go let's go this way that fan probably has some good information on it and it's gone okay we again oh i'll get one grange over sands oh what did that say station yard garage grange over sands there it is we in southwest now i'm not sure okay let's see south lakeland the lakes lake district cranes over sands um looks lovely though south lakeland this is something say another wood fancy okay um i'm sure i could go and find more signs a feeling we might be the lake district said lakeland and this to me is lakeland land of the lakes um but might not be um to cringe over sands i'm not sure now should i go and find a sign that has some road numbers because that's definitely gonna help so you've got like side here about round here it's all very sandy oh grange over sounds nice okay so did we start here let's get a perfect score at least on one of them and it has to be a uk train station doesn't it because that's very appropriate on the corner of the building so probably around here all right let's give that a go nice okay oh brilliant all right next one lots of signs there's good hotel don vasco lisbon i guess north lisboa algarve so north lisbon um pop is here a minute and we've got we're looking south east at the port i guess where's the port it's pretty much in the center isn't it i've got to be on this side so what else we've got here port covo there's a hotel don vasco let's see if we can find that hotel don vasco yes lisbon hotel don vasco i don't think we're up this far are we are we over here i'm so hot it's all you'll hear from british people right now hmm now you go down here lots of jetties that's a long time ago i went to um porto lisbon um okay let's work this out a bit better shall we right so nice bit of walled city okay there's lots of what's the cat's turn hey leave the foundation uh quite strange strange straight ugh row going north east so the coast oh my brain is not working so it's probably along here we are probably along here no because the northeast was into a cove i can't see a bridge can we now i'm very confused i'm liking an inlet okay i'll move i'll move move it along um almost the same can only go in there if you reserved oh there's a little bridge i feel really branded what's this sign say oh okay um don't know oh there's like a little bay so big port thing industrial port things to the south east and sea to the south west i just feel like we're here somewhere i can't see this bridge so i'm definitely wrong maybe we're not in lisbon maybe we're down here let's go back to the signs sorry guys i know i know so that says i'll go the algarve is down here but lizbo is up the coast so [Music] we're down here how far away from lisbon not that far i guess corto covo maybe it's saying to the north as lisbon to the south is the algarve could we be in the middle i know i'm spending too long on this right i'm gonna have a look around if i haven't sped this up already i'm gonna speed this up and find something that looks likely or just plunk it more lightly plunk it i am sweating so much i think i found it his hotel don vasco um where are we sinners so here's the big port thing we can see i guess um so docker's bars up here don't no um restaurant pee something i guess this is a little hot where you are i think we're here i'm sweating too much let's see cool cool all right let's see what the last round brings us um interesting kind of reminds me of the uk but i don't think it is oh now it's sunny no it doesn't remind me of the but at the moment that's a lie um okay we've got two blue badges uh are we in italy can't go anywhere that way san juan plaque girl pm venue we're in france we on the border so we've got the sea to the south west another little port um see what this big sign says yeah so we are definitely in france does that say captain eerie what's up here let's see is that a portal authority or something is there a sign here see okay nothing useful so i think the best sign is probably this one san juan beach right is that what it says and c is basically to the south west france oh i could be anywhere around here can it because my brain's not working maybe closer to italy because of various italian cards all right oh are we called again say joe in um south west is that way really isn't it so maybe we're further around but there's lots of dips okay i am going to look i'm just going to say straight off i'm going to speed this up i'm going to go all along the coast and try and find this beach i'm going to get a perfect score of the last round and i will see you in a bit okay i've only got halfway through i can't i can't go all the way there's too much there's so much coastline so many beaches i think i'm just gonna go with my first instinct and put it near italy what if it's corsica i didn't even consider that oh oh right why didn't they even think of that okay i can have a quick of course it could help that makes more sense does it does it though yeah i'm going to quit around corsica and i will be back okay i can't find it um but i think i'm gonna go of course because somewhere because why not hardly ever comes up um i don't know where i'm gonna plunk it though where where where maybe here there we go let's see do you know i had a feeling it might be at the top and it was just throwing me off and i was right ah okay so no no perfect score for the last round for me seven points right well i don't think i'll uh try and film again when i'm so dehydrated and sweaty and hot that is my excuse and i'm sticking to it 12 762 i feel like i can do better on this map so i'm gonna try it again um definitely when i'm a bit more awake and less sweaty and annoyed and i live in a country that shouldn't be this hot um and hopefully i can get a better school but let me know how you guys did in this one uh did you enjoy the throwback to the old series of the train maps on the round three there so i was happy with those two but i could have done better on the rest really could have done thank you very much for watching hope you're staying cool and hydrated out there uh let me know how you did in the comments below and i will see you next time

"hello welcome back to another geography along and to continue the theme of trying not to do really easy maps i found this one which is official coverage in countries you have never seen in g i guess guesser so that does not sound easy um i'm not sure how hard it's gonna be it says moderate so uh we shall see i predict i don't know probably getting only 9 000 or something like that but maybe we'll be lucky you never know just got to keep in mind that it's probably not a country that i've ever gone to onto you i guess sir oh this is going gonna be hard this is gonna be hard let's get into it let's see so i said it as a challenge the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and uh let's see how annoyed i'm gonna get with this map right okay straight in with a pretty difficult one oh we've got these so i had a game like this it was plunkett or something i think and they had flags like this now that was i can't remember the name of the country i'll go to it on the map in a minute um it's beautiful out here though um can i remember what country is am i only thinking of the country i thought it was in which is probably wrong yeah mountain over there amazing amazing okay let's go a little bit further and see what we can see i'm sure there's not going to be anything that helpful it does look is it the same place i had on that map huh look at it look at that that would be amazing but i don't think i'll be able to hike all the way up there right now i think it was around here somewhere um oh and the cat's here because somebody's delivering something um hmm put it around here official coverage in countries you've never seen ontura guesses have i seen the pool on georgessa have we seen nepal not sure [Music] there's obviously a lot of mountains around here um i'm gonna go from nepal now i don't think it's mount everest we're looking at or is it maybe it is let's have a look here so we're looking to the east ish sun hmm maybe we're i can't make a decision maybe we're over here or something let's go let's go near a resort because these guys don't look like they're in big climbing gear or anything let's go here let's see let's see if we're anywhere near where it is oh internet don't do this to me now i want to know how close i was come on come on you can do it okay try again yes come on come on not again sorry guys um this is not working gonna do it this time no all right hold on guys i will be back let's see what the internet is doing i don't want to lose this guess and the internet seems fine so i'm going to try again um see okay i don't know what happened there but cool okay you weren't that far out awesome so what's everest we're looking at maybe or some other mountains okay everest viewpoint look here oh that's a good one to remember cool good nice start let's see what if we can keep that up ah okay so maybe some kind of dig site look over here is it roman or looks like a christian church over there people wandering around see there's any signs give us some language awesome right so yeah so christian site i guess um hmm wheely bin interesting turn my keyboard off before the cat jumps on it all right boy where you going yep there you go knock everything off no don't go no come on come over here over here it's very hot today i don't like it okay let's see what so you can know okay can't go over there um okay what we've got here this looks like some mosques um i don't know i guess you've got to be middle east somewhere right um so christian middle eastern okay son where's the sun son there you are right above us i reckon so okay so i first thought maybe syria or somewhere like that damascus could be but it's places you've not been to one g i guess sir i mean how often does syria come up jordan's an option around there's a lot of history everywhere that really helps does it um about kuwait i get a lot kuwait here hmm so i don't really have a feel for it oh hey guys you're a security man just trying to see what this yellow sign here doesn't i'm not like i'm not gonna be able to read that away um oh number plate doesn't help me i don't know i don't know number plates so this is a hard one can i oh tour bus is gone no i thought there might be some writing on the side okay gotta make a guess got to make a guess where would you guess where have you guessed what did you do i mean i've seen israel i'm sure i've seen lebanon i'm just trying to think what's the less lesson gone to is it that's my words all right let's have a look back at some language here oh abu mina city okay that's helpful maybe um so it doesn't look ah i didn't look cracky trying to figure it out by the writing now so so i think maybe it's around here um abu mina i don't know if i'm gonna be able to see that i'm gonna have to be quite zoomed in to see that i reckon oh yemen yemen doesn't come up a lot man so many options gonna have to plunk it somewhere um i'm gonna i'm gonna look to see if i can find abu mina i think i've got a sign i don't know how much harder this map's gonna be so i think we were spending a little bit of time looking for abu mina city so i'm gonna do that and i'll be back okay obviously i've not found it i still don't think in yemen but also maybe some of these islands it could be i think i'm gonna go with a rack i don't know why there's some abu places here um a lot of stuff going on i don't i don't know i have an absolute narrative so let's try this plonk and see where we are really egypt i did not even think about egypt for sure egypt comes up a lot doesn't it i guess it doesn't i'm not really sure but there it is here we are in egypt wow well there you go not great on points either [Music] never mind all right let's see what we got next hopefully i won't spend so oh god we're in a volcano oh god oh god okay now are we in no wow um cool all right can we get out of the volcano official coverage in a volcano amazing all right let's see how far we can go go around is that a way out let's see need to get to higher ground that's pretty cool though now i presume it's a volcano all this smoking vents and things no no are we stuck in the volcano let's have a look at the crater then i need i guess they're not going to get too close to the uh hot gases probably a quite toxic all right so pick a volcano i guess see if we can go this way yes no this one oh there's a shot cool so a fairly active volcano with a crazy person who said yes i'll take some official google footage in a active volcano because that's what people are searching for on google yeah i don't think we're getting out of here are we let's keep trying a little bit longer and see i think we're just going sideways now look at that it's pretty cool though isn't it okay where [Music] what volcano shall we choose i really can't get an idea from the rock or anything um so can we see the sun i guess the sun might be over there i don't know yet no idea on the sun um is it there i don't know i don't think i would trust that so i suppose the shadows here some must be behind us okay i am going to go there's so many volcanoes um god this could be zero points um i don't know i can only think european ones right now and i don't think it is european i'm gonna go for tenerife [Music] i don't think it's effective oh i don't know now [Music] what does it say on here where exactly is it sure is in the middle of the island that's an observatory telescope is it here active volcano with a cable car i'm gonna go there because i can't think of any others right now and god knows where it is so let's go right of course thinking around australia but didn't know about this one which one are you um ambrim ambrim big lava lake small lava lake and a big fat zero points yay wonderful oh never mind let's move on let's move on from that okay where are we now um okay i mean tell or something oh he doesn't come up often but it does come up and because it reminds me of japan but it's not japan so that makes me think taiwan right um let's see what else is uh it's definitely chinese hmm do we try and find some signs in english which i very much doubt there will be um so that means mountain i believe that looks like it could be a very useful map if i could see it a hmm [Music] interesting yeah that's a cool rock yangsha road okay yangsha road cycle route is an island it's had an island there's taiwan plenty of islands around here so one that looks like that though uh that looks like that okay um um maple woods let's see if we can find maple wood cycle route um what's the name of the road young shoe [Music] some woods kidman forest what did it say maple woods let's see if we can find maple woods might have to be a bit more zoomed in i guess um we'll find another sign at least we know where we are so we're in this island i guess chinese island um lots of trails i mean lots of these places have the mountain symbol um i put that's what we looked at already protection park military brothel okay interesting um okay i think if i can find some more signs we've got a good chance of pinpointing this one um right i'm going to look for some more information so it's yang yang show road um i don't know this map says you are here or anything like that i'm going to be able to see it oh oh so oh that's not the whole island though is it i could be up here okay i'm gonna look around and try and find a town name or something we're on yangsha road um i'm gonna be able to pinpoint this i yes it's gonna happen so i will be back okay so i found a school which was down here this anneland primary school so this is the the rhode yangsha road whatever it was so i went back to the beginning and i went the other way and found this road sign which is this road it says that way so i presume it just means that this row carries on round um another one carries on down that way so i think we started on this road i just i'm not really sure where um so i mean we can't get too hard with points on this really can we i'm gonna go for here because we didn't go too far until we got to this road so yeah i'm gonna go there and let's see how close we were just on this other road i was thinking about going there but never mind we've got four points amazing that's amazing lucky those sony bus stops with those signs on figure out where on this island there you go there's a part of china that is covered by official coverage it's a very interesting place i like it all right we on the last round we are okay so we have pyramids does not mean we're in egypt although we've already had one in egypt so maybe they've decided that we don't know there's official coverage in egypt i don't really sure let's see what we can see i mean there's quite a few pyramids here i'm not sure this is the geezer is that the place um we were near alexandria on the other route so [Music] i'm back in alexandria again i hate it when it goes this little steps so i want to have a look at this city here so the city is in the east to south east get out here please further please go on okay so there's a decent road it is set up for tourists look so huh all right i guess we're alexandria again oops i want to see the sign show me the sign okay let's go let's go egypt alexandria um and so the city was to the east but to the south sea so maybe it's not alexandria it's got to be egypt maybe nero cairo um yeah some pyramids here there's some more pyramids black pyramid i don't think okay i thought this was going to be easy not as easy as you first think is it me right okay so yeah we're definitely in egypt um i was hoping to be able to see some of the signs can we go on this road carrying on this road are you gonna take us off that way yeah let's see that sign there god damn it okay oh no cool that's just rules no touching and stuff she's fair enough it's very ancient monuments um okay okay because i think it's these pyramid gardens here i think it's different ones but which ones maybe it is maybe it is these ones let's put this here a minute i don't know why i don't want to go there i mean there's plenty of other places i'm sure i thought alexandria had this big complex as well or am i remembering that wrong i can't see anything i know i'm not very zoomed in very zoomed in my words today huh um anything around here internet gonna be funny again awesome awesome right nothing around here no okay cairo it is come on not on the last not the last round um um i might go here because i'm not sure which pyramids we're at all right let's do it i thought god that's really close isn't it so we were in giza giza well that showed me in it but this is supposed to be places that we do we've not had come up before and i've had this come up never mind got a good points got it got any good points what's wrong with me today we got some decent points for that one so let's see what did we finish off at okay average score for this that one though i knew i should have gone over this way but i couldn't think of any volcano so i didn't know where to go but they're all over the place aren't they never mind i got more than 9 000 i predicted so awesome i'm very happy with that very happy with that i'm very happy with this one my perfect score one luckily to see that shape of the island so and me thinking it was taiwan helped so that was lucky so at least i got top score on one of them i mean yeah can't really complain how did you guys do i mean did you do better than me with the volcano bad bad bad let me know how you did in the comments below how did you figure out some of these that i just didn't especially those egypt ones those those annoyed me a bit to be honest but never mind not as bad as i thought i hope you guys did better than me um this was really fun a bit more testing than my usual maps still not you know too hard i don't think because i didn't struggle as much as i thought i would and hope you guys didn't too but let me know how you did in the comments thank you very much for watching and i'll see you next time ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 27.826169967651367, "lng": 86.66438293457031}, {"round": 2, "lat": 30.8411922454834, "lng":

"hello welcome back to another geoguessa play along and after having done so many uk-based maps i thought it was about time we did a world based map and what better than the classic mapper map an urban world so traditionally it takes me quite a long time an hour and one minute to get 24 991 so very close to a perfect school still not a perfect score yet and i'd like to bring that time down but i'm not that helpful so we'll see we shall see so let's get into this game i said it as a challenge i'm not going to set any limits it's going to be a nice casual game and let's invite you guys link will be in the description below if you would like to play along and let's see where we are so this looks like usa um so that's nice and gentle for the beginning but i still gotta find out what city or town we're in so east state north liberty uh any recognizable buildings i don't think so it'd be useful to get some kind of uh state road numbers i think is the easiest so look what we got here so east state street and this is eastern sanderson company i thought that might have a town name jacksonville center of the arts right um it's down here somewhere isn't it i don't know for sure though here we go i knew i saw it somewhere down here but is this the right one i'm sure there might be other places called jacksonville um right so we were on east state street and what were the other ones liberty north liberty east state so east state is going west we've got a river over here is that what's happening over here let's have a look is this a river no don't look like it does it okay so town central downtown looks to be north westish so might be over here um [Music] or on the other side of the river i'm presuming this is a fairly big road but maybe it isn't okay so i am going to probably speed this up that's an interstate road so that wouldn't have a name would it oh that has got a name hmm okay okay i'm gonna look around for hoping to find it so you've got east state street so this is west state street and look around for those and liberty north liberty and i will see you in a bit okay well that doesn't take long so here's east state street and there's north liberty street let's pop us here a minute so let's have a look at this junction up here and what have we got north market where is that then here so must be here right so let's go back to the beginning so on this weird junction lots of stuff happening uh we're on this side i guess is there another very strange junction so i think we're on this side yeah it must be on this side of it around here let's give that a try cool good all right so off to a good start let's try the next one okay so stop it's not it's like cambodia's flagrant ah me and flags honestly let's try and get some more it is cambodia okay cool where in cambodia though who knows um don't know cambodia very well guessing there might not be a lot of street view in cambodia so this people's parties had quarters maybe so maybe capital all right let's see where am i going let's see what we can see so it doesn't look that busy so that's what puts me off it being the capital but maybe this is just a stupid type of day or a particularly quiet area um battambang province do we have provinces on here very much doubt it oh ah well that's handy okay okay so okay mark there just in case it loses me so that's telecom cambodia and we had the people's party the cats have just done something in the knock something over um is that the name of the street maybe oh i don't know um let's have a look down here oh there's a museum so i just see museum okay maybe we can find the museum there's a national museum but it's there a minute are we next to river probably okay okay okay so we started off a disjunction here this triangular part that's probably it i think what else is there that we could look for oh yeah there's a big park so dragon peace garden do you think that's here i think that's what this is well i don't know how we tell but i think that's probably where we are so let's go back on this corner here so i think maybe there yes oh this is good lovely right getting excited okay um where are we now tunisia another flag lovely so we're in tunisia but again what city uh okay so fairly busy let's see what this sign here says bureau post don't know how lucky we're gonna get with there's gotta be some road signs somewhere or something okay we can do this let's have a look down here tunisia bank um no there's a road name which is handy do i recognize this place i've been to a couple of places in tunisia but it's a very long time ago um i want to go over there okay let's carry on down here so it's shopping center i thought that was a hotel um come on we're going to find something i might speed this up because i'll take a while trying to find some useful sign i don't want to go straight to uh seuss or tunis or the other place is there a place without ending i think so hmm it's an email address is that a place name it's not a place name here look that is a place name okay pop is here this is maison de la culture you think that's the heritage mission could be could be oh we saw a street sign was it this i know it was habib something i think it was that one okay right let's go back uh where did we see that street sign oops okay uh let's go back to the beginning so we're outside telecoms which seems to be the most helpful buildings at the moment in this game going up to a roundabout in the east so we have roundabouts noted on here or there's a shopping mall there's lots of shopping malls there i think it could be this one no because there was a monument in the middle i thought that might be on the map somewhere um okay this one there's one that's dual lanes actual lanes and that's a single lane do you think it's this one like we're here somewhere so that was a telecom place that's not on here car park i don't think so okay i'm going to figure this out i will probably speed this up i'm going to look for a road sign off of one of these roads um is that a mosque some kind of fort mini souk okay i'm gonna i'm gonna figure this out and i will be back i found it personally i nearly gave up there but i realized that this building is a post office i was like i saw that somewhere so here's rapid post and then we've got the mini souq up here which is this building here and we started off around the corner in front of junior's telecom so this has got to be where we are come on for another full point right could it be could it be let's try it yes okay okay all right looks like we're in asia again um lose it on the last couple of rounds where are we that's a very interesting monument um [Music] sure malaysia i am not sure thank this keith's house um show me the map no okay fine fine uh there's lots going on not here or indonesian english tea house and restaurant okay so back over here like look at this area yeah that's not not helpful okay so let's see what this sign i says it's malaysia but it could be philippines could be indonesia i think i'm gonna be lucky and suddenly see it again okay look around for some more clues or maybe a flag or something it's over here um okay more please more information what do you sand the can it's that malaysian flag i think that's a malaysian flag okay uh do you think songs use the name of the town okay i'm going to not find anything because that's not really helpful but i know i'm definitely in malaysia so let's go back i don't know which is a bigger place to look for um it's over here it's down this road are we on the coast looks like we are on the coast okay so that's helpful that is very helpful so all right map i'll get to you in a minute so so that is to the south so maybe we're around here or something oh it could be this sticky outy bits they're everywhere okay well it's still you know a little helpful can i get over here no okay okay i did it what's that sign traffic lights cats are freaking out okay what's this another sign for some more tourist things i guess there we go so now we're in the center of wherever we are i guess all right i've got to look for something so i will definitely speed this up um i'm not sure these are road names or towns there's another sign here okay here's quite a lot of signs so i'm gonna look for some of these places and uh on the south east coast and i'll be back oh my god so the cat just dropped my keyboard but it wouldn't have mattered anyway because i was in completely the wrong country where was i i was so well i spent all that time looking around the wrong place i had figured out that those names were road names not actual places thanks cat you saved me a lot of heartache there wonderful right okay cool so perfect score around the window uh really bad score coming in let's see what we get for the last round right mombasa i'll say that like i know where it is kenya okay cool thank you uh all right kenny's down here isn't it it's really throwing me off so bad so bad okay let's get this one let's at least get something on the last round so south coast branch ambassador branch a a kenya okay barclays bank and we're on quite a big road going north west south east could it be this road oh like this right um [Music] excuse me so a a is probably the a i have signs let's see let's see maybe we could get a road name it might be helpful i feel like we're on that road but yeah who knows i think that's my central part uh so south east is going to be maybe this one right but i'm questioning myself because i obviously don't know anything i'm actually not very good and then completely all out of sorts now so come on concentrate right i can do this so there's a football thing and an aaa thing and we can definitely move around and get some more clues so barclays a.a uh football federation um hotels obviously but they're not always on their total carriage ah kenyatta avenue cool so that's road name which is very helpful kenyatta avenue so i am going to look around for that i'm going to speed it up i hope i hope it doesn't take too long but i'm going to find this road i can at least get a good score on the last round which is typically the worst okay so i found tanaka road which almost sign here there's the total service station on kenyatta avenue uh where's that i don't i don't know doesn't matter we are here automobile association of kenya barclays bank is that exactly where we started just a bit down from it so maybe around here between that and the total station so maybe here let's give that a go okay so just one round i don't know how long i would have spent looking around in the wrong places the cat hadn't jumped in the keyboard so i'm thankful to her for that but let's see 21.528 okay i don't think it was too bad obviously this was not good they were quite lucky with a lot of the signs um overall not too bad it's been a while since i've played one like this so yeah i'm happy i am happy with it let me know how you guys did did you muck yourself up here as badly as i did didn't even think to look over here uh always forget but never mind that's that's the lesson learned next time next time uh yes

"hello welcome back to another geography play along and to celebrate bryson being 9th 9th in the premier league uh i thought we would try all 158 english football clubs again so last time we got well i got 24998 because that one in kent was in the wrong place it's definitely in the wrong place so let's try it again and see if we can get full score it's got to be doable other people have done it we can do it too let's not put putting any limits on this game it's invite you guys link will be in the script in the description below if you would like to play along and now let's see where we are this is that round that the point was in the wrong place last time right now i think it put us up further up this driveway if i lose two points on this like i did last time i will not be happy right come on dover let's be having yeah so where was it again is it this one yes it was this one i think it put this like over here or something do i risk that again [Music] because this is crab apple drive um if i lose points on this i couldn't be happy all right shall we uh shall we see unless this is the road oh now that's a twist did i look at that road last time i don't think i did ooh ooh okay now i can't remember okay so we are facing south east ish selfish maybe is this road here i'm gonna move down this road and see well there's sign up here look this is where the road splits that's where maybe that's what i didn't get last time maybe i can't be annoyed maybe it wasn't the right place well we're still on this road though i risk it i'm sure we're there because we can't go in there and see can we i don't want to be annoyed but let's let's give this a go ah see now i lost more points why okay if i ever get this round together i can destroy my new computer this is what happened last time i knew it was okay means i can't beat my last score but we can still have fun we can still play a nice game let's see what we have next let's not think about it anymore right leads is it should be fairly easy to pinpoint although i don't know exactly where in lead it is but we should be able to see the stadium symbol how far out though i don't know there it is now do you guys think that this symbol looks like a whale to me it looks like a whale i know it's a symbol of a stadium but it looks like a whale i swear right anyway uh we here the centenary pavilion yes can we see the [Music] statue because that's over there somewhere we are on the corner so we're probably here just on the corner of the building see the curve going around let's see this pointer is in the right place good correct correct next one i'm not going to forgive bloody dover okay now we are stuck at a football pitch can we read much not really that truly truly football club now i say that like i know where truly is i think it's truly looks like c-h-o-r-l-y right he's lovely photos that are blurry okay let's find charlie where is charlie i mean that's horny maybe it's new maybe that's why it rings a bell i'm sure there's a place called chorley but i don't know where charlewood okay i will probably speed this up have a look for julie and if i can't find surely then i have read that wrong i'll see you in a bit found surely i was obsessed with it being down south i don't know why this has got to be the place right football club football club here we go right so we're right in the middle of the pitch which i presume is sickness so do we just put it right in the center wow that's a strange siren you know what that was sorry about it okay got to be there right come on lose points for that yes why was i i swear it was down south but it's not oh so glad i persevered trying to find that and gave up looking around this house okay i know perfect score is out the window but i still want to do fairly well uh but still enjoy at the same time so relax chill out what is this sutton and team limited team it's another place i've heard of i obviously don't know where it is i don't know where anything is apparently so um okay let's have a look over here and club shop cool what club just lots and lots of um adverts oh here we go sutton united fc and their ladies team cool right so um something come on brain it's up here somewhere right uh i'm sure it's up here somewhere all right we can find this can we find this without having to speed up i reckon we had to see this zoomed out won't we said home county so that's down here isn't it like this area is that the home counties okay i guess we're going in for another long search um i'm so surprised i haven't seen it already i bet i've just glanced over it overnight says cluster and cheltenham okay okay we will have a look around uh where is the other place it said because maybe i can spot that to cheam okay probably not probably not so i am looking for sutton i found a saturn i'm not sure this is the right one though green lane that's where that place is i don't think that's the right one is no it carry on okay so i forgot i could move about a bit more which i did but then i saw these signs and realized the phone number is 0208 which is a london number bloody london so i went to london and here is sutton ah apparently there's more than one saturn in the uk which uh was not not fun not fun at all so we were probably around here i'd say uh gander green lane there are traffic lights here there is a traffic lights here so we're up this path let's go back to the beginning right in the car park basically so maybe here that's the bend that goes out yeah um down here no that was where the traffic light was on yeah yeah let's do that oh and two yards wow that took much longer than it should have done nevermind let's see is this the last round yeah let's see what the last round gives us the rookery are we in newcastle no that's just a housing estate site okay let's move along what's that sign say butters john b right oh that's pleasant i guess it's halloween okay i know safety which way should we go to find out what stage and this is crew maybe um um the apple that was the sign i was trying to look for alexandra sweet crew alex fc crew alex huh let's go around here right to the front unipot so there's a decent-sized station is this crew you're not gonna have any signs on the front okay interesting choice um okay right um nothing at the front here oh moon flakes daily what i guess i hadn't put sponsorship up yet at this point mournflake what what is moon flake what i knew it would disappear hey with crew alexandra what let me know in the comments what morton flake is a very strange sponsor okay so crew is near elites is that right or is it darby no stoke okay so yep mournflake stadium that's so bizarre uh where did we start right down the side by the back entrance we're on this main road the compass this is going north-ish is there a split in the road up there looks like there's a pub at the end there no must be on this road oh i don't think so i think this is that apple whatever right that's at the car park which is just up there oh right sign catherine street oh are we up here yes okay i get it i get it so this was that up here wasn't it there a pub at the end of this one is that not a pub okay so we're probably about here i'd say yeah come on last round and four points good so what did we end up with bloodied over bloody kent what okay so i didn't be my previous school hopefully some of you who watched the previous game many months ago remembered where the marker was for dover and got your full points back on that and got some redemption however i didn't i got worse but it was still fun i still enjoyed it i hope you guys did too let me know what school you got in the comments um what one mucked you up the most and and did you forget to move about like i did because that would have made things a lot easier and quicker but never mind i hope you enjoyed it thank you very much for watching and i will see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

everyone welcome back to another geography along um before i start i want to say sorry for not bringing out a video on thursday a bit of good and bad news um i've found a new job which is great but um i don't seem to have time to do three videos a week so i'm gonna go down to two uh probably tuesdays and fridays i wanna keep it regular for you guys uh so continue with the train map obviously on tuesdays and something else on a friday so i hope you'll watch and play along but today i found this map scottish places not in scotland which i thought sounded interesting so i thought we'd give this one a go so let's see what scottish places we're not in so invite you guys link will be in the description below if you want to play along and uh let's start the game right where hiddell go county i don't recognize that as a scottish name but all right we're in america looks american can't see anything around here so i'll move what's that a little law stuff around here a lot of stuff around here okay let's see so dalgo courthouse county courthouse state rep terry canales district 40. uh what any of those things mean let's say texas okay so we in texas i such a confusing place okay let's let's have another look around here this is going to be a another law firm oh he's a state representative of district 40. okay right um okay so i guess have a look at texas um quite a big place sorry if you can hear that siren um hmm i don't even know where to start looking really hidalgo county is that the name of the city or is that because they have counties don't they in america so 170 on this side over here so maybe is that a road number i'll be able to find otherwise i don't really know what else to go on um there's a sign down here say lone star national bank we're definitely in texas uh no i don't can't see anything else i don't want to go wander around too far there should be plenty here to find on the map i guess so let's have a look for 107. does that make sense to look for that i don't know if it's these rows or their other these ones that shape square so that doesn't help right um wonderful i think i'll have a look around try and find a road 107 and see if that leads me to something and i'll be back okay well found 107 i found a place called well that's not edinburgh that's not how you spell it but i guess this is the connection maybe with uh scotland which would make sense right so we were on now i always get this wrong so this sign doesn't mean that that road is university road it means this one's university road right so i don't understand doesn't mean i don't know so 10th avenue that's what i'm going to look for is this is the 107 look here 10th street was it 10th avenue 10th avenue look at the compass mate this road is going south ish um hmm [Music] it's got to be this road or am i looking for university something okay so i thought i've got to go back to edinburgh i guess is what it's called um and there's university here so it's got to be around here so i zoomed in a bit found uh the county courthouse county clerk so this is where we are so let's go back to the beginning and we were outside elections administration building and the law offices ramon garcia that's here so we're right on the corner plot somewhere around here on this side of the road yeah okay let's get this see okay good all right that was fairly easy i don't know why it took me so long but it should have been a lot quicker so where are we now tim hortons so that is canada right was there tim hortons elsewhere maybe so what is scottish here is it the road graham street main street uh i don't know what that says don't know what that says let's get a better viewpoint on it not really um okay see what's over here glenn co glencoe okay so that's the scottish part glenn co so we are in canada okay there's other flags here that was on the street sign as well wasn't it s swm is that should i know what that means s-w-m let's go back over let's go down this street no it doesn't help um oh why is the footage so crappy um what else we got in town here let's see some more lawyers why is there so many lawyers freemasons as well interesting um [Music] i love the old town uh mayhew family fashions nice give me something guys pretty strong maine more law offices i guess you're another law place are you and a boutique why is there so many lawyers bank of montreal thank you very much doesn't mean we're in montreal i guess so but it gives us somewhere to start um yeah let's start around montreal where am i going over here right yes and looking for glenn cove um what is swm on that flower oh look at this scots town do you think he's gonna be around here all right well here i go again i will be looking around scott's town seems like a likely place east angus here lots of scots scottish names and i'll see if i can find it and i will be back i found it i found this sign saying middlesex county 80 and i realized that this road numbers here is glencoe we started off by the tim hortons let's have a look wow i think i'm running out of space with my memory cards near the train line just here right let's try that god wow good two yards that took absolutely far too long hopefully i've got enough room my camera is not telling me how much longer i've got left on it so that's good um maybe i will just quickly change that memory card so i'll see you in a second okay so it says one hour 56 for that so that should be fine right next one wow i'm only on round three oh oh no it's photos photos through photosphere adventure media services how do i know what is scottish jolly boys right well i'm not going to spend age trying to pinpoint this one at least so hmm um [Music] so my first thought was like south africa or something are we driving on the left we might well be driving on the left huh um okay i think i'm just gonna go all in with south africa um [Music] there must be places with scottish stones in south africa um yeah there's newcastle um what else we got let's just find a scottish name and plonk it there shall we come on there's got to be someone somewhere someone there's got to be one somewhere right um scott berg i'll pop it here a minute gotta do better than that i reckon um it's probably a smaller place i probably should be zooming in east london bedford no it's not scottish aberdeen here we go let's pop it here and let's see let's see okay completely wrong country livingston okay fair enough in zambia right cool okay interesting what where were we by a museum jolly boys backpackers okay okay well yeah i went all in and that's what happens when you go all in big old distance but not you know too far on the old line all right let me know how you figured out that i was in the wrong country and that you got the right one ah i've ever had around in i don't think so i just don't think so all right let's see what we got next swan reach it's not very scottish stewart highway uh overtaking big truck hunter something this one reach d1 that's good i mean it seems like australia to me paisley road or paisley is scottish should we go down paisley right over front axis i don't think there's much here is aetherian church over driving toilets okay not much so let's go back to the beginning i think did i see signs that way or is it this way some there look at this one d1 walkery an a20 how am i gonna find that i don't even know what state a20 d1 right look at this type if you need yeah these a's oh well there's an oh there's an a20 with the yellow there's walkery up oh okay um walkery is to the north oh paisley we're on paisley pacey road stuart height oh sturt highway where did i read that it's here wouldn't it yes okay well i was pretty lucky um right so we're on this junction probably around here go that makes up for the south african one thanks australia that was scarily painless okay let's go while it's still good fives last round we back in canada again tim horton over there one day i'm gonna go visit a tim horton see what it's like um i'd say hamilton because i remember seeing a hamilton when i was looking for coe oh stay bridge suites let's have a look without moving i think it was down here yeah there's hamilton um stay bridge sweets and a tim horton um it's probably a good idea to get some road noise it might not even be here it might just be a business excuse me um is that a hotel or right just flat walmart where's the timmy the timmy horton jim tim oh my god tim yeah wow well um let's start central then shall we there's got to be loads of tim hortons though right there's one there let's see you got a stay bridge sweets what else around us i guess let's say king street seoul city uh store hamilton store fixtures king street king street west okay there we go king street west is that one-way road right we're looking north and there's like a river okay so king street goes across it's a one-way road we can find this i'm going to spend time finding this i will probably speed this up yes paisley avenue tim hortons it's not that one is it yes king street west okay so we're looking at the back of the tim hortons oh aren't we so is this it's a public library no idea what that is strange um frozen for a minute sorry what road are we on then there's parking in this sweet comes down does carry on over um this looks fairly straight the point we're seeing it so we do carry on over so it can't be could be this one i can't didn't see a scotia bank though or are we on paisley avenue but there's no tim hortons here hmm sterling street that's another scottish place okay bond street that would make more sense with the compass wouldn't it would we see the timberwolves from there maybe probably not okay i'm gonna move i'm gonna find out what street we're on so we are on caroline colorado what now i'm really confused are we further down oh this is quite a long road i did not realize that okay and it stops looks like king street west caroline street or something king west these streets confuse me so much king street west are we on king street west is this king street west oh what's this done if it's not no what is caroline street caroline street north right caroline street this is caroline street no marion klein so highway 8 and then king street west is pierce [Music] right dundees dress coin margaret right come on concentrate um caroline street that's south right south and north right there's the tim hortons there's a stay bridge sweets this is more like it right wow wow so here was them that's why we could see the backers tim hortons yes got it here let's go yes okay what did we get 21 396 not too bad i think we're very lucky that there was a lot of the americas somehow australia was very nice to me and it was where i first looked and found that road number the only issue was me just going full pelt in south africa without any other information but it could have been a lot worse could have been a lot worse so i i'm very happy with myself let me know what you did in the comments below what could i have looked for on that zombie around maybe there's something that will point me towards zambia next time but yeah let me know um also let me know what map you'd like me to do next i'm going to try and do a bit more taxing maps i've been doing a lot of the easy ones recently so if i'm only doing two videos gotta make them interesting and maybe a little harder but still taking it easy because you know it's a game and it's all about having fun so with all that being said i will leave you to get on with euro weekend thank you very much for watching and i'll see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 26.30161091632413, "lng": -98.16420745457256}, {"round": 2, "lat": 42.74679023240668, "lng": -81.70954150398383},

"hello welcome back to another geoguessr play along and i have found this map where's that ikea i thought this would be a good fun one to do hopefully fairly easy so why not midweek gentle maps time yeah set this as a challenge should we do no moving no no let's just gentle easy going map which is more like my style all right link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's see where's that ikea right now sully does that spanish i think that's spanish yes okay good thank you all right are we in spain or another spanish-speaking country are these eu bashers maybe let's move along and see what else we can see um oh flags so that's the spanish flag i don't know what that other one is though maybe that's an area in spain okay so we're in spain now we just need to work out where in spain so there's got to be a road no don't no i'm stuck in the cover come this way right it's got to be a main road which would hopefully have directions to somewhere nice a lovely clear road sign is what i'm hoping for um i reckon it's got to be this way what's down there anyway let's see so a madrid and burgos e5 and the n1 okay where's burglars in area so e5 e5 green n1 red where'd the n5 go huh what e5 green n1 red sounds like i'm playing battleships or something um n111 there's a green e5 i presume we're on the outskirts of madrid burgos can we see burgos um e5 sticking with the e5 uh which i think ends there but that's it something completely blind okay so e5 burgos e5 also look out for ikea where'd the e5 go now ah e5 do you go down here yes you do okay e5 burgos ikea i might speed this up it takes me a little while which you know quite possible what's this commercial area commercial stuff okay i think i found it yes okay cool this is the one so i found another ikea and it wasn't the one it didn't have media marks next to it i found a sign to the m50 which is finally led me into this part um e5 wow to find the ikea ah where was the other place i was looking for then i can't even remember the name of it now i can't see it i just can't well hopefully this is the right one it's got to be i hope nah right so this is where we started um right in the middle kind of a bit more closer to media mark there's salida yeah yeah i can wait around this road here this one there's a click and click blockers over there right entrance and then this bit yeah i think we're there let's see oh good all right so who knew there's so many iqs around i don't even remember the last time i went to one um okay so uh that's that german um [Music] i don't know actually not sure it's german it's cold i mean snowy some lovely heels and some beautiful signs all right so yeah oslo what where am i going um e16 e39 to the center cell house what does that mean uh a16 e 39 is down here elsand and oslo so there's oslo and where is elsond because that will give us a hopefully a direction someone started drilling i think don't know what this hopefully you can't hear it i'm sorry right e16 uh e39 and elsand okay i can't see alessand so i don't know around this way or the other end why am i still staring at them okay salvus on the 564. let's see these ones here so maybe if we find the 564 okay guys so i found 564 e39 e16 all here and i couldn't find the ikea so then i looked for other places so we got borjus and jisc so i found jisc and huss is right next to it but i couldn't see a sign for ikea now there's the ikea charging station here which makes you think this is ikea but there's no sign oh it's got to be and this is a roundabout that we're on when we first saw the signs i'm so confused but i'm sure this is the place so i'm gonna go back to the beginning um here's some charging places um i think we're on this road here this is a weird loop thing yep i don't know why there isn't a sign for the ikea on the map but um i think this is it so let's see okay cool another two yards that's good excuse me right let's try the next one so america i guess that's a state flag virginia's let's say i think that's virginia so we've got a country and estate which is nice it's that so down here home furnishings done i thought that might say a town on it okay and let's see for another row sign let's get into virginia virginia right let's check the outline because well i'm not good with states as we all know uh right thank you for visiting ponte mac mills circle that's um a car right they've got some road names that's helpful male circle what's the name of town i'm sure ponte mac is a car brand have a quick look i mean probably won't be able to see it from this zoomed out anyway um we're up here here just keeping an eye on the uh state line there because i'm likely to go over it without realizing um i can't find those places at first glance so definitely need to look for another road sign i mean this has been good so far they're all large out of town ikeas which means there's always going to be a handy little road sign like this interstate 95 south right 95 okay um how far is this go looks like it probably goes all the way through yes all the way through let's just check oh pontomaca river maybe there is a place called pontomac right interesting um where's this arlington where's the 95 goes that's where it stops okay is it worth following the 95 until we see an ikea what happens to the 95 here hey hmm okay so we've got a home depot here target and stuff all the other names of places i've heard of um but what did we have across the road um what was this costco so look out for costco as well ponte mcmills road to mcmills road and wound wooden socket okay costco ikea ponte mac mills road okay i'm going to do this i'm going to follow the 95 [Music] what's up so that sign means oh no you got this weight to get to the 95. oh maybe we should do that maybe we should do that where god this is big i'm still all right so big ah what's over here bye bye all right um when do we get to the 95 floor and decor up back so we on the 95 i don't get it we must be on the 95 right okay ponte mac mills come to macmillan's mall and these are all the things that are here ponte mac mills and this is the river called the pontomac right and this is the border so you've got ponte mac yard okay i'm probably going to speed this up because i've been wearing about the i-95 ponte mac strange businesses i'm gonna have a look shut up and have a look around the map and find something ponte mac i guess here and i found ikea so where did we start right at the entrance does it have the entrance on here yes it does cute so i reckon on that corner corner here all right let's get another good okay excuse me 12 yards excuse me okay that's all right good let's go hey hey dollars uh what kind of dollars um there's a hilton garden in that's quite a good thing to use to pinpoint are you in america again yep okay so another state flag and i don't know state flags i always just hope they've got the statement well we can go this way okay cool this one does not awesome awesome okay excuse me guys so i want to see what that shot was but i couldn't see and then i missed this sign here ah exit an additional pocket that was helpful what is helpful i need to know which way to get out oh go back what'd that say germantown germantown parkway interstate 40. i think it would be helpful to know what state first though wouldn't it um germantown i think could be over this way wouldn't you hmm well there's a 40 okay so and start from the beginning again shall we do that again that worked right last time okay so germantown parkway is just the name of the road good one me so what else we got going on ikea way okay lovely um anybody gonna tell me what state or city we're in country wood crossing country wood crossing this country vitamin shop full house i think i'm gonna cough again excuse me right is there a big sign up there shops at rock creek maybe what creek is what to look for hmm all right i'm gonna have a look yeah i'm gonna have a look along the 40 and see if i can find something and i'll be back with hopefully another ikea i think i found it yes crete parkway here we go so i went a bit further down the road and found a sign to memphis and uh were in nashville oh my brain yes nashville and then i went a bit further and sound these two signs western east interstate 40. so i found country woods then i found the ikea so where did we start at the exit ikea is to the north so on the road yeah charging stations are down there yes not confident about pinpointing this one but i think we're there yeah let's try it okay i thought i might lose a point for that one oh right oh sorry last one i've been really taking a long time on these but you know it's working out full scores so is it a good thing i hope so for this not sure what language that is some beautiful uh wind turbines there majestic beasts all right so we've got a decathlon and whatever that is sterpnitch into sport decathlon mcdonald's and of course ikea looks like there's a lovely sign over here so loot so i'm guessing oh belgium and he said france thank you very much arlon um near the front border artists all um and i think it must be the name of the park shopping area i don't think it's the name of the place no there are some double-barreled name places here though what do you reckon should we uh stop me from staring at the map again and go and get some road numbers or a town name for sure a town i'm sorry i keep hitting the mic i thought i'd put it in a different position so i can see the screen easier and stuff and i hope it works if not all this video is done for nothing right moving okay let's get more information me get out the way truck is that luxembourg where'd that thing go okay let's go over here sterpnitch e25 e411 oh i do have any numbers here i could have said sound ball like scandinavia but um it's not so i'll shut up e25 or the e4 11 it's 420 i'm not sure how the numbering works here 25 and 4 11. all right i will speed this up think i found it i think i found it okay so we go at the beginning ikea is over there to the east with something else maison's gallery into sport which is here right yes maisons okay and then that's to the east and then to the west we have decathlon yes okay we are on this road here now let's get this right so we've got the roundabout behind us it takes you to enter sport which roundabout that is that second round about there i think so yes so we must be on this road here um and then do we see this weird loop going to another roundabout what a strange setup okay so we are here i reckon maybe there let's see last round all in four points maybe i should go to ikea now maybe it's a sign i don't even know where my nearest one is i think i'd need a car anyway let's just check full points wonderful good mix i was a bit upset we didn't get an asian one though because that would have been a bit more a bit harder to pinpoint a bit more interesting but i still enjoyed this map maybe i'll do it again yeah maybe i'll do it again see if we can get some harder ones i mean they were annoying to pinpoint but they weren't hard were they but let me know how you did um maybe no moving is the best one to do to really muck us up and try our hardest on that but um i'm not sure i'm up for that right now let me know how you did in the comments and i will see you next

"hello welcome back to another geography along and today i thought we'd do another satellite alternative map so another drone type thing i guess um this one is large cities from above so hopefully it will be fairly recognizable places um nice gentle saturday map it's saturday morning as i'm recording this so hopefully i'll get this out in time but we'll still take it nice and easy it's not so sunny today so it's nice to just chill out play a little geo guesser so come along and play set it as a challenge no default we are using default settings no harsh no moving or anything like that today the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's see what we get all right t-mobile arena that's helpful hopefully aria don't know what that is at the cosmopolitan park mgm so i'm starting to think we're in vegas excalibur yes we are definitely in vegas what is that let alone this thing and what a strange place what a very strange place i thought there was more big weird buildings but is it just this area just this little bit weird what a very strange place okay so this should be fairly easy to pinpoint we're above the arena [Music] right mgm ground is here so that's the excalibur where's the um t-mobile arena there it is so we are probably on this junction let's have a look down so right on the corner here aren't we i don't know how exact this will be but let's try and be exact shall we so this is the arena that must be that road that uh this must be this road coming off here so i think we're probably in around here somewhere yeah let's try right okay 25 yards out that's not bad for pinpointing so that's good to know but i don't know if it's the person that takes a photo that sets where it was not sure but good start right next one is driving on the left lane one form like avengers assemble okay what not sure this is big or what so we've got a flag here that i'm not really sure what it is i was wondering if that's a kiwi bird there um [Music] mini cap germany e um what else can we spy bright computing maybe consulting bright something i don't know what that says maybe a shopping center we're definitely driving on the left once we got down here don't know i'm gonna giant roundabout it looks like it giant flag pole roundabout there must be something else i'm missing that will help me um obviously the flag if i knew what it was but am i thinking [Music] new zealand or hmm to us we got was that ernst young amp nab whatever nab is aeon is that like kind of financial district or something going on here and then there's this you hear my cat there i kind of recognize that from another game i feel like that's like a parliamentary building or something i'm sure that was in canberra so i'm really confused now don't know what that's trying to say okay um let's try in new zealand first i was just trying to think what the road markings look like in new zealand but i don't really don't have an idea so yeah i'm gonna try new zealand first and wellington i guess um because obviously there's some bridges and stuff but i think we are by the sea actually are we cat thinks it's lunchtime by the way so that's why he's being a bit noisy yeah i don't think if we are in new zealand that it is wellington i might speed this up but i'm gonna have a look around wellington and see if i can convince myself if it's here if not i'll have a look at some other cities around new zealand and then move on to australia i'm not really getting australian vibes so i guess maybe one of the islands who took the picture daniel jacob okay that doesn't really help i will probably see you in a bit oh my god i don't know why i didn't look at canberra straight off why did i look at camera straight off it's canberra isn't it right and we're on this way on this round about here along the straight road to what i said was why did i spend all that time when i knew exactly where it was ridiculous ridiculous okay i think we're definitely here that's that car park we can see here oh i'm just disappointed with myself but during that time i heard some motorbike alarms going off and some people shouting down the street which is quite fun for a saturday morning um maybe i'll put a few sound bites of that in if you like uh right so we've got to be here i knew it from the beginning stupid me but good that's the perfect score okay let's try the next one oh it's daddy l okay what build existed what wow where are we wow jesus okay um what a strange shape building and it's not one i recognize so excuse me sir can you sit over here please thank you sorry about that um that looked like snow so ah please don't be in russia we all know how rubbish i am with russia i'm not really getting any sense of where what is this place i mean it doesn't even seem to be any other tall buildings just this weird spire thing um right willie mason took the picture manson sorry sorry willie unless we could be in canada maybe um or anchorage but i don't see why they would have such a ridiculous building there i can't even see in the cars so you can't tell what side of the road we're on or anything like that i mean this area looks kind of industrial or it's just so covered in snow that you can't really see any details i'm sure some of you recognize this building straight off lovely for you i'm glad for you right so i might um i don't really see any mountains or anything it's an amazing picture but don't really help me does it okay i might start in canada i don't think it's something you'd see in edmonton um let's have a quick look at anchorage i lived up i'm just gonna have a look along this kind of line across the world and see if i can spot crazy building i don't even know what it's called and is it just a tower it doesn't even look like it's a building you know what's what's going on inside there what are you for why are you okay i'm gonna have a scare around see what i can find i'll definitely speed it up because it's gonna take me a while um yeah i'll see you in a bit okay i just don't know i just don't know what i'm looking for don't know what the building is called can't get a feel for where i think it is i think i might just stick with north america just my first thought but i don't know where i just don't think it's anchorage i mean what am i looking for in the map weird tower building um yeah i don't know so i'm going to plonk it i am going to plonk it and i'm going to plunk it i don't know what i hope i'm kitten red deer and let's see if i was at least fairly close to it or zero points what do you reckon i reckon zero points let's see yeah bloody russia there's some petersburg oh my god lacta center what what is it ah i just didn't think it was that big a place i guess it's just so covered in snow oh bugger all right i'm gonna move on from that have you guys seen that building before was that easy for you i'll never forget that man all right come on at least we can see now no clouds beautiful coastal area um right so some big old cruise ships over here a fair amount of cruise ships over there wow so i think it's got to be like oh maybe antigua i don't know how big the buildings get over there another a on so that seems to be the theme of the game that bank of america bank of canada hmm not sure that would probably help if i could read that can't see driving on the right i think so i think we are driving on the right um do we have yellow robe markings possibly is that a flag maybe all right i mean i don't know what florida looks like does florida have this kind of stuff going on [Music] what are the cities in florida orlando tampa miami i think it looks like miami um oh does it huh so i thought they had a big beach from but maybe they don't hmm what is that that was here a minute um round basing yep okay i think we're in miami wow okay that was fairly easy so we're just above what that um opposite that ish kind of okay i think we're probably about maybe here let's see come on one point oh further okay yeah i don't know if i agree with that i don't know if i agree with that do you yeah i'm not sure i agree with that but got it did not go to completely right last round let's see can we bring it back from the brink of bad points oh cop load load please thank you thank you right um in the big city some lovely mountains who took the picture delias 1967. so we're hiking she's hiding the doggies looking pretty disappointed let's see what kind of houses we got here yeah first thoughts was like peru or something maybe but i'm not really sure i am not great with south america um maybe i need to play some south american maps to really get an idea um [Music] you guys are probably tourists hmm really not sure um i don't think i just don't think that's the end of that sentence um i don't think it's north america but i am definitely not sure uh very big place not the coast is it okay so i guess i'm gonna start my first thought was peru so let's start in peru um i don't think we're on the coast sure it's lemur because i think that's all land round here i think it's a landlocked place um or could it be equitable it's so mountainous everywhere around here and quite large hmm don't know how i'm going to pinpoint this i don't know if i have the stamina for that today oh that's annoying always last round always that looks so cool miss maybe that there is a lake out there because it's fairly misty um so go back to peru a minute oh where have i gone yep you know maybe what do you think i'm surrounded by mountains um hmm i think i'm going to stick with peru because that was my first thought just because of the these mountains and i'm probably completely wrong it's probably going to be another embarrassing loss of points um but yeah i think choose a long thin country you can't really bang it in the middle and hope for the best we la paz obviously has the same lake i'd like to think we'd see an airport but this is quite a lot going on down here isn't there um now i'm liking the paths yeah i'm gonna go i'm gonna go le paz i'm gonna go up here am i yeah here see bloody us really salt lake city salt lake city looks like that wow who would have thought it well hopefully one of you did and got some points on that 10 points wow right what was the final score okay 15 026 these big long lines here well well it is it is the thing it is what it is i can't believe i didn't go to canberra straight away for that one but i'm glad i did it did get it and not hit myself later for not even trying to go to canberra but these two terrible i have no sense no sense of areas oh well oh well let me know how you did um [Music] i'm sure you did better than me please tell me you did better than me because that's the only thing that gets me through when i do badly but let me know your scores in the comments what did i miss on those two rounds where i just went well i should have known it was russia i just did not think it would be some petersburg but now i know there's a weird tower building there and that last round did not think that was the u.s but i was wrong so let me know why i was wrong how i do so badly and thank you very much for watching and i will see you in the next one for hopefully a better school bye you ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 36.101126, "lng": -115.1796133}, {"round": 2, "lat": -35.2823715, "lng": 149.1286011}, {"round": 3,

"hello welcome back to another geographer play along and today i thought we would do a classic and do geo detective um i can't remember the last time i played this map i've got close to a perfect score but it took me over an hour can't promise i won't happen again today but let's see if we can get a perfect score or at least over 24 000 in less than an hour that would be nice but i don't know we'll see we'll see take it nice and gently as usual and see what happens so let's set this as a challenge the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's give it a go right so it looks very american to me okay bronx zoo so bronx is in new york right is it i have no idea um okay should be findable should be pinpointable if it is new york why are you thinking of brooklyn um probably i don't know much about america the bronx here i'm just making that up and now here it is east bronx bronxu okay that wasn't so bad was it so i presume we're on this side so the zoo is on the east so that would be correct this would be the entrance here so some we've got a row going down there i haven't said it as no moving but i will try and not to move if i can this one luckily is quite good i'll probably end up moving on the next round i bet so i think we're in between these two buildings here let's see good good start puts me in a good mood this however we're in america again california i might say california on it um oh oh what does that say don't know okay well maybe i will have to move on this one self-fulfilling prophecy maybe there's some kind of bay and then california it's obviously on the coast so i don't know that will help so that's over to the south south west a bit of hills here what's up california something i'm feeling really uncomfortable today moving about a lot right oh that's a little bay here and then [Music] we've got more water over here that looks more ocean to the north ish have a look at california so we got eureka up here that has you could have that kind of place in between do we think it's here recreation area now it's like a camp isn't it like a one of those places people of america go for summer camp or whatnot um [Music] dunes and wetlands new navy base is a navy base around here some other bits around here yeah cabins and resort friends of the dunes so sounds a bit crazy okay um there's no like camp marked on here sorry you can hear that bike there's been a lot of bikes today having a lovely day riding about south to the north i like it but it's not quite right is it hmm a little bit more up here mad river oh that's uh this is a beach that sounds a bit nuts right i'm going to i'm going to start at the top of california i'm gonna go all the way down and see if i can find like a holiday camp so it was to the south west it's north east i'm gonna see what i can find maybe it's a lake either side i'm gonna have a scout around and i will see you in a bit i have found quite a few cameras but i thought why why i'm moving just move be the easiest thing to do hopefully i'll find something but this car is going in a strange direction okay um where are we going [Music] right that was it's unhelpful some kind of little bay there i think that goes out hmm a lot of lakes could be around a lake oh this is frustrating isn't it i don't think we're near san francisco maybe we're further down here somewhere like this historic lighthouse didn't see that see an historic lighthouse nope okay i'm gonna carry on looking because this is not fun i will speed it up but yeah i'm very confused very confused we'll find it i'll find you somewhere i'll be back okay i found this oh no i didn't even consider that it could be an island a place called two harbours which has this kind of thing going on over here to the north east so it looks like there's a pier there that could be a harbour so [Music] i'm going to go for here yeah i think i can't see what's on this sign can we i think i might try this place here let's try it let's see let's see how oh oh no i lost a point oh if i just tried to pinpoint that bit better i really wasn't sure oh my god okay but it's only one point missed what did i get on the last time i played this oh i can't believe i got that okay more faith more faith in myself okay cool next we can do it we can do it well not america again i don't think it can't be china what do you say filipino parish binando vanilla okay where am i going manila what did i say binondo the most holy rosary filipino parish yeah binondo manila is not really a place that's come up much so there's tondo bin binodo binodu um let's see if we can find that if not i'll spin round and see what else there is to be seen um it's quite a big place i'm gonna need some water for this one i think hold on okay right i might speed this up i'm going to look for bin non binondo i don't know why i can't say that binondo i'm going to look around manila for that i don't know how far out to look and then if i can't find that i'll look for some other clues yes okay i found a church called minor basilica and national shrine of no matter how much i zoom in it doesn't give me the rest um and this is called minor basilica national shrine of san lorenzo ruins um is this the same one church cool so what else can we orient ourselves with hsbc down here is there an hsbc here not that i can see there's so much going on here um lorenzo ruiz i reckon this is the right place i reckon this is the right place so very annoying that the hb at hsbc isn't here to orient ourselves worrying orientate brain's broken you know what i mean right so let's use the compass so this road is going north east so much going on there um then we're going to a very big road which is to the south west the church is on our north west i can't believe after all this time i still get used to compton what is happening to me today right so the church is to the north west so we over this side no that doesn't seem right we even at the right place oh this is embarrassing isn't it i forgot to be here got to be here all lines up um can i see a road name quintin here quentin so is that this road what is happening with these roads it's chaos absolute chaos so i reckon we've got to be around here ramada is that over here yes yes yes cool okay we must be around here and then the hsbc should be in the ramada i guess not sure um that is that little road and then we're on this little triangle bit here so yeah i think we're about here all right let's give it a try please please perfect okay okay okay oh good oh i'm happy that about that for my first vanilla one not made not bad look at this it's just too much information far too much information but yeah very happy with that how did you guys do on that one have you had manila come up before i swear that's the first time i've seen manila come up let me know let's see what the next one brings i'm not in america again are we um naval air station army depot padre island drive via ocean drive i feel like i've had this round before um [Music] i remember this corpus something what was it i definitely remember it's like a newspaper building or something if i remember so this is the um it pauses puerto rico i get them mixed up i know that's bad okay let's have a look yeah puerto rico um i presume san juan because i don't know anywhere else in puerto rico so we've got some road names here so naval air station padre island drive via ocean drive and this massive corpus whatever building so where's the air base that's the airport excuse me do you have the air base labelled on it okay let's look in a bit further um so you'd think ocean drive would be around the coast somewhere wouldn't you padre island drive is there a place called pedro island are you called just 165 okay i'm gonna have a look around here see what i can see and i'll be back okay i don't think we're in portfolio i think that's just put me off this is too much english around right so i'm gonna move i'm gonna move up here see just an exit sign all right let's move down here see what we can see so what is this corpus christi cooler times see knew it was a newspaper so i've definitely had this round before and i can't remember where it is oh that's so annoying we got here twix street and mesquite street so what's that what is that was that stadium or is it fairy terminal hmm it's got to be something nearby that will give us what we need what a burger field what what is this place this is not real this can't be real twig street what is it south texas of course it is okay is there a place called corpus christian strange name right to do texas south yes there is a place called corpus christi okay now if i'd known that this would have been a lot quicker i'm sorry guys so there's the amphitheater where's the burger field or something i'm sorry if you're from texas it's all very strange to me right so we are looking for corpus christi times i had road names what am i doing i'm so sorry these strange places really make me go a bit crazy right so this is chaparral street that's going east ish chaparral street this way metro ministries huh uh twig street was the other one wasn't it i'm going to speed this up because i'm just mucking about here not really looking very well i'll be back when i finally found oh here's chaparral street so where's there's american bank which we can see from where we started so where's the corpus christi times sorry corpus christi stephen center this place is really dummy and i'm so sorry okay i've got there this place has really done a number on me so i think we're actually on twig street i can never remember how it works in american roads because i presume the road name that you can see in front of you is the one you're going towards but i think that's wrong i don't understand the roads so we are here somewhere we are under this road so i think we're probably about here somewhere maybe here a bit further up yeah i think we're probably there right oh don't okay good thank you and this right this big it's it's just too much what's this what's that what is that how does that even work as a road i don't understand all right i've got to move on from this is really fried my brain that round okay where are we now no there's nothing to see oh really testing now so euro plates on there so c is out to the southeast these so no some kind of dox maybe because there is euro marks on that i was thinking grease first off but not really sure about that let's see what these things are i think it is a dox hmm another long row to try and pinpoint ourselves on um what is it's gone okay let's carry on let's see what we can see and i can't remember how many times i've moved now but i think it was enough to warrant never trying this no move maybe i should have been a good test of miss skills well i've seen that wasn't it right in greek so oh because my second thought was maybe corsica not corsica oh gosh what's the name cyprus can't be cyprus gonna let's go the other way let's follow that car they look like uh attacks in star wars is it i can't remember it looks like them anyway you know what i mean some road signs nice cooler and cagliari so must be italy right right it's a big old road there they are again what are ya [Music] not good with italian language so maybe it is corsica wait cause french i get this right that one's the french one that one's the italian one right hmm gonna have a look around some of these italian islands oh okay here's cagliari so we just came from that way all right that's where we came from isn't it cagliari that way pooler that way what's this way fintrato anas so this is going north east what was the other place so where's paul is that maybe we're in between okay guys i'm not having much good luck with this one another sign that said going down here is to georgino um [Music] and this is where the zone central industrial zone is so i can only imagine we are down here somewhere um i just don't know what else to go by so let me know in the comments what you spotted that got you on to the right path because i'm just i don't know i don't know what else to go with so i don't know if we're this close to industrial stuff so see it in the distance more than anything so i might go on here now here yeah i'm going for it let's see how badly wrong i am oh i got a got a new badge right i did look up here i just couldn't find anything that looked right i thought this is the city we can see in the distance got to go with my instincts never mind never mind how did you guys do on that one that one had me everyone really did let's see what the final score was so over 24 000 which is great i hopefully i've done it in less than an hour 50 minutes that's okay i'll take that one oh well so close but i feel like i am getting better a lot of american rounds that texas one really got to me i'm sorry that was a terrible oh never mind well let me know how you did in the comments below what did i miss on that italian one i should have put it where i thought i should i should have just gone with it every time i say that i will be more i can't even think of a word trust full of myself yes anyway thank you so much for watching guys and i will see you next time ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 40.85176893387593, "lng":

"hello everyone welcome back to another geography play along before i start i just want to say it's been six months since i've started doing this channel really enjoying it um i want to say thank you to the guys who've been with me all that time the last few months or so it's been a pleasure playing these games with you guys um and because i've managed to keep this channel up i got myself a new computer yay so there should be no more i'm sorry my computer's slowing down i have to wait for the map to load fingers cross i've done it all properly and it all works well um which means i can do satellite maps now without issues so that should be good fun um the other thing i wanted to say and this is a youtube break if you haven't subscribed please consider subscribing because it does really help and it would be great to get to 100 subscribers because then i can do community posts which means i can put up polls to see what games you guys want to play so that would be a really nice thing to be able to do to really engage with you guys um but thank you so much for watching i really do appreciate it and i hope we can have another fun six months of nice casual geography so with all of that out the way and said and i thought test the computer do a satellite map why not do the 198 capitals of the world which is the first map i put up on my channel which was not so great hopefully i've got better since then but we shall find out in this if you don't have the script um installed to play satellite maps you can still play along with this game it will just show you the street view version of it so you can still play along if you want to so let's get into this game and see how good we are right set this as a challenge the uh sorry the link will be in the description below if you would like to play along and uh let's see how we're doing all right ah that's better isn't it lovely great new computer right okay so a little island i don't really recognize a shape so what information can we get here um driving on the right look how nicely that zooms in and out without any issues it's not whirring around amazing okay uh um i'm not sure am i thinking oceania or south america i think maybe south america [Music] or yeah i'm gonna have a look in south america first yes let's try wee over here um right it's not popular um no no nope next allison johns i think so this is a little easier on the uh islands is satellite map isn't it but i think we must be over the other side um that was my downfall in the first every game i posted up i'll never forget that right let's move on over here so i don't think it's vanuatu to lose just sambar isn't it yeah okay it was vanuatu but the capital city is on a different island so this must be it right is there an airport that we can see here yes definitely it okay right sorry that took me a little bit so this is that bit so we're on this part here [Music] let's move that over there and so down this main road this up breaks off here we must be at this supermarket here yes let's do it oh lovely good let's get a perfect score on this game shall we next one not an island by the exhibit this is some very strange soil um sandy i guess excuse me i've got frog in my throat today okay is that an airport is it are the cars where are you driving to what huh very strange okay uh what else could we cut here it's quite large but it's on the coast which really helps pinpoint um let's find a road here excuse me can't really tell are we driving on the right i think we're driving on the right i think so um okay so coastal city deserty um driving on the right it's a cool roundabout so [Music] so i think in dakar but it doesn't look like the dakar coast so it sticks out like so so could be somewhere else on this coast mauritania maybe yes i think we are that little sticky-outy bit there looks like that sticky-outy bit okay so now we need to pinpoint ourselves so sticky outy bit wolf do you think that's this wolf probably so we go in from there is that that roundabout it's a big old roundabout i think let's see go back wolf is up there that is the wolf let's just have a look if there's anything else that might be the wolf [Music] yes i think that's the wolf and that is just something else yep don't know what that is okay that's the wolf so going up to meet this road there's another roundabout there to that road there and then we're just up from that so that's that roundabout there so we are one two three rows down three down here oh there's so many cars there okay we can pinpoint this come on perfect score keep the perfect square in mind just smash up everything that's that little thing going on um and this is a bigger block and one two probably wait a minute that road this route or this road ah i think we're probably here let's give it a go oh no come on really okay well i didn't see that never mind at least we're in the right place i think the satellite map is maybe a bit easier than the street view version right where are we next there's a nice big river to go off on this one what do we have here what is that huh like some kind of water uh treatment thing maybe and what else we got going on not many cars there's some big roads here let's see what side of the road we're on i think the right again i can't really tell i'll find a better junction hey i know uh let's zoom back out let's see what else is there to see it's quite big oh there's an airport which is cool i don't know what that is shopping center or something maybe okay here's a better junction so i think tracking on the left yeah i think we're driving on the left okay okay any thoughts no no thoughts um i'm really not sure [Music] hmm airport big old river weird water treatment something or another i don't see any big stadiums or anything like that there's some pictures there maybe or is that just a garden that's a garden hmm what's this kind of park a big old tower in it okay how are we driving on the left i can't really tell okay oh here's a stadium doesn't look well kept so does it okay so the old river is going to be the thing where do i start looking um i think around here i don't know what side of the road most of these people these people that's terrible these countries drive on so i'll probably speed this up but i'm gonna have a take a look around and see if i can see this river looks a bit like the thames kind of not the thames but um kind of the same shape i guess but um yeah i'll be back with the right city yes okay i found it and it's not one that comes up very often vientiane in uh laos that's right yeah look at that border this river is the border between there and thailand well there you go cool so i think we're up this point here somewhere just put this there a minute that must be that water thing there's a restaurant in there what that's a restaurant interesting how did you get there i'll slip that up later that's interesting okay anyway we could have pinpoint ourselves now right so on this corner i've got a main row going up eels now let's see if we can find pinpoint ourselves properly so this is that park here and we carry on up this road so just before another big junction this junction yes good so i think we are here me and distances are not great where's this loopy bit using all the technical terms maybe a bit maybe a bit further down so that's that building right this one here this must be the hotel and maybe here let's see oh good okay still not on a perfect score though which is a shame hopefully you guys are though let me know if you're playing satellite or normal view so i think that makes a big difference is obviously a lot easier knowing well i suppose you're going to get them up here on the coast i think it's still easier on the satellite map oh i've just got really good let's go with that all right so back on the coast again which is nice and helpful zoom zoom nice big stadium some running tracks maybe looks like some um my words today that's not so really it was i can't remember the name of it asian writing wow so what happens when you stay up all night playing with your new computer making sure it works right some cool road system is going on here though oh what's that what is that very strange okay so on the coast some strange buildings going on lots of rivers there's the airport yes a big old plane there um i was thinking dubai or something but i don't remember that being that many rivers around there um but let's see let's see what we can see on the coast i think we'll be able to see the palm wouldn't we so i don't think it is there but there is a big old river system going on not being blind or it's just darkened out and i don't think it looks the same does it so what am i convincing myself otherwise no no no moving on this is a capital anyway no it's not there carry on excuse me move on right lebanon no no um hmm i think that's right no hmm interesting oh morocco yes my old friend the place i never recognized okay good so what's this here do you know some kind of maybe um let me see that one here so i feel like that is zoom back out so that's the river here's the river so a bit where's the stadium stadiums are good for pinpointing is that it was that it hmm being a bit slow on this one i think yeah that's gonna be that one around there i'm gonna touch the screen i shouldn't dirty fingers so we follow this down to that weird junction that goes around here get in there so some kind of tennis club there so that's that bit there it must be down this road that's that weird bit here so i think we're around there okay ah getting there guys get in there are we at the mosque i think we are at the mosque that's the bit that comes off the roundabout there yes come on let's do this okay i'm so sorry that took me asia i don't know some kind of block was morocco okay last round ah those two points really knock me up okay okay so on the coast again loving it some very organized roads and what do we got at the point that we are some minarets i guess that's cool um some football it's always good and we are driving on um i don't know i find the junction is always helpful so driving on the right and what else can we spy i was hoping we get like a you know paris or something so i could see what the eiffel tower looks like on the satellite map maybe i should find a satellite map that has famous places because that would be cool um some more big stadiums so so i'm thinking middle east now are we i don't know because we can see another landmass over here right yeah i don't think we're in bahrain um beauty because i think that's no i don't think so that looks a bit too close what does it um maybe you've got a circular one over there no it doesn't no it doesn't quite line up does it not quite close but no cigar right where else okay i might speed this up again and have a look i think it's back who is it no i'll probably speed this up and have a look for this place see my first idea is probably wrong we shall find out in a moment i found it it's kuwait lovely right so i was right i just didn't look didn't look hard enough so we are right on this tip here aren't we oh paintball and kuwait towers that's one that's never come up for me that's cool and we are probably here is that the road here there are mcdonald's there did not expect that okay let's just double check we are there right it's tj fridays wow um yeah i think we're there here maybe over here oh god i've probably put myself far out now okay wow okay so did not get the perfect score lost my two points what was it maritania wasn't it never mind hopefully you guys got a perfect score so i think this is my better than my first ever map i can't remember what score i got on that though yeah i can't remember what score i got on that but have i got better or is it just that the satellite maps makes it a little easier probably that probably that one but let me know how you did whether you did the satellite version or the normal version let me know your score uh thank you very much for watching please subscribe i don't think i'm gonna say thank you and i will see you next

"hello welcome back to another geography along um today i want to do something really gentle and friendly and fun to play uh so i enjoyed um just around the corner famous places just around the corner so i thought we'd give one block away a try um i'm not going to set it as no moving because i want it to be a nice gentle game but i will try and not move where i can um we'll see here we go but let's just have a nice chilled out game today so let's invite you guys link will be in the description box below if you want to play along and let's try this out all right sydney harbour okay might not even have to move at all campbells were cannibals stores so sydney um i think the bay is here isn't it okay it's quite a lot of sydney harbour here isn't there so probably around here campbell's cove here we go um campbell's store campbell store here right um does that say sculpture or something passenger terminal over there yeah so it's got to be up here right or not um it's over this side passenger terminal over here do you think no that doesn't seem right does it so we've got a stool here some kind of strange building up there it might actually be here oh i want to get this bottom so i'm going to turn around let's see that must be the bridge over there then i guess so let's bend up and round to the south so we might well be down here yeah all right let's do it um it was the wrong road done maybe i should have spent a bit longer but still four points nice right um first thoughts i don't know thai restaurant very hilly road um no i mean i'm kind of getting scandinavian vibes but let's turn around and have a look it doesn't help [Music] interesting so do we go up or down smiley people um there's no eu badges here is that no look at this window here yeah iceland okay so i first thought was right i don't know what's famous in iceland that's terrible isn't it right i'm going to stop there and see if i could find where we are um find iceland first presume we're in reykjavik um i mean it might not be but what's famous in let's put this here a minute francas fra frat cast let's have a look uh pretty much going north east so fracastica let's see if i can find that i might speed it up if it takes me a little while for [Music] cast might not even be here at all oh here we go we are so was here right if we go back the room restaurant is that on here studio lots of studios um let's go back to the beginning so we've got the thai restaurant and gulp kistan and a hair shop picturing these names here we go this is where we are let's put this here so what's the famous thing is it's just red cubic itself sure okay let's guess that good 10 yards lovely so what landmark or what have you are you around the corner from is it this i don't know what that is terrible i guess i should know was it this sculpture who knows let me know in the comments if you know what it is i should have been looking for i have no idea now i do all right let's uh move on to the next one okay there's it vegas big tall building um let's turn around the old straight road um [Music] i'm not sure not sure not sure it is america but hmm let's pop down the road says sign my computer is struggling today i'm not sure why it's probably because it knows it's being replaced soon which is exciting i'm hoping i'll be able to not have this problem anymore we shall see come on okay big old lots of nothing the arrows are pointing the other way no so that was a kosovo flag see if i got that right because you know we know we're not that good at flags all right i'm going to pop up here i might speed this up because my computer is going to take a while loading all this up and i'm just going to zoom down the road and see what's at the other end we'll see in a bit so i went down the other end of the road and there's nothing to be seen i did see a truck with some arabic writing on it though so that's something um i guess try and head to the city but i'm so confused it's like a tour bus over here i just can't think it's official coverage so we can trust the compass um but i don't know what help that gives us but down here which ways can we go not that way big old power plant or something i guess we can go this way so what's down here a sign can't really read that let's carry on isn't this fun uh that way oh only that far okay okay then where are we oh that was a big road with some signs the road in use let's exit to that city i presume can we get up here will there be anything in english okay alcahill road okay keep that in mind an airport um some other streets there's some road numbers so i suppose we could use that let's have a look i can't remember what areas have official coverage i'm going to start in saudi arabia um maybe not here look at the road numbers i'm not sure it is okay she's got some blue but i don't know it's the same e might be let's see an e45 maybe a bit closer e44 d67 okay okay 44 comes out here there's the airport that it must be pointing towards so there's a d67 another 68 here's a 67 where we dropped light in here or something very strange so i came from this way right so what did this sign say did we come from that way oh wow look at that road well that's a big old road turn off from the 44 and the 67 [Music] hmm so we come off here i'm at street i'm going to have a look around for these road names and numbers hopefully pinpoint where we started we shall see i'll be back okay so i think we're on the d67 and here's a massive substation national power construction lots of stuff like that going on um how far down were we so that's i think this junction here i think because we went up there and then went round the bend right yeah i don't know i think we might be here maybe a bit further up here all right let's give it away oh i lost a point on that those long straight rows really so again what is the is it just the city i don't get it i don't get what is the thing around the corner is it me dan don't get it all right let's try the next one but i lost a point no so pay ant paying hmm so i think the european um that looked like two blue bits so we may be in italy um so i think queen where are we in paris or france i should say um let that work sneak down there can't see anything that way look at here yes i think we might be in paris let's have a look um seven because of these you see here seventh a-r-r and i don't know what the a-a-r-r stands for but i know you get that in paris so seventh is here so we are on charles floyd quite i'm sorry about my pronunciation um [Music] look which direction we're going in and north west so release maybe so bad at finding these roads um near this thing right that's got to be the famous thing around the corner charles something right uh am i just being completely blind today a bit further out find another road name might help okay yes find another road name because there is plenty around here so what we got have a new charles floquette and rouge general lambert very british way to say that okay uh [Music] look at these little ones is this one no no i might well speed this up if it takes me a little while but i'm gonna find it i'm gonna find this little road what's this here lies the eiffel tower it's probably more likely to be around it um okay charles lockett here we go and junction with general it's not that one of the lamb but clean but um here we go so we started up this way right so north west it's behind us so we're probably here so we just have a look if we pop up here will we see is it eiffel tower yes right so must be around here come on huh ah never mind i still got four points so cool next last next and last um [Music] it kind of reminds me of holland but it's not holland so what we got here paint again so we're in france again um we're in france again what we got here brussels hmm are we in that park that is all four or five corners of each country let's have a look some black friday deals going on parking trade mart brussels brussels expo that atomium now it's saying much to me at the moment so we're probably in brussels some [Music] expo center all right let's uh look at brussels that may be the eu building if i was a big old expo building where would i be probably on the outskirts but i'm not sure atomium okay that was handy um there's a park are we on this park towering an iconic still atom sculpture oh that sounds cool i want to go see it where is it right so it's probably um which direction up here in this thing here there it is okay cool let's have a look i didn't know about this so that was fun it's massive get it cool wow [Music] i assume you can go in there can you oh look at all those maybe not that's cool all right where did we start so we went to it on the south west so yeah probably around here then um [Music] let's go back to the beginning so we went down there to see the sculpture this road is going south east so i think we went down that road um me and working things out i'm sorry south east yeah i mean so sculptures to the southwest so maybe we're down here i didn't see a roundabout no sculpture is to the southwest ah i think we were here somewhere i'm gonna leave it here and see i'm obviously not my brain's not engaged oh we were further down i didn't think we went that far just trust myself trust myself well another point lost hopefully that means you guys got a perfect score can laugh at me for not trying very hard look at the submarine eight that's a shame but a nice gentle game i quite enjoyed it i'm a bit annoyed i didn't get a full full perfect score on that but never mind i still enjoyed it it was good let me know how you did in the comments below let me know what those places were that i think was an iceland and uh uae wasn't it what was i supposed to see i don't understand but i've got a new place to visit in brussels so i might add that to my bucket list i look cool let me know uh thank you very much for watching and i will see you next time ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -33.8574554253646, "lng": 151.2092054472295}, {"round": 2, "lat": 64.1446273563819, "lng": -21.92526331143687}, {"round": 3, "lat":

"hello welcome back to another geography along sorry this one is going to be late i've had quite a weekend and not not being able to film this one in time and i'm sorry so happy sunday i guess for this one um i hope you guys had a nice weekend though and relaxed enjoyed the sunshine but now we are going to try and play flags again i haven't done it for a while um i want to see if i've actually retained any information which i highly doubt but um only one way to find out isn't there so let's play this game i said it's a challenge i'm not gonna put any limits on it gonna be a nice gentle sunny sunday game hopefully it will go well uh the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and let's start this game let's see how well we do all right i forgot to say this is a just country flags there's counties and regions as well so yeah it's probably silly um okay some more flags over there so i don't really recognize that one can you see this one is this a russian flag so look down here i'll go past them whoops they disappeared okay let's just have another look now they're gone now okay is that wearing off the russian vlog i think so i mean they're surrounded by cyrillic so i'm just gonna presume that's a yes but i have not studied cyrillic yet so trying to find a city um is gonna be interesting well there's a cool bridge over there let's have a look at that i might be missing a lot of stuff on the way but i want to see what this bridge looks like what does it go across the road cool sorry mesmerized by a bridge that looks awesome so we're on the river i guess look at that all the way into the city okay so we've got trams got a big old bridge big old river by looks of it so could we be one of the bigger cities um i don't know what moscow looks like it has got a big old river is this the floating bridge i wouldn't call it floating exactly though um hmm this is a possibility isn't it okay let's get some decent information um guess we should go back to the beginning let's have a look so i thought this building might have a name on it that we could look out for um [Music] so that bridge is in the east and [Music] it could be here could be this one oh i mean [Music] it'll be on this side wouldn't we we oh wake up me right let's get some more information wow okay so go around the river here is it a bend oh i'm concentrating on this river so much probably because i can't read anything else and let's have a quick look down here oh where have i gone what have i gotten myself into so this is building we started in front of there's that big old bridge okay the card bends around here to the south it could be going down here maybe we're here somewhere all right i'm just gonna have to go for something i know maybe we're down here i wish i knew what that building was okay i'm just gonna go for this here because i spent too long on this already um i didn't see a big cathedral though but let's see let us see should have known should have known vladivostok well what was this bridgeton okay points oh god okay well at least it was the right country so i recognized the flag next one try again right uh this flag i do not recognize either wonderful what else we got going on oh this flag i recognize so uh iran not sure [Music] um okay this building say okay is this oh okay i'm not good at flag still so i don't know what this flag is about there's both flags so that must mean something um i don't even recognize any of those words is it for a place are we not i'm not sure we're in iran looks like apple is the name of the place we are in um it's a malaysian flag okay let's have a look malaysia you know a place called april not that i can see probably being blind um having a very quick scan which is probably not the best thing to do it does look like we're near a border maybe we're near here now maybe april is not the name for city maybe it's an area like this damn i was hoping for some easy onesie um philippines no no first walk around but i don't think it is uh uh where are we i don't think it is no okay i think it is malaysia let's have a look what this is down here and then i'll think i'll just search for a place called ipoh so there it is again april tourist information center this must be where we are so i'm gonna scour malaysia for okay i swear i've looked over every inch of malaysia and i cannot find this place i'm going to be so mad when it comes up the only place i have found is this one tan ipo so this is where i'm going to put myself i'm ah oh sorry i thought i was going to find it i hope we are in malaysia at least i've got countries right then hey let's just see cat hasn't helped either of course okay so we were in malaysia there's nothing here that says if oh really just there just on that level and then gone again oh that's so annoying that's so dying oh no oh well that makes me feel a bit better i don't think i would have spotted that at all okay not too bad on points not as punishing as a russian one man i better get easier after this let's try the next one not indoors oh i recognize this flag too but i can't remember ah so i'm still rubbish with flags basically okay what we got going on here oh this is a weird angle a libra in some kind of university or something this is same no [Music] sure um is that the only way that we can go oh fantastic um i don't like this game okay come on right what do we think middle east um [Music] i'm not sure what yemen's flag looks like um not sure kuwait what does kuwait's flag look like i'm not sure bahrain hmm i like bahrain i'm gonna go here um university maybe general books hall reference and periodicals hall library very weird very strange let's pick somewhere over here [Music] university or a library or something um i'm gonna pick this one over here let's have a look oh okay good right country again okay so i'm doing all right on the countries not an amazing guest but you get a cultural center okay all right not bad let's chat me up a bit come on for the next two yeah okay right that's great can't see that um [Music] i mean i'm getting american vibes but let's have a look michigan senate okay so that must be a state flag i guess um where so i guess this is the capital of michigan which is up here um [Music] i don't know that's detroit because that's not always how it works out is it so let's have a look at detroit first do you have a capital with an o hill um capital city so maybe um am i being blind no but hello foreign oh right i'm gonna have a look around i'm probably gonna speed this up i might move to another city and have a look around there i'm not convinced we're in detroit i'll see you in a bit [Music] okay so it was lansing not detroit so it was right um so here's this capital we were [Music] looking at this building i think so let's get back to the beginning so we were [Music] ign street we were at the other side of the building by this overpass and this street name was come onto the wimba walnut walnut here so it's a overpass we're down here right yeah it must be here yes i think we're there let's go yes okay good last round finally um where's the flat ow i guess there used to be flags up there i'm not being blind am i i think so right so let's pop here see some flags appear no um let's go over here was that a flag up there oh there are some flags there look blind brazil and sure not russia again are we oh please no no no no no no what's this oh no we are we're in russia again oh finish the game how we started i guess right let's see if i can do better this time oh so painful i'm sorry guys painful game what does this say does that say something useful to me probably okay stop crying and let's work this out so let's see if we can find [Music] a big road with some good road signs on it maybe um [Music] let's try down here serve me right for not learning some cyrillic read isn't it um but then i have to recognize a sh city name or um this is not gonna go well so wish apple center of where i'm sure one of these signs probably tells me that okay do i spend a long time or do i plonk it again [Music] and hope there's something oh what's that a big shiny building no road numbers on there so oh this looks like a fairly big city but there are many of those what else can i get it seems every city has a tram um come on i want this you want this i want this i'll probably speed up this looking around as well because i'm going to try and find something of use and i will let you know if i do but i don't hold out that much hope okay i can't find anything that i can i can use or work on um so i'm gonna plonk it um here i've chosen this city um yeah let's see who knows could be a okay that's close-ish see that's a lot smaller than i thought right so many places so close together but that looks okay that is quite big such a vast country all right i really need to learn my cyridic i don't know if i'd be able to find anything that would have helped though but i should have gone for moscow would have been close never mind got the right countries that's what i'm taking away from this so school's pretty bad look at that but i got the right countries in each one so i am taking that as a win and i really hope you guys did better than me because that was dismal that was terrible ah those rush arounds but never mind it was an okay game i don't feel like i've learnt much in the way of flags but um getting the right country suggests that maybe i have but um maybe i'll do it again another couple of months let me know how you guys did in the comments below thank you very much for watching and i will see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 43.11597723599645, "lng": 131.8842869717432}, {"round": 2, "lat":

"hello welcome back another geography along um and today it's another subscriber map so helena has sent me this challenge to play her map of one location from every country which looks very hard so this could be a very long game but we'll see i'm up for the challenge hopefully we'll get lucky with the rounds and they'll be nice and gentle but i don't know how much hope uh i'm gonna drag you guys along to do the challenge with me so let's see how hard this map is going to be so let's set this is a challenge the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and uh probably beat me let's see where we are right um hmm okay seems like a photosphere but we can move which is nice this is just lamppost okay so this is taken by i can't pronounce that but it looks like venezuelan 360 g so i can only presume we're in venezuela um let's have a look what we can find um i don't know any of the metadata like um license plates and stuff to confirm this is venezuela um and tonight can we trust a compass on this let's see so where's the sun do we think probably over there somewhere so let's move away from the tree just to confirm but have a look at these street signs if we can i don't hmm so all right sun there you are so kind of in the north um not really sure on that um let's look down here come on one of these signs just oh oh no no no no i hope one of these signs might say what city we're in um so that looks like it's got an address on it but i just just can't see that um okay okay let's move on now come on i'm gonna find something otherwise i might just make a guess but be nice to find something um can't go that way anyway oh this is the furthest we can go wonderful i think so back up here we could go the other way let's see no nope no no no right um let's just check if there's any other ways we can go this is where we started isn't it i think that is it yes okay so venezuela um really don't know much about venezuela it doesn't look like a big place i don't think and there's a park with a statue in it maybe i'll just have a look at some [Music] medium-sized towns see if i can find a park with a statue in it um just wondering if that's a name there probably have to be more zoomed in to see i guess um doesn't look mountainous because i can't see anything else up on a hill that makes sense um okay okay what to do i think i am going to look in some social thinking if i go for just the bold ones i think those places are too big they're bigger than this place let's just have a quick look here for instance oh that's not that big is it really like park here but that's don't think there was a pond or what have you in there um something like this let's plonk us here a minute oh we weren't there though we were out on the street hmm that was a church or something wasn't it so that's a good thing to try and find as well so i might just do that i'm gonna have a scan about i'm not gonna drag you with me i will speed this up and um i don't know see what i can find i might just pop back down here and see if i can get an address off that sign but i don't think i'm gonna be able to work out anything from here so frustrating such a shame okay i'm gonna scan about see what i can find and i will see you guys soon [Music] okay i don't think i'm going to find it randomly looking at places um so i found this place here that has a church and a park near it i don't know if this is the one it doesn't look like it but i'm going to just plonk it and and see if it's randomly good i don't think so or at least near to it so let's see let's see how far we've got oh that's not bad is it next town along wow i didn't see that i didn't zoom in enough i don't know if i even went to that place actually well i'll take it i mean that's not bad cool okay good good start maybe hey you guys did you spot something that i missed could you read the sign somehow i don't know but i'm very happy with that guess that's really good right next one um okay so this is official coverage um and i don't already know [Music] maybe south africa look sun is i guess behind these clouds here hmm i don't really know where's the shadows going that way so probably about here north-ish not sure about that okay we can move but um no where are we going to move to uh let's go over here i mean it could be australia for all i know i don't really think it's new zealand i know there's sheep here oh they're goats they are goats okay so let's move along this road is that a termite hill yeah i'm still thinking maybe south africa let's carry on see where we go a little adventure okay little village nice signs obviously no shops can we move more okay doggo still a little village um [Music] i don't know how far we can go until we hit a road maybe let's see let's carry on i'm in this game for the long haul so i'm not going to worry too much about taking too much time um still think in south africa at the moment cows donkey oh hello okay come on excuse me right come on we can get somewhere can we we're literally just in the middle of nowhere which will be very hard to pinpoint so i'm not gonna try and pinpoint here i don't think okay first sign restricted area unauthorized access prohibited can't read the rest but that's in english not in afrikaans so what does that tell me not really sure what is this as well there's a nice building over there um so let's see more of that building see what it is some kind of warehouse or something maybe should we've gone that way oh decisions at least it's not timed i'm gonna take my time i might speed this up going down this road if it takes a while but i'm gonna go somewhere hopefully [Music] okay so i've gone all the way around this airport this fence so i saw an assign that it says by airport authority or something like that so i've seen nothing else i've been bitten trance following this google cars journey so i'm still thinking it's south africa i'm gonna go and have a look in south africa and uh pop it somewhere i don't know where pop it somewhere how could it be botswana hmm i'm gonna stick with south africa i don't really know where though not really good with south africa so um um maybe up here somewhere can gonna see an airport probably not probably not gonna be able to see an airport hey um looks a bit too busy up here though but it's quite big really isn't it um [Music] where am i going to block uh i might plunk it here without zooming in any further i think let's see let's see another one not so bad okay okay i'm quite happy with that as well where were we a fairly big place just on the outskirts of it there's the airport all right there you go okay well i'm glad i've got the right country again i mean the last one was helpful because of who took the picture okay i don't think that's so bad oh no i didn't get the right country it was botswana oh no never mind but still not too far so i'm taking that as a tiny win yeah okay oh no this is a photosphere we cannot move right okay so you got yellows down each side and i know that means something but i cannot remember what that is i think as america's has it yellow down the middle right we're driving on the left wake up me okay and son can we trust that that's pretty much in the west though isn't it so maybe near the equator palm trees that's kind of pile of food or something [Music] yeah definitely driving on the left hmm right not sure [Music] um so i'm going to take take it the word near the equator don't think it's around asia and i don't think it's south america so i'm going to go around africa um so it's a photosphere so it might be a place without official coverage [Music] um quite sandy is that or just dry still fairly green yeah sure maybe maybe kenya but i don't really know what drc looks like or the republic of the congo i don't know what their roads look like what side of the road they're on um [Music] so i'm just gonna go by feeling i don't know i really don't know what else is on the equator here so we've got kenya uganda drc gav on and republic of the congo i'm sticking with the equator thing i've got to go with something it's a fairly big road [Music] who drives on the left i think i'm feeling kenya i think which were we going north east so i should pick a road that's going in the northeast direction very straight road are we going northeast pretty much north okay okay okay i reckon i'm gonna go republic of the congo because never really get that come up feeling that no let's go slap in the middle drc on this road here let's have a look let's see completely wrong i had to get one like that really mozambique it's not one that's really ever come up for me in a map wow quite near a town really ah that's good no mozambique drive on the left that's a good thing to know and have yellow down the sides i'll try and remember that i probably won't that's a big gap oops what did i press in um wow right well let's hope that's the only one that's big distance let's try the next one nearly there and cool coastal asia pacific one jeff so it should be in the asian pacific i guess what else can we get from here now can we trust compass can't even really see the sun can we yeah but we can move so let's have a look we can see over here in this park i'll have a look at the license plate but i don't know anything about those so you oh okay oh up high i want to have a look at that i'm sure that's got information on it nope let me look let me have a look it's not gonna okay all right right whoa so the i hate it when going wobbly like that let me get more stable picture well oh okay so c is to the south looks like the sun is there somewhere i don't know if i trust that i have to go with the c being south because what else can i go with nothing else in the car right where else can we go here see your house over here can we get to that nope okay can we go out here this way nope let me go back over there please okay this is handy global reach initiative grid pacific.com right i think it's a case of finding this yeah island i can't go oh i like my i got myself stuck somehow okay i can't see any arrows but i can't move anywhere else i can't see that right pacific it could be all of this as well couldn't it said asia so let's have a look wow there's so much here isn't there yeah okay let's see if we can get this in the corner kind of really doesn't say on it does it okay so it looks like then there's an atoll there and a main bit of land let's have a look through everything okay let's find it let's find it i'm gonna have a scan around i might well speed this up because there's a lot to look at um and i will be back now this kind of looks like the right shape but it's kind of missing this atoll up here but maybe that's just not on the map am i just trying to make it look like the right shape i will carry on looking but tonga maybe okay i haven't seen anything else that looks similar so i'm gonna go with tonga i'm wrong it could be very painful in points i was just missing this bit up here but maybe it's just not on the map i guess this is because this could be water this bit in here right which would match up with that i think it's here and we're on the southern tip right so is it this this looks too sandy tsunami rock yeah i like tsunami rock maybe the compass is wrong uh because it was quite rocky we were on what we were on right um yeah i'm gonna go with this look out here show any detail let's go back to the beginning you can see something sticking out there a bit around there and then really nothing else can't go around could do just on a rocky bit um there's a house there as well maybe i'll go here the cliffs overlook the road going to it all right i'm going to hit it let's try that let's see if we're even in the right country i should just take where it was up here see now we're looking closer but 8.6 miles the right island very lucky to see that picture on the top of the car oh okay let's see what the last round gives us i hope you guys having fun with this this is really quite fun because i wasn't expecting to get high points so i'm pretty happy right now uh where are we here so a bit more in the middle of stuff here um caught a fly okay so we are driving on the left again can't really see many of these or i can see them but i can't read them um i can't read that sign i presume that is c over there and if we go by sun which is right there [Music] i suggest we're in the northern hemisphere could be in asia though so um i mean we might be on another island touristy very touristy island oh palm trees same driving on the left sun is in the south if the compass can be trusted i think it may be caribbean um not jamaica but i'm not sure shame we can't move oh okay wow well done me that's so clever right okay let's get some information um i still can't read that southern main road cool cool those are very english speaking um let's see what that sign says southern main road where else can we go this way let's try give us anything new uh how are you setting um i can't read that good view of the place look so it's quite a big bay mountains maybe volcanic i don't know um a little bit further down here and see we can see um probably just saying about the works okay i thought that might give us something okay so let's go back to the beginning can we go back this way maybe get something point 14 m2 ring road sunset ridge okay i think we can work with this i think still think we're around here so m2 ring road that should be fairly easy to spot right um just trying to think which ones drive on the left um point fourteen and two ring road sunset bridge [Music] i'm not gonna let this last round beat me i've got information i should be able to find it i think i found it i've managed to find this sign here that's got to charles and princess town i also found another sign that said to san fran san fernando so we've got princess town here san fernando can't see saint charles um [Music] it's got to be somewhere though right so is this the m2 and the m2 ring road so say hmm so where are we san fernando was nearby it's been annoying i can't find the m2 southern main road we saw a sign for that let's plunk us here a minute right that's beginning right this was assigned to the southern main road wasn't it southern main road does that mean this is the southern main road well that's the southern paint road oh let's have a look so this is the southern main road it's quite long i want to see if i can get this pin pointed because that would be cool [Music] i wonder if we're around here hang on look m2 ring road i think we're here i think we're here yes i think we're there i think it's here i think he's here how many times i'm gonna say that right i think we might have found it let's hope for the best i'm gonna do it and see can we get a perfect score on the last round come on yes we can wonderful right that was a very long game but i accepted the challenge let's see what the final score was eighteen nine nine seven i'm very happy with that very happy with that i think we were quite lucky that was a bad one that was a very bad one and i got the wrong country here but not too far away so yeah yeah i'll take it very happy thank you very much for the challenge helena that was great um i'm happy to accept more challenges it pushes me a bit so uh yeah that was really good let me know how you guys did in this in the comments below did you manage to beat me because i don't think that's such a bad score on this map i'm going to take it as a big win let me know how you guys did if you want to suggest another map for me to try let me know in the comments as well and i will see you next time bye ", "locations":

"hello welcome back to another geographer play along um i had a request to do another us map at the usa so i had a look at what's popular this month and i found this map which is not the same as the state one i did before this is state capital buildings maybe that's easier probably not for me maybe it is maybe it isn't but let's have a go see if i retained any information from the last time i did it i don't think i can obviously i didn't cover every state so let's see it's probably not going to be great but let's give it a go so the link to play along will be in the description below if you would like to and let's see if i know anything about the states at all right what is this grand building look at this that pirate flag um okay let's caught with the pills okay i mean are we in washington or something is that the state capital of maryland i'm really confused bank street um [Music] no what do you say virginia virginia hmm virginia where's virginia um right yeah virginia here washington what washington and virginia and it's just on the other side oh right that's handy is it right on the border yeah look well never knew that never knew that okay so we're in virginia so virginia state capital would be [Music] richmond i've heard of williamsburg as well where'd that go huh newport news what okay let's try richmond let's have a look um i suppose it'd be in the center court end sounds cool represent a court building white house confederacy um virginia state capital here we go that looks good um [Music] capital street old city hall and we're outside a court u.s court of appeals so we must be here right okay so 10th street and bank i forgot about those bank street 10th street yes okay this wasn't so brutal right outside yeah so here come on for the zero yards one yard okay i know the states i don't at all let's see what we get next um [Music] that's a pretty cool looking building i have to say and this is the state capital state library knowledge history justice can we read anything in the front here um here right capital avenue yeah state library of i can't make out anything on there state library something court is that connecticut something of connecticut hmm should we see if we can do this one no moving yeah connecticut 91. oh some nice stuff right here so connecticut uh i wonder what's on that side probably that state library i guess okay stop muttering trinity college okay let's try and do this no moving connecticut oh i've forgotten that already right where is connecticut i'm probably saying that wrong as well um why can't i see it am i being well yes i'm a bit dumb to the states connecticut there it is this one isn't it yeah okay so is it hartford or new haven or one of the other smaller places let's look in hartford first um sure would be in the center wouldn't it if it was here if this was the right place oh trinity college there was a sign to that wasn't there okay so frog hollow what's that that sounds cool um right don't get distracted although it's not time so we can chill where would the state buildings be um [Music] i'm presuming they'll be listed on the map that might be a little silly that's capital avenue so it'd be around here somewhere right and where's the capital library we were in front of museum that's a public library is that the same thing oh i don't know hmm that's the state capital building here the purpose there is that what i can see here and then behind us should be this state library are we on the road 91. i mean you won maybe that number means something else okay zoom in [Music] law library museum of connecticut history legislative office building and then uh theatre so this building is kind of northeast which kind of makes sense so this way should be this legislative building this way is don't look like a theater maybe oh yeah look that's the top of it there so yes we should be here so come on oh two yards okay that's good this is very good okay let's try the next one i hope you're not laughing at my pronunciation of some places um right this a very nice looking place again historic illinois route 66 historic business district illinois all right 66. and i guess that is the capital building and this is something else courts again maybe not sure that looks like a capital building again let's try and do this without moving so illinois on the route 66 uh gotta find it there it is uh so can i presume chicago isn't the state capital where's the historic route 66 because it's not hmm hmm there's 67 61 where does the state go down here down here let's have a scan around for route 66. 61. nope we've gone over the line right so is it around the 67 is it even gonna be on the map it might not be so so where could the capital b let's zoom out again so i can see it's quite a big state actually isn't it so let's have a look in springfield um um so this is presidential library up there and it said historic business district or something again i don't know that's going to be marked on here um anything that suggests this is the right place the state museum old state capital does that mean there's a new state capital and this ain't it in no more hmm former state capital i'm so confused now i'm going to put my thing here so is it just that it moved further somewhere else but it's still in springfield there's route 66 okay okay okay so route 66 hotel and conference center does that mean this 55 is what was 66 let's have a look up here what can we see department of human services um what does it just disappear oh that goes this way i presume i follow 55. um well that's kind of oh this is really confused me for some reason right let's let's move this is the only solution was that a train track ah there was a train track here i saw i saw here here's the train train is going over in the east so that kind of lines up with this this road is stops here to the west so maybe i can find a road that stops to the west with a grand old building um here no there no what what am i missing here there's also a train line here ah okay i ain't gonna move because this is not this is not going well for me so let's zoom down here there's a road number it's a second and capital avenue so i saw capitol avenue up here right no where's that on the other place so let's have a look at second street here second jefferson street washington capital avenue this is the state building wow i'm a bit slow aren't i very slow so this is the train track that goes over that we can see right let's go back to the beginning see if we can get good yardage again so there's roads there [Music] i'll probably go by the front of this building so we're probably around here let's try that nine yards but still four points i am very surprised i hope you guys are doing well i thought i'd be a lot worse at this and i'm going to try and do no musing while i can but california i think so i'm not great with state capitals it's always a city or a town that you just don't think it should be just by size i guess obviously populations move but does that look like the golden gate bridge i think so let's have a look the wrong way san francisco golden break is to the west so we should be over this way somewhere in theory if we're even in san francisco no wait i said that to the west although that doesn't work that doesn't work does it but there must be could be over here somewhere um oakland there's another amazing bridge oh man san francisco is big okay isn't what is it what is it okay so anything else i can see before i start moving about what does that say probably capital avenue or some such are you the capital let's have a look are you the state capital where would the capital buildings be hmm all of justice i might speed this one up if it takes me a while because i'm feeling i'm staring blindly and not really taking it in but i want to find it i'm on a perfect score so i cannot let it down now i'm sure the last round will do that for me anyway um so i'm going to continue looking around san francisco if not then i'll move down [Music] i guess where else could be sacramento baker's field i don't think it's la somehow um yeah oh i will be back once i found this place [Music] i think i found it can a fallen year state capital park capital museum capital mall or mal as you would say are we here oh yeah did i do it without moving is that that circular bit and then the building here i think so i think we're here yes oh i'm very excited about this possibly getting a perfect score on the united states capitals right pinpoint so we must be on this one here right on the junction let's see how accurate it is here let's go let's go oh nine yards again but still perfect score i've already forgotten to place sacramento i'll try and remember that i should know that ah right let's see what the last round throws at me come on protest cool okay um i don't know what these flags are i don't know what they're protesting where are you protesting there's a spike come on what do you call them obelisk maybe okay so again these flags i just don't know them no idea no idea don't recognize them we're in central wherever say cool tax haven you cult hello collax how are you um [Music] anything else can i do this one no moving i don't think so what does that say i don't know i don't know no idea oh i think i'm gonna have to move on this one no i don't know what this is either it's like a massive building back there as well i know what that is ah okay which way do i go i feel like that banner might have something for us let's have a look democracy history colorado colorado right here we go with the searching for the state first um colorado is a state isn't it or is that a place ah shows you how bad i am at this time um there it is okay so we in denver feels like denver should be state capital but that doesn't have oh capitol hill right here okay come on last round so cheese man park wow colorado state capital here we go civic center park that's that big building we can see in the distance where is this the spike is it a lincoln memorial that makes sense because the lincoln memorial is like that isn't it so this must be it here wells fargo atm [Music] in the capital building of course right let's go back to the beginning some big old steps going up to the east which yup makes sense i don't think we're on this path we've got to be on lincoln street i could move to confirm it but i am being stubborn so this goes down to here to this memorial and that big building here see you got broadway mall park and that big round i think it's there i think it's there and i think i'm not on that side are we no i think we're here and i really want to get perfect score so right in the middle of the road aren't we so let's go here come on one yard yes yes that mean perfect a perfect score a perfect score on state capitals granted they're all relatively easy and i'm very thankful for that but a perfect score yay oh lovely now i'll have to do this again in a month and see if i retained any of that information let me know how you guys did you didn't beat me obviously you might have got closer but i think that was quite close and a lot of those probably done it quicker because you probably know where the states that we're looking for our state capital but that's made me feel good maybe i'm getting better hmm let's do this again sometime and see how well i do let me know how you did in the comments and i will see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 37.53790779725747, "lng":

"hello welcome back to another geographic play along a little different this time well i suppose not different it's still legit i guess a map play along but this is a map made by one of my subscribers alistair so thank you very much it is a map about cats so as they say here places called cat will have cat in their name not necessarily in english which is going to make it a bit harder we'll see um they say they can't even get a full score on it because there's some obscure places so this is gonna be an interesting one i think um not gonna do it timed just a nice gentle play along hopefully i won't lose patience trying to find some of these places um so let's give this one a go thank you very much alistair maybe one of the cats will join us while we're playing we'll see right so let's set this is no no limits at all and challenge link as always will be in the description below if you want to play along and um let's start the game let's see what we've got okay so here's the first cat thing black cat cafe pub bar lunch they do everything right where are we um because maybe hungarian yes so we are in hungary um but where let's see what this sign says i guess that's also to the car box okay signed to budapest lovely so this might be not too hard let's see so we've got some road numbers let's get in there hungry and there's budapest uh so 5e 75 and the 441 so 5 and e 75 go to budapest so hopefully we'll find it around here well there's a five so e75 are those smaller roads oh there's an e60 right shall we try and find i don't know how to pronounce that segwit think i have no good with hungarian um right so maybe we need to try and find four four one so there's 4 30. um right on the border here how big is this road 441 [Music] i mean do these little roads have numbers nice of names so 441 i'm gonna say now i might speed this up if it takes me a while um because i always forget to say that and then i don't know how to edit it nicely um hopefully you see these are all eights up here so it looks fairly um logical so fours plus myself now already so falls around here look lots of fours around here so maybe we'll be able to find four four one around here there's four four two four four two um gonna remember to look out for this name here there's a full full one so do we think we're in this place let's see do you think that restaurant cafe bar lunch will be listed on here okay so now i've found four for one found this place so that says it's to the northeast budapest is to the north west there's budapest gone okay north west so maybe are hmm four four one going to this place so have to be around here somewhere maybe we are in this place okay so i've got a good feeling about this because we've got the full full one here the five going up there so i reckon we gotta be around here somewhere [Music] i'm gonna go with it i'm gonna go with this road i know it's not quite right i'm obviously missing something but i feel like it's around here so i am going to do it oh further down it is listed i just didn't see it i didn't spend enough time there's the road wow but only two points lost okay i'm happy so my feeling was right it was around here i just didn't spend enough time looking for it okay let's try the next one let's maybe spend more time all right fat cat cafe are we in the uk that looks uk e i've never seen a bus stop like that before um right well so we got here murphy mullen estate agents eu badges maybe we're in ireland um marine is beauty salon numbers are slightly odd so yeah maybe we're in ireland uh let's see what this church has to say like give us some clues can i get close to it raskar village okay pestpaterion press i can never say that one press what are those one of those ones i.e yeah so we are in ireland place called rasgaar village um now i need to work out where in island that is because i know nothing about ireland so definitely rascal it says over here rascal late night pharmacy okay got to find a road sign with some road numbers um which way is going to give us that i mean this looks like a main road let's have a look down here and oh i got bins bins where'd those bins go i can hear a cat running around so we might get a cat appearance on the cat map um key waste no no county or anything like that on there um okay let's carry on i think this is not the right way to go to find a road number um but i'm going with it i'm gonna stick with it come on gotta be a road somewhere right oh maybe that road name no nope yeah i definitely think i was chosen the wrong way to go bmw service sometimes they say an area no no all right i'm going to go back to the beginning okay let's choose this way um [Music] got to be something i mean it's quite big for a village dublin letting company maybe it's a village that got incorporated into dublin let's have a look because this is boring just trying to find a road sign so dublin is here and we're looking for rascal um there's quite a lot going on here isn't there rust cool close but not right let's zoom in a bit more there's rascal lovely um right which road were we on should have looked but there was a church rathgar village church um now here we go fat cat cafe roughly all right let's go back to the beginning pretty much right outside it so let's get this dead on shall we here it's kind of in between both of them the church behind us so let's say here right come on yes two yards lovely okay not bad so far i have a feeling it's gonna get worse so let's see cafe gato cool cafe gato oh so cacao experience that doesn't mean much to me and the quality is pretty poor [Music] um says gonzalo gonzalez de vega gotchas gotcha he's doing the footage cacao experience is that a place no sun to really see um let's see where he's going see can we get anything off this church or maybe monastery uh you've got any web addresses not that i can see um bus nope okay let's carry on it's getting sunnier maybe we'll find a sun spot sounds weird doesn't it um oh [Music] i think so darn right oh you've got these electricity things on the outside now they're in mexico there's a road named calais mercedes which is usually used in spain or spanish um so maybe it is mexico hmm um can't read that one [Music] um about this hey okay let's get down the end of this road see if it gives us anything else then i might just have a look at mexico um nothing there for me anyway um [Music] quite a big road ah is that a flag well that doesn't help me hey cat there you go there's a cat for your cat map um yeah let's see what this building has to offer yeah i'm not sure it's mexico now lisa national i'm sure i've seen a van like that somewhere yeah that's definitely not the mexican flag this makes me think it's an island um hmm okay let's have a look i think it's an island and i think i saw that in nassau that truck but i don't know this is nasal um does this necessarily have official coverage hey i'm not really sure uh do you have calais as your street names not really so i think i'm wrong don't think it is okay let's just check some other places quickly okay no right i will definitely speed this up i'm gonna look across some of these islands and excuse me see which ones have calais as their road names i mean that one doesn't even have any road names so it's gonna be fun all right i will see you in a bit once i found something something to go on i don't know what though yes i'll see you in a bit [Music] [Music] okay i can't i don't i have no idea i don't know what that flag is so i settled on dominican republic and this place santiago de los caballeros and somehow while i was looking around i found a place called um cacao which is the same name that's on this car so i have had a good look around i can't find the cafe um or the road name and it's probably not even here but um this is as close as i'm getting i think so i'm just gonna pop it here and see where we were right okay right country i thought santa domingo had uh official coverage well i didn't bother looking around there oh well never mind let's see where we were cafe ah never mind never mind but i'm happy it's the right country hopefully i do know their flag subconsciously or something okay but again not too bad a hit on the point so i feel like i'm doing all right i hope you guys are doing well you probably knew the flag went to the capitol found calais mercedes and everything was perfect right let's see what we get next okay welcome to the catlins 200 meters on the right so does that mean we're driving on the left maybe uh in the middle of nowhere cool so let's travel 200 meters i said on the left and i on the right well let's see let's see what this place is get a feel for where we are i know my first thought was new zealand um this is a hostel okay uh no other signs excuse me can't go in there i don't know what else that says okay let's carry on the catalan another sign is it come on main entrance to hostel telford campus there's a place in the uk called telford i don't think it's the same place so telford campus is it a university what's this sign say one more so dunny didn't i've heard of that oh i've heard of that what do you say and this says nugget point all right so this road is fairly straight south north road i think i'll have more luck finding dunedin now is that australia is that new zealand it's one of these two i think it's new zealand there it is yep okay dunedin and bull closure that's there a wacko is the other place it's pointing to so maybe we're in between here and it was telford campus wasn't it so seven kilometers to the north and then 90 to dunedin which is way up there so we must be around here somewhere maybe on one of these roads um i can't find the cat place i can't see it nugget point that was on that other sign this sign down here wasn't it let's quickly look down here nugget point kaka point so we must be around here somewhere um can't see point beach green park camp telford here we go right so where's cat thing where is captain is it that no no i think we're there right okay so we must be near here somewhere let's go back to the beginning welcome to the catlins there's nothing about catlins on here zoom in a bit more nope very strange telfa southern institute of technology here to presume is this so one of these must be the main entrance maybe this one and we're just coming up to this one which is not a main entrance so i reckon we're probably around here somewhere and what else can we spy to help us not a lot really let's have a quick look down here come on quick there's a little track there i don't think that's going to be on the map um [Music] some of them what's this building quite a way down here and we have this road and doesn't have a cow road so that's cal rose set we're definitely down here i'm gonna stick with this spot here i know good with distances on these maps is that 200 meters i don't know let's see let's find out oh oh lost a point needed to be a bit closer okay but i am happy with that 499 fourth i can't even say numbers now let's just skip on to the next one last round so so far not too punishing and hopefully you guys have had the same luck um elgato so i presume gato then is cat in spanish bienvenue and that's french right um where are we i think a very international place let's say big konica minolta building oh okay okay embarrass myself with flag now so that is the dutch flag i hope so because my mum will kill me um so where are we some kind of business park i presume does that say oh luxembourg uh i'm an idiot i'm such an idiot right um let's get some more details from here maybe so that's why there's some french around and other stuff going on isn't it um lots of stuff going on here though isn't there um i'm so embarrassed i thought that was a dutch flag right zoned activities and ban right so a lot of international companies here maybe we can just find this place somehow so i'm going to presume it's around the outskirts um [Music] i think maybe it won't be that easy to spot the reality it could be anywhere couldn't it i don't know what amban means [Music] again i'm gonna say now i might speed this up okay well that didn't take long found an ban not too badly have to zoom in to find that and here is elgato let's see let's get an exact spot shall we so pretty much right in front of the building zoom right in here shall we see what's behind us there's a car park entrance for yeah i guess so i think probably here got full points on the last round yes nice oh that was a really good fun map thank you very much alistair i really enjoyed that luckily i don't think i've got two obscure places so it was fun and hopefully you guys also enjoyed it because i don't think those rounds were too bad at all and they're really fun nice variety of places let's have a look at the summary 24 487 is not bad and a good spread across the world i think which is a nice change yeah really enjoyed that one thank you very much let me know how you did in the comments below give alistair's map a like as well because i think he's done a good job thank you very much for watching and i will see you next time ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 46.90749755146305, "lng": 19.6959769316615}, {"round": 2, "lat": 53.31247650698767, "lng": -6.273777275705032}, {"round": 3, "lat":

"hello welcome back to another geoguessr play along i thought we'd do something nice and gentle and different today so i found this map hard rock worldwide so i thought it might be fairly gentle a little bit easy apparently not too easy according to this score but a nice gentle play along for a saturday or sunday or the weekend so let's start this game so there's a challenge link will be in description below if you want to play along and let's start the game right hard rock cafe shop cancun i presume this is in cancun then which is in mexico right yeah see see if we can spot it straight off right there's quite a lot going on in cancun near the front um okay maybe i should look around might be a good idea hey i thought maybe we could spot it quite quickly but i don't think so okay let's have a look so oh we're in a super supermarket shopping center and i don't know what the name is so let's pop outside no we can't pop outside hmm okay um this is cancun cancun reef so they were definitely in cancun um [Music] it doesn't say what the shopping center is called i think the terrace and le terrazza hmm okay okay we're just gonna have to [Music] scour around i don't know much about pancakes so where do we think so there's a shopping mall here um that's it what's it say at the terrace in the terrazza to me that sounds like it's on the front somewhere so there's not a whole lot going on here isn't unless it's down here looks like hotels and things so i still think it's going to be along the front here somewhere but it is inside a shopping center so i don't know if it will be listed on the map this out zoom out to mountainous um right i guess do we look in every shopping mall um yeah i think what else we could do maybe start with the one closest to the the front um no i might well speed this up if i'm gonna end up looking at every single shopping mall it's gonna be a bit annoying isn't it [Music] [Music] okay i can't find it anywhere i'm spending far too long on this um i found a couple of possibilities nothing that says hard rock on it um now i can't find it there was one that said hollywood and then this american plaza here so oh here you go plaza hollywood or plaza los americas so i'm gonna go with this one i can't see it here um but there is a haagen-dazs which i did see in this place so maybe it is here and it's just not on the map i don't know uh so annoying for the first first one but i'm gonna pop us here and um let's see right so it could have been on the hotel place there's haagen-dazs and there's a hard rock oh never mind i only lost a few points on that ah i didn't even bother looking i thought there's just hotels over there it's called hotel zone useless well i hope you guys persevered a bit more than me or you know thought that there could be something out here oh so rubbish all right moving on on to the next one level several lovely so i guess well just because the flags i don't mean we're in america because no we're in america old town trolley where has old town trolleys um so no don't know uh might be obvious to some of you where has old town trolleys not to me i'm afraid national park service okay what national park okay so we've got some right signs over here so luke um where lincoln's legacy lives still doesn't mean anything to me um let's have a look see if we can oh more trolleys washington okay i didn't want to presume so ah get out of the way trolley um oh this is washington welcome center over there well done oh i have a fun time aren't i okay so we are east street north west i guess that means some adam two swords over there and tenth street and 10th street is going very north south right should be able to get this one please all right um i guess we're in the center um 10th street so there's 11 12 13 10 that says south west right um [Music] let's see ah don't go too far no i can't see it now can i see on the other side no okay wonderful oh fbi police wow so 10th street northwest and e street northwest so that's north street northwest um so this is the right tenth street i just gotta find the right junction and hopefully it will have the place written on it l street k street is it just e street maybe g e here we go washington welcome center hard rock cafe perfect let's go back pretty much right outside the front door i would say here 10 yards okay i shouldn't have moved but good better like it next one please are we indoors hello smiley people michael renan this is taken by okay don't know where that is all is one um right this is not going to be easy for leisure don't know um some cool guitars around here though and it's all written in english but that might just be because it's a hard rock cafe fortaleza read this alex does that look english so look at this one no safe sound language is that oh oh i don't know does your shirt say nothing that i can read right cool do you guys know where would you start essa messa free don't know was it spanish sada okay right frozen again uh i guess i'm gonna start looking somewhere some where south america it's like like a holiday place doesn't it [Music] i don't know where to begin [Music] um water is that the name of the place it's got to be the name of the place um i don't know why i think it's central south america but i can't see anything jumping out of me with that name but i will have to speed this up because i'm clueless and this will take me ages um and i probably won't find it because i can't leave this place and see anything else um yeah i will see you in a bit [Music] okay not had much fun with this um but i found a place a fort uh in san juan called fortaleza so it's the only thing i can find i've even had a look around spain um i can't find anything there i haven't found um a hard rock here but i don't know where else to go and i don't want to spend too long looking when i have no idea i mean i've got it in my head that it's a coastal place where people go on holiday um but that's all i've got i don't i don't know don't know so i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna plunk it here uh [Music] so there's no hard rock cafe here this is the fort um maybe i'll pop it here oh right come on let's see where we were i didn't even look down didn't i look down there that's so stupid probably because i had convinced myself it was spanish no [Music] no well it was on the coast all right it's probably somewhere people going on he's quite zoomed out you could see that name oh i'm not having a game you guys are doing better 271 points wow okay let's try for the next one fourth street live all right uh sports and social club so we're probably in america again um [Music] louisville louisville in america the saint louis there's louisville lewisville how do you pronounce it probably not louisville i guess lewisville i don't know but here we are found that good fourth street live lovely and this must be the little thing we're on so uh where's the where's the hard rock where's the hard rock there's sports and social club there's a sports and social club so that's that the hard rock should be opposite there's that stare thing i guess is it now whiskey dry it's having on fourth tavern on fourth okay hard rock is not listed does that say the marquee bar so we're outside tavern on fourth here the marquee bar here no strange well we got to be here so let's go 15 yards good got some full points back again right what's the last one going to give us rock shop hard rock cafe sunny sunny sunny place samsung build hsbc where are we say luna park um [Music] what's inside the truck i don't know i don't know okay i'm gonna need to move which way should we go um well there you go i moved santander with again i don't know spanish or maybe portuguese because apparently i can't tell the difference bbva [Music] hmm okay is that flag is that the argentinian flag i think so okay good lucky very lucky so we are south north road ah where am i going so i presume buenos aires but it could be another big city let's have a quick look it's quite a big road going north south so let's have a look at this one this looks big enough um maybe not there's quite a bit green going on here um so let's see if we could find the samsung building this looks like quite i don't know central financial industrial area and we had something here that was luna park what else can we go and there's the hard rock so hard rock is on the right so there is a bit of green around this road but hmm let us see so let's just have a quick scan down here um see what we can see there's a luna park or a hard rock would be great or a samsung building [Music] um [Music] did like there was a train crossing down the road um i'm probably not looking hard enough right let's see so was this essential could this be the crossing it's too big isn't it i'm just zooming a little bit more and to see so no no no no i don't think it's here right what other big rows have we got can we see where the buildings that we've got would be we'll look around a bit more get a street name that would be the best idea wouldn't it let's go down here oh we got still some big old glass buildings there's a sign over here yes this is trains in the middle trains in the middle of the road that is luna park i don't think that's anything let's pop over here a minute let's go over here banco provincia luna park is that like a theater or something maybe uh so i think we're definitely in buenos aires which is good termini [Music] hmm what does that mean is there place called modero maybe so big this place so hmm again i will probably speed this up because yeah obviously overwhelmed by big cities so i will see you in a little bit [Music] okay so it didn't take me that long so i went around luna park and i saw that it said stadium oh no where is it there it is stadium lunar park so i found a stadium here's luna park and i just saw hard rock where did he go there it is here's the hard rock cafe i think we are on this road so let's go back to the beginning okay not that little road so we must be on this road here i would say hopefully yes i think so come on for the last round ah lovely that's not bad i'm happy with that one i'm glad i looked i was getting very overwhelmed with that one but luckily we're in a stadium which really helped others facebook and stuff so that's probably good to remember that quite a lot of the big tall fancy buildings are in this area so i'll try and remember that for next time so what's kind of looking in the right sort of place i'm going to take that how did we do over 20 241 not too bad it wasn't as gentle as i thought it was going to be i mean it pretty much was but we didn't leave the americas at all which is a shame but maybe i'll play this one again because i did enjoy it and it isn't that hard i just don't know anything but let me know how you did in the comments below um what did i miss to work out that it was brazil i mean i feel a bit silly with that one but let me know and i'll see you next time bye you ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 21.1324046837476, "lng": -86.74717519420999}, {"round": 2, "lat": 38.89641020916299, "lng": -77.02596218670683},

"hello welcome back guess what another geographer play along of course um would you like me to do something else like a sparkle game or watch me fail at competitive geoguessr let me know in the comments below what you think about that i have got a different video planned for next week but i'm not going to say much about that now just in case it doesn't go right um but yeah let me know if you want to see me do something else i'm thinking i might also look at twitch but i'm not sure about that so uh let me know what you think in the comments but for now i'm going to do a gentle game of bird's eye view in capital cities i'm too lazy to install the unity script to do the satellite ones um maybe i should just do that maybe i will next week or something but we'll see but for now we're doing this one hopefully it'll be nice and gentle not too hard i'm not going to set any limits but i presume we're not going to be able to move anyway um let's invite you link will be in the description below if you want to play along and now let's start the game oh nighttime right as is gerald took the picture um okay it looks flat but i don't know if it's too dark to see mountains i'd think you probably would be able to not gonna get the sun obviously to give us a hemisphere it's a bit annoying all right let's see what we can read here and that looks like cycle but i don't know i can't really see what the others say look like a cut very strange um okay so we're driving on the right yes headlights are in front driving on the right there's palm trees fairly one level like there's no massive skyscrapers or anything uh it's quite bright over here i don't really have an idea of where this could be it's a shame it's at night because you really can't see as much detail um okay so maybe the cars can give us a clue that looks like a japanese type truck very small little truck but these are all big ones so that doesn't really tell me anything i don't think hmm yeah i'm a bit clueless on this one how about you guys you spotted something you know already i don't think there's anything i'm missing but i mean these palm trees have got to be the main thing to think about i guess um okay this is english words there's no strange script i mean strange to me um [Music] i think maybe an island it seems quite big got to make a decision on where to go right capital cities not every capital city is here um do you think around here it would have an asian script of some kind um i don't think it's australia or new zealand um says probably near the equator for those trees so maybe south america i mean i'd be more i don't actually know what language they speak serenade um or one of these islands is the other my other thought so if i was one of these irons which one would i be i don't think it's puerto rico um all right trinidad no right i don't really know so i am going to go for i'm going to go for um i believe is in the center so i don't know why it doesn't feel like it's on the coast but it might be we just can't see ah [Music] i'm gonna go for belize anyway it's bili's city right and i'm here this is the capital interesting it doesn't look big enough does it okay i'm not gonna go for these right um what's haiti look like that looks quite big i'm gonna go here and i'm just gonna pop it in the middle this zoomed out here let us see [Music] right did not think of morocco at all because of the english that's annoying oh well oh well at least i know what it looks like at night now so maybe another game i don't know not even latitude did i get it right okay let's try the next one at least it's daytime so you can see the color of the room so you can see this mountain range oh a very nice bridge uh football football or is that american football there's no markings on the pitch there's a couple of things here nice big river going through it photo taken by milos kanovick uh like a course would you call that courts okay uh so we are driving on the right where's that flag [Music] not sure not sure what we got down here like an amphitheater like a ruins um so i thought this thought was fairly mediterranean just because of the color of the rose but that doesn't necessarily mean anything um any other sites we can use let's build us okay so oh okay this is a flag that i've seen i don't know what it is there's a football pitch um [Music] damn me and flags right um it looks like that is the flag that's everywhere isn't it okay now i'm thinking european uh where am i thinking um okay let's try and knock these off so it's not romania it's not um what's the vinnie's croatia montenegro i'm not sure not kosovo not serbia i'm not okay albania has a crow on it doesn't it um hmm [Music] i really feel like i should do this or it's one of these um okay so let's look at whether they have rumors going through so don't think it's the georgian flag but let's have a quick look at tibilisi oh well there is a river at a fancy bridge okay there is a river here um have a look at directions i don't know if we can trust a compass on this uh so it's going north east it's quite wiggly quite wiggly but there's a stadium next to it so it could be and let's see can we find a stadium what i might do is speed this up if i take live i need to look at other capital cities [Music] okay i don't think it's montenegro's flag either but let's look oh wait b-max arena but it's here a moment didn't that say b-max it did oh [Music] oh i think we must be here where are the ruins then maybe is that it that's probably it right let's see if we can pinpoint this so there's a bridge these are the ruins so we must be around here is there an old little river yes yes okay we're here yay right let's try it yes oh that's not bad that's not bad at all awesome right let's try the next one i was convinced it wasn't the right flag okay win to wonderland um right so we got kind of reminds me of scandinavia but that's all of those are on the coast all of those capitals nice mountains and a lovely car alarm going off i'm sorry if you could hear that um [Music] so it's quite small oh that river coming from this lake um hmm okay we're driving on the right i guess okay no sorry no thoughts on this one sun if we can trust the sun this high up looks like it's very firmly in the south so we're in the northern hemisphere hopefully that's cool that's a cool spaceship building um okay so is that more city over here so is it maybe bigger than it looks hmm so we're looking for a place with a giant lake but a fairly large lake um and i can't really see much else um there's a little church i don't know what else to go on here no nice forest land and it goes a bit fuzzy i think that's more buildings over there maybe is that a temple and mountains okay let's dive in here so thinking maybe around here um let's go back over here so what we got what about georgia that lake's too big it's a very nice river going through i don't think so there's a nice lake there is a mountain yeah here um a beach is there a beach day i guess so without going south so that would be down here wouldn't it hmm [Music] hmm am i just willing it to be pop is there a minute what else can we see that river it's probably in here somewhere isn't it so um it's quite a wiggly road so it suggests it's going uphill how that is kind of selfless this way i think i'm just trying to will it to be right although that is going oh i'm not sure i'm not sure let's see if there's anywhere else that kind of lines up um where else um i think this is too mountainous and quite flat over here so no tashkent no big bits of water uh where else we got uh just looking for that dot so we've got some mountains got a lake but that doesn't line up to me i think i'm gonna stick with tablesi silly let's find out let's find out oh my god oh my god it was right i lost a point though because i didn't bother trying to really pinpoint it but that's cool i hope you guys got that too that was fun proper bit detective work right let's see what we have next all right we're definitely on the coast to be seas a big cargo ship that appears over here to the east the dark and stormy day it looks like it's a resort type place there's a casino um we got around here little jetties fairly large place i guess so i'm not sure where the clouds might be covering it looks fairly flat back there um goes off into the distance so i can't really tell this is an island see we're driving on the right uh so you know this is a casino a little resort thing going on can't read that i think that's a sheraton logo maybe i don't know what that says there's another casino i'm not sure okay so what direction is the big white c is to the south so i mean my first thought was monaco but i don't know if it quite lines up with monaco i'm not going too fast for myself [Music] there it is right yeah i don't um does it oh there are these pears excuse me is there a casino on the front museum i have casinos in monaco right there's a casino there's a tunnel next to that casino i don't think there's a tunnel here i don't think this is right i don't think so i could be further up here and there's a casino here i see a port over there hold on hold on a minute triangly bit i think that's the wrong shape uh and is there a cape point him i don't know don't know oh hang on well that's out with monaco so that's not that's definitely not where we are right hmm so on the south coast not really sure hemisphere guessing the sun's over there somewhere but i mean it looks like it's dusk and it's a horrible day so i don't think i can use that um so where else do we think we could be yeah actually i think that's a sheraton they're probably all over the world right southern casinos maybe over here what's panama look like there's sheraton there uh is there a casino no i don't think it's here okay again i might speed this up if i go on a real tangent and look around a load of places look at santo domingo um the shape what i think we'll be able to see the airport wouldn't we yeah i don't think that's right okay i'm definitely gonna speed this up i'm looking for south coast capital cities i have a casino or a sheraton [Music] okay i've been everywhere i think i can think of and i can't find anything that matches this is the only place that looks fairly similar i know it's not but um it's got a sheraton that's what i'm coming with and the triangle point here although i can't see this one on the picture but i can't think where else it is it has got two points there so maybe it is here but i very much doubt it so let's have a look i spent all that time looking at it oh no i gotta trust myself more ah why did i not think that lined up ah that was stupid wasn't it oh well but i lost a point lost another point but that's fine oh my god all right all right oh no i don't want to do that thank [Music] it's you again okay okay so a certain bit of disbelief about that right hopefully you're doing good too it's a very nice gentleman kind of i feel good that i've actually been searching rather than just going i don't know plunkett that's just plonk it right last round so some more heavy voltage very thin strip of land here very thin very sunny driving on the left or is that a one-way road oh we're driving on the left okay driving on the left don't know that low oh scott scotia bank isn't that like canada it doesn't look like canada though uh jamaica don't say jamaica could believe it's jamaica uh let's see what else can we see um kennedy maybe oh grace kennedy there we go don't know what that is okay could we be jamaica so we're facing the north west that doesn't really work oh this does compass be wrong could the compass be wrong taken by paul allen isn't that character from american psycho um right what we're looking for kennedy something kennedy and there's a bank of jamaica scotia bank um [Music] i thought that kennedy building would be on here because that's quite big but um let's pop this here excuse me let's have a look so big old empty lots here these are car parks i think so can we see does it look like there's an airport over here is that an airport tower there might be so maybe the compass is just wrong because there's the airport so could we be around here um that'd be a present so i'm quite really confused because it looks right with that strip along where the airport is i can't find anything else that correlates here um oh no scotiabank here we go bank of jamaica empty kind of lots air jamaica that's what it says okay okay so we're above a car park facing scotiabank so we're probably so one road up so probably on this road above that road i'm determined to get it right out now see i'd say we're right in the middle here come on last round give it to me yes full points not zero yards but i got four points i didn't lose a point on that one lovely right and what was our final score oh but just over twenty thousand so i will take that to the bank this one really yeah but i'm gonna say that's because it was night it was a night shot so that was the problem well let me know how you did in the comments hopefully you guys had a better game got morocco or closer than i did um but that was really fun maybe i will go ahead and [Music] install that code that unity script isn't it and try out the satellite ones it does look fun i'm just very lazy but maybe i'll do that well thank you very much for watching let me know in the comments how you did on this game if you'd like to see some other content and i will

"hello guess what there's another cheer guesser another play along um i found this map on the new list of new maps um english-speaking cities and surrounds sounds you know nice and gentle so i thought we'll play this one and uh see how well we get on so i set this as a challenge i'm not gonna do any times or anything like that let's see what this map is like first um the link will be in the description below if you want to play along uh just to remind you that you don't need to have a paid script prescription a paid subscription to geoguesser to be able to play these links so uh play away right let's start this game okay christian church over there so this looks like america's which one i'm not sure so louisville st louis michigan street ohio street fletcher avenue so i guess we're outside dayton um not sure exactly where that is so let's have a look st louis is in oh there it is okay so dayton um maybe zoom in more so what road are we on do we think on the 70 of the 65 this is 70. and it goes out this way where's 65 there's a 65 here there's louisville which is also on this map sign ah right dayton i can't see it um 17 60 65 here 17 here dayton [Music] um dayton there we go so we're going south east it doesn't really work for the 70 does it unless we're on the 65 does that work no hmm so 65 is here south louisville west lewis i hate these big junctions i never know i don't know how to work them out so excuse me if we have a look can we see junction numbers no that would be too helpful wouldn't it done okay how do we work this out so 70 17 65 michigan street ohio street so 17 now the cat wants to get out at 17 where's the 65 then i know we saw it there it is so are we outside indianapolis or louisville hmm are there 70 isn't here oh these rows are confusing for me maybe if we find some other signs it might help central avenue what does this one say come on zoom down there so 465 east as well four six five four six five why is this taking me so long um there's four six five what are you just around here do you go anywhere else hmm so maybe we are indianapolis so i said we're going south east so maybe we're on the 65. let's have a look here um there were some road names wasn't there some michigan street ohio street maybe we can see these on here um how far out do we think we are where's the junctions with the others here west oak come on i know you're here no i'll probably speed this up you don't want to sit watch me go [Music] and hopefully i'll see in a bit once i found it okay so i found obviously the same sign i managed to find pine street uh not pine street so ohio a mexican but it was east and stuff and i don't know how it works in america but then i found fletcher avenue which is on this sign and then i found exit one one one so i'm just going to go back and see what exit number it was here is there a sign back here so look a bit further a bit further a bit further can we see it's in the trees isn't it maybe a bit further [Music] now okay so let's see what junction this was maybe we'll see it on the map because these rows really confuse me okay so it is just exit one one one and one one two a that's a central avenue so we're heading south so we've got to be further up here uh is there a central avenue was that what this road is called these roads are so confusing to me [Music] nothing like this in the uk the big old rose going through the middle of a city so one one 110a is down there one one one so can we see a couple of roads going off this one is one one three so in between one one three exit only there's one one two a there's one one three then oh so confused i've spent too much time on this let's just put us down somewhere oh here you're going north right so we are on the 65. so we should be on this one however this works i don't understand it's interchangeable right wonderful i'm gonna put us here and let's see what no darn it need big old blooming roads ah all right maybe i need to study the american highway code or whatever you have over there let's try the next one okay this looks fairly british um yellow number plates i think that's england or the uk anyway what does the bin say nothing that i can see cool any other bins no so i think we need to go this way down here so we've got box ridge avenue box ridge avenue goes over both sides of this road salt box give us a council name nope nope looks like there's a bus stop over there what's this box here somebody's washing machine lovely you trinity squared developments 20 squared trinity square i don't know where that is there's a big old crane up there let's see what's down here uh i have to buy 20 squared um no okay let's see what else we can find hill road postbox i'm not gonna be able to see anything on there are we let's skip along here so post boxes have addresses on them usually of the post box itself or the local post office but unfortunately we can't see that so that's no help um this looks like anywhere not useful manholes you any of you can't read anything on there and let's go this way about these for sale signs oh there's some more bins no i can't see anything on those bins ah all right onwards i guess we've got to get to a main road no a lot of buildings going on around here copley is that a place maybe but i don't know where come on ben give us what we need clinical um right thus are either croydon really let's go into croydon curly rise up um hmm so croydon is down here um but this bus could have come from anywhere hollyoaks maybe valley rise period throat um i'm gonna have a look around here for pearly rice you never know might be around here and i will see you in a bit [Music] okay that didn't take too long so here's pearly rise so we were on box ridge avenue with the dead end so let's go back to the beginning um we're outside number 11. so that's the way we went to the end of the road and i guess this is the dead end let's just check here if it passed to pearly right i guess that's that footpath here so we were probably around here that's beginning again turn number 11 [Music] do about one two two maybe four houses in so maybe outside here let's give it a go four yards not bad not bad for not actually counting the houses properly cool right next one that's a very weird name uh what have we got what have we got driving on the left um pacifists what um is this singapore then what else can we see um apple's so crunchy so healthy all right bus what do you say sbs transport so could that signify singapore ah white water right let's have a look at this big sign down here all right can i go this way um kind of maybe if i go back a bit a little bit better right i'm going to go to singapore and let's see down here right so pacifist town maybe i can see that on a quick glance uh tpe so that's pointing to that road to tam tampines town so maybe near here [Music] well at least we're knowing they're in the right place so that's good um and we're going south to get to tampines now what other rows do we have in dr1 farmway 2 3. um i'm probably missing something which i will see while i'm editing but sorry if you're shouting at the screen um come on why can't i see you any other elias road again i might speed this up if it takes me a while i am determined to find this i have passeris drive it was something about in [Music] industrial drive right go back to the beginning serious industrial drive one does that mean that's this road and we're on a different road coming at it from the south uh so it could be one of these roads i guess there's ellie s road pop is here just one second and see so this was water wafer park and then there was white water wasn't there so white water here we go there's white water um buffer substation here we go we must be here on this junction here right yeah probably there right let's see this is going well i'm enjoying this map because it's a lot easier all being in english um right where are we now so we're driving on the right the wrong side of the road um oh wow uh can we skip over here roosevelt way fifth avenue north east where there's no root number um such bad quality as well oh sorry all right give me some other signs and maybe some decent footage that's better what does it say what do you say shut what don't know what you say on the bridge north east 106th street what's this one over here say express lanes north gateway this doesn't help me [Music] what aren't we gonna be something down here um come here to read that either i don't want to go too far on it's taking a while come on just skip down there right shoreline north east no you don't tell me where you are no i went on this massive highway ah do i presume we're in us what's this weird head 523 is it gonna be like around here or something because presidential head or something um another five two two i think that will take us to five two three and is that the five two three it's talking about one place called franklin um there's another place called franklin why um um what are you guys doing do you do you already recognize this area did you see something i missed um don't even know where to begin with this i'm just presuming it's around the capital because it looks like a stately head excuse me um right what are you so restricted lying ahead i guess let's go shoreline so that surely means it could be a river though couldn't it all right let's go back to the beginning and go the other way see if that gives us anything different can i catch that coach doesn't like it um right skippy down here um i'm sure that was a sign maybe it's gone now because it's a different time this footage was taken down here north gateway sound transport transit ride the wave that doesn't help um sorry this is taking me a while i am just absolutely clueless stuck on this highway no idea where we could be um there's that head again right did i just go the same way maybe i did uh idiot um no clues can we get to that bus did we go past the bus and that bus is gone come on this sign i'm just going to plunk it somewhere this side come on this is the one don't say shoreline north seattle college right right over the other side north seattle college so do you think north seattle college is in north seattle so with a saw of it was five two three wasn't it the one with the funny head so five two two here five two four there was shoreline so there's definitely a shoreline here um five three two [Music] um i was hoping there'd be a place called shoreline unless they're on one of these islands uh really not liking this round i presume we've got to be in north seattle right so let's stick with that five two four five two seven five two six five two five five two two where's five two three two six five two five here we go over here somewhere should i be looking for the college all right i'm definitely going to speed this up because you've sat through enough of me going [Music] and i will be back once i found something yeah okay so i finally went back further down to seattle and i saw a shoreline so i then scanned down there until i found roosevelt way roosevelt way and north east 130th street which is here so exit 174 um if i go back to the beginning so that was so we're coming up to it going north so we must be down here somewhere looking at this junction here so i reckon we've got to be around here come on these american roads surely we were down here but oh no i lost a point i lost a point on that i don't agree with that marker placement but it's okay i've already lost some points on this so right last round let's see what we can get with this one um we are probably in new zealand or australia so yup tong avenue or tong let's see if we can get information from these lovely bins um new there are plenty around here so let's look at the next one i can't really read what place that is um some more bins in a moving van let's see right now sign on moving that i don't think this camera's good enough quality to be able to see this is it um nope okay let's get out of the estate then and have a look and so yuktong avenue looks quite big so that should be the good one to look for i guess where did we go um come on look like a school or something twinkle child care center interesting uh english mandarin in german are we in singapore again skills or emmy.asia oh i guess we're in singapore again samsung avenue excuse me okay let's have a look [Music] just behind beauty world mrt station um well mrt station [Music] excuse me where do we start where do we start let's see one of these rows has got mrt on it because that would help nope okay so i am just gonna dive in look around and uh find this place hopefully we're in the right place i will see you in a bit okay i've got myself stuck around this place here because i think this is the station uh because i saw something else say mrt uh i can't see that now i've got myself stuck here and i can't seem to pull myself away i think it's around here but i can't find it um which as we know usually means that it's not around here but i think it is i don't know what to do so i'm going to plonk it because otherwise i can't i can't think of anywhere else or seen anywhere else in singapore that it could be um [Music] that seems pretty silly there are a lot of um daycare centers around here yeah here goes sparkle care sparkle tots i'm sure there was more so i'm going to put it near sparkles maybe they've changed their name maybe they've changed their name who knows i'm going to put it here let's see there's a beauty world center why didn't i see that oh so where's this mrt station then this is beauty world this is bt mtb uh well it serves me right for not really looking around properly yeah darn it oh well oh well not too bad on point so so let's see what the final score is okay okay good about 40 odd points off so i'm happy with that not bad so i thought it was going to be fairly easy i suppose it was fairly easy but um [Music] those american highways really got me it took me quite some time uh let me know how you did in the comments below uh maybe i'll play this one again it's quite fun um and a little bit easier than trying to work out what language it is so it's a nice gentle map um so yeah let me know how you did and i will see you next time bye you ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

"hello welcome back uh another do you guess another play along um i found this one in the uh popular this week list um countries that start with a i seem to like a to z maps at the moment so i thought this might be a fun one maybe fairly easy but we shall see i can only think about three or four countries that start with a so uh let's see what ones we get so set this as a challenge and the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and uh let's see what countries we get all right um looks nice this austria or somewhere else vendor default forfetts i mean that looks like a what'd you call it a thing that goes up a mountain wow uh what else can we find looks like an alpine resort right what's up say hotel crest maybe hotel crest and here is some flags that the spanish flag that's maybe the romanian one not sure but it's okay so there's a bunch of different flags that doesn't help right what else can we see oh no coaches are going to tell us anything uh well that's a patagonia interesting let's see this sign down here will tell us anything so that's kind of french to me um what we got here yeah now i'm very confused so let's see what that's hot says park natural communal see andorra because that's right here yes yes it's got to be right um and where we park natural natural communal hmm um well there's not many roads let's see a quick scan do you think it's more near the french border oh here you go park natural something yes patagonia hotel here we go this must be it uh park information i think that's what we're standing outside of now does it show the little chair lift is that what it is so there's a tunnel which we can see over there um maybe this hotel's just changed names let's pop us here a minute so zoom back out so here's tunnel this goes up here like a big car park tunnel up here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a patagonia zoom back up here so this chair lift thing that says hotel crest but maybe it's just changed names or something or is there another one up here zoom doesn't seem like it all right where did we start exactly here so i just have to presume [Music] that the chairlift isn't on the map and we are on this bit here maybe this esports good store um yeah let's do it let's see let's see [Music] oh a bit further up oh still got 5 000 points so i'll take it nice okay that's good one down many more to go oh very weird view um rolex riches hmm some very cool buildings going on here uh let's see how far this road will take us azerbaijan thank you right uh but where um how can i find it isn't it around here yeah there you go okay so can we presume we're in [Music] the capital um there's some amazing buildings here is that a park it's very dark let's pop down this way maybe see what this building says how far can we go and marry it jw marriott there's avenue on this building um no chance of pronouncing that so i'm gonna have to presume we're here now is the compass going to be correct um [Music] hmm is that a hotel or is that just a shopping thing um so you got some park here maiden tower do you think that's what we can see here you think we're down here somewhere um giant observation wheel can we see that that's pretty impressive building about that building what's that it's like some kind of government building do you think so this is going south west so it could be around here um let's see what we can see that's four seasons supermarket maiden tower that's the 12th century tower right so that's not not that big glass building um right um why do i still feel drawn down here though so maybe further down here sheraton it was marriott wasn't it and that we saw um nothing leaping out might well speed this up but i feel like this is gettable i can just get some bearings i think i mean it's not a city i've visited on the maps um and i feel a bit lost all right i'll speed it up i'll see in a bit okay so i went further down to see what this building was i think it said hilton on it and then the one next door said uh park inn so i think we are around here so there's jw marriott which we saw this looks like it could be this impressive building here um this looks like it's getting set up for the grand prix but unfortunately i don't follow it anymore so i don't know the route exactly but i can only presume we are here um on this junction here i think so i i'm just gonna go for it and let's see oh still with 5 000 points nice don't agree with that but we got it i'm happy not bad not bad let's try the next one seems my computer is going slow again which is wonderful definitely need to get a new one um right where on earth are we now um not really sure and we can't move anywhere can't see that i can't really see what language that is um i don't know ee say park something not sure am i missing something is there something that we can see that will help banco maybe right yes this is gonna test me isn't it so is this a bay [Music] looks like it's just a bay looks like there's some land over there um can the compass be relied upon i mean are we somewhere around here aruba or antigua um [Music] let's have a look at aruba first this has got like a a bay is there a cycle track i think that's the only thing i'm gonna have to go on um i don't know if i can trust the compass [Music] right off aruba antigua um all right i don't know about antiguas and stuff so [Music] okay so it's not here is anywhere else around here let's go to africa angola [Music] along here could be along here because then you'd be looking out you would see that one across here wouldn't you hmm looks like a nice walk is there some kind of park we can spot on here banco put this here a minute there's another banker let's have a look at that building we could see here can't work out what it says so there's a few i wonder if we are here i got no other ideas i think i'm going to go with it i think i am going to go for it right where i put myself here okay let's watch my points drop let's see yes yes i only lost two points that's good where's the banco then what did we see must have been this i guess oh this one here we go bci nice oh oh i think that was very lucky all right nude energy let's uh get into the last couple of rounds right um okay so big old coastal city could we be in argentina i don't know what it looks like from this high up lots of shipping going on okay so c is out to the north ish my first thought is argentina there's a big old city so can i only presume we're here in one azeres and up on some kind of vantage point so here's some uh things thoughts that's the word i'm looking for could we be up there maybe just up here um [Music] pop is here a minute we can move around on this one so might as well so luke oh can we see it does look like a villa oh maybe a monastery or something like that that looks like a fort up there any monasteries or cathedral um what is like higher ground i presume hmm i'm not budging for my thought that it is uh it might not be but it feels like it should be [Music] okay i decided it can't be anywhere else it's got to be around here but i can't find a likely place to put the marker which usually means it's wrong but i can't think where else this could be so i could pop it somewhere um maybe here is that just a monument um i just don't know this is frustrating right but it's somewhere is um i feel like it should be up here somewhere so let's go back up here um and let's put it don't know let's put it and [Music] this is really annoying me i'm sorry guys okay let's put it over here by this museum come on enough mucking about my computer is going slow i was right it was wrong wow there you go fought to santa cruz wow 22 points oh god all right let's get this last round over with obviously not very good at this one um right frozen um where where are we not really sure the language is um parking adapt miramar um and we got oh we got some red there so not eu badges um bins nope okay so we've got the c here and this is proper map so c is to the south pretty much can we see what that sign is seas to the south and there's i thought there was some evidence now i'm not sure is it albania is that on the coast where are you there you are yes um duress there's a season the south so here probably ceremony so what's the name of this sector let's see villa verde villa [Music] third let's see if we can find that [Music] it feels kind of right okay let's see what else can we see [Music] [Music] that way okay oh here you go the rest so to the west which is that way so what's it say port travel agency ferry terminal very terminal is to the west raises to the north west yeah that's going north there's the port this could be one of these roundabouts um i think it actually was on this road i reckon we are actually on this road sorry guys i know this is taking me ages [Music] [Music] oh troy we saw that on the way down i'm sure we did zoom back come on computer stay with me oops holly motorcycles oh there's a street sign we don't know how far that is away from where we are oh we went past that right power that sounds right and then shen mehil so let's find oh there's one of these very isn't it oh here exactly here there's troy okay so how much further until we are where we started i should be counting hotel vivas apartment hotel viva so we're here now right uh that's the one we saw with a bird that i was looking for and that is not on here so luna park is probably that right so else we got down here miramar which we couldn't find either i feel like we get in there um so there's a restaurant okay let's just go back to the beginning now so that's that blue building there's a road there villa coral so look that could be that row that goes around here filler coral here we go so we are pretty much next to that road probably here what side other side i reckon we are probably there come on yes pulled it back on the last round wow well i'm very disappointed myself on that one it was a terrible game uh what did we get okay so we've got over 20 000 so i'll take it i'll take it maybe i'll try the next one the b map yeah i'm not sure how many i can think of let me know how you did in the comments do you want to play the b game as well did you beat me i bet you did why was i set on argentina i'm going for but never mind next time we will do better alright well

everyone back again for another geoguessr another play along this time i found a map called embassies of the world which i thought would be quite fun it says it's easy but we'll be the judge of that um but i presume that most of these locations will be in and around the uh capital of each country that they're in but let's see let's see what this is like so let's start this this is a challenge no other limitations on this one and we'll see what it's like so link will be in the description below if you want to play along let's start okay this looks like the chinese embassy in which country awaiting no parking i can't read that tanglin road so could it be just in hong kong um let's see if we can have a look at this bin bins are great for information [Music] i can't really see anything there which apartment tangling road yes so it could be singapore looking at these buildings might just go into the map and have a look uh where am i going i zoned out for a bit there right let's have a look is there a tangling road so we're looking at the center i guess with these towers and that's in the east so where are the sides sky scrapers and singapore i guess is around here so we should be over here somewhere um let's see let's see if we can find something tangling road um oh didn't mean to do that uh now i hope again i don't see something when i come to edit it like i do every time it was like it was right there um commonwealth towers maybe that's what we can see we've got high commissioner malaysia here and usually they're in the same place embassies singapore indonesia singapore um but this chinese wonder seem to be quite a big building um no road names okay here we go no i feel like it's here somewhere but i'm just being blind um i might speed this up if it takes me a while which is possible um let's see nothing here nothing here [Music] i am definitely missing something i think ah tangling road here we go uh let's see and pursue my animal it's here a minute did this have a number on it i think it did didn't it 150 tanglin wrote so how long is tanglin road oh right here we go yes okay here let's just check right in front maybe off to the side a little go the five yards good good start let's go next one right swiss embassy it's like a european number but maybe they put that there to fill it home um can't really make out the language on that um let's have a look around what we got here eu badges on the cars by the looks of it um [Music] kind of reminds me of like check writing i could be completely off there mmm i don't know what that says good start me let's see what this road sign has to say you you say um don't know not sure not sure okay so we have a big sign up here let's see what this says right kanye i do not know where that is do not know where that is okay so we still got eu badges so we're definitely an eu country uh what does this say simon le parque so i feel like i've seen this language but i cannot think oh what it is quite hilly and do we go up do we go down oh so there's the center ballot to it which is to the north west north north west just a pop down here let's see if we get anything else there's an eu flag what are you i think this is probably the same building isn't it i don't know ah that's vaccius ah yes aha i got a flag right maybe i should do a flag map right so let's have a look what does this look like of course quite a big place quite a big place have limane airport why can i just not think not really sure what country this is okay so it kind of reminds me a bit of turkish language as well um now of course there could be eu cars there because you know they're close to you are they in the eu i don't think so i know um okay okay okay okay so i've frozen hotel or something where'd it go hello i'm completely confused let's go i don't i want to go down there i want to go up back up here no no yeah we're here oh ah so are we in turkey that's okay let's go with it let's go with it so we said it was to the north so north don't know what the road is called um so this must be the center it's down here somewhere and there's a british embassy some other resident oh that's a university or something um oh come on just jump out of me be nice and easy am i gonna know need to know what switzerland is in turkish to pinpoint this because i have no idea so it's a french um we also saw the slovakian one didn't we so there's the u.s embassy did we see abd up here um back all right there's turkey okay okay we're definitely here then so q and b not abg let me just work out where this tunnel is so this tunnel is going north pretty much can we find this tunnel i don't know what that is going on there um come on me we can do this we can do this i feel like it's on this road maybe this is the tunnel here um put me down here this is just some kind of weird junctions going on here it goes underneath like that um i can't see anything else that we saw um and then could it be this road here oh there's park the park right so further up here there was a park which was called uh it was called say mendler say menlo not that one right okay i will probably speed this up i'm gonna find this park somewhere down here um and hopefully the thing yep oh wait here's a slovakia one there's a bus stop maybe it's this one okay so maybe you don't need to speed it up this is the park entrance so there's ah i'm getting too excited let's see so this splits off here right so this splits off and goes into the park um then there's a road here i've got it's got to be here it's got to be this one right what was this road name again farabi um [Music] does any of that correlate there's a romanian embassy oh here this is that road for abby okay so could we be further up can i see that um probably not yeah so that's that road definitely okay this is that road so let's go back to the beginning so that road was there there's no other road oh yes is this one teak hmm that row just isn't on here techyon now there's another row set of row times here ah there we go yes this has got to be it so we started outside so it's right opposite that road it's got to be here oh come on sorry that took me a while one yard are you guys getting on this is easier than i thought but i'd like to be a lot quicker pinpointing these things so i can't really tell that flag like that and not being good at flags embassy to cuba okay so that's that so there's the cuban embassy in somewhere somewhere um let me see dollar republic at the cuba um where are we though uh bins maybe these bins will help good old communal bins nothing on there nothing nothing right jump down the other way look at this mcdonald's have that it's in dollars combos del dia so latin america maybe [Music] um oh dot signs no um communa 13 doesn't mean much to me do we have any urls on these adverts and they're gone of course of course i wish i was better at language oh yes this a r now was that argentina did we work out last time should i remember these things absolutely okay let's have a look got to be so would it be buenos aires um and what did we see here communa 13 do we have those kind of references on here well there's a lot of roads there is a lot of roads um okay so you'd think 13 would be fairly central um is there an area called communal can you pull out a bit um avenue 27 [Music] okay around it here so does that mean it's within this area i guess i don't think i've ever really had this city come up before okay so open it let's see um so can we see any signs of cities are we right in the middle there is some high rises around here [Music] yeah i'm gonna stick here i've got some road signs here this road is going north east watch me fail on my compass directions south west north east north east south west that way like that right so like this road here for instance okay i'm definitely going to speed this up i'm going to have a wand around and see if i can find this road or um stumble upon the embassy not sure how easy that will be i'll see you in a bit oh that took a ridiculous amount of time but i persevered somehow um and i found the embassy to cuba amazingly i found a sign further down the road that said rotary club um belgrano belgrano and i found this area and lo and behold here is the embassy so where did we start exactly uh just on the corner of this road and this road i believe so probably here um let's just double check these road names so i re been us yeah so yeah i think probably here let's have a look and two yards okay that was worth the i don't know 20 minutes or whatever it took me oh lord how are you guys getting on on this one i mean two more rounds to go and i hope it doesn't take me this long i hope you have not had such a long game either one day i'll be better straight in there pinpoint it yes i know not yet though right where are we now so this is um okay i'm not sure what flag that is right now do we have a hint on the outside um no um right okay what else we got here is that say embassy de la i can never pronounce that but uh ivory coast i think that is okay so what country are we actually in i mean this is looking european french right right yes i don't know this looks italian badges let's pop down the road here [Music] um [Music] watch real estate um dot fr okay france right huh go down here i mean it is feeling all very french to me we've got here avenue raymond pond care not sure but are we in paris so luke um [Music] i don't know [Music] [Music] bearings somehow does this say a museum or something there we go so probably in paris musee to enery and avenue something maybe the museum might be easier to spot um no other big sites that we can see from here museum to enery so luke that's quite big in a lot of museums uh enery i guess we start somewhere um start up here shall we again i'll probably speed this up because that other one took me a long time and i don't want it to be a massively long video so i'll speed this up looking for museo de enerie [Music] okay well that took me a while so i found um another sign that said 16th or apr and i or ar or so as you can see these districts i guess their districts so i found that district and finally found avenue for um and um embassy cod de ivoire um so where do we start right at the entrance just by this road which i'm not sure i can read that this one not a gallery um yeah probably that one so i would guess here here and it's not a gallery that building i presume and this is the embassy let's see let's just go for it three yards there's some good yardage in this game all right well it took me a blooming long while but i don't know there's only one round there's oh no okay come on perfect score is in sight though so i should keep that in mind don't head back the microphone come on camera's running out battery so this is a photosphere so i can't move anywhere so this is the embassy of yemen in oh oh no says tell me anything [Music] am i already tired and done with this map um i can only guess we are in the middle east somewhere i can't move anywhere else can't see anything else above me it's like it's a covert camera um city of something there's a fair amount of english here um okay so yemen is here right yes the fair amount of english so could we be in uae my computer is tired as well look let's put it there a minute um embassy of yemen i presume that is how it's written in yemen look probably oh come on computer don't take this down so close to the end come on right um i'm gonna go with um goodbye so i'm tired you're tired the computer looks to be tired because it's not loading anything so let's just get this ended shall we um oh come on please why are you being so slow [Music] okay okay okay so where would embassies be do we think there's a university probably too far out that's industrial city um industrial area probably not international city phase two sounds good sewage work probably not near a sewage works i thought design district business bay would they be business so like a government quarter um trade center i can't see any other embassy things financial center um [Music] no i'm probably in the wrong country anyway general residency oh consulate general of ghana so if it's here this could be it could be the area sri lanka malaysia um are we not gonna find pakistan india saudi arabia chamber of commerce british is that just a museum yes um state saudi libya lebanon sudan by iraq jordan where's yemen uh did buy india customers happiness center nice oh come on must be here somewhere am i just not seeing it hey okay i really have to hurry this up before the battery runs out right um uh uh okay okay come on come on come on make a decision i feel like it should be around this area if we're even in the right place let's zoom in a little bit more yemen here we go right i'm going to pop it here maybe somehow okay not too far away we're in riyadh all right okay okay close but not close enough damn it all right let's have a look oh well not too bad it was a lot easier than i thought although i spent a long time a long time on some of those rounds how did you guys do hopefully you've beaten me and you've done it quicker and you had a much more fun time but i enjoyed it still so maybe try a no moving for this one again i think might be quite fun let me know what you think in the comments below and i will see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 1.302852569900576, "lng": 103.8208546371363}, {"round": 2, "lat": 39.89753477705777, "lng": 32.86154477743217},

"hello welcome back another geo guest for another play along um i thought i'd do another borders i just did a us board as one i'll probably put that one out before this one um which is pretty good fairly easy so i thought i'll try this one next which is borders of the world which should be harder a little more interesting i don't know definitely harder i reckon so uh let's just get into it when the ambulance goes past right so this is a challenge the link will be in the description below if you want to play along so uh let's see what borders we get all right um looks like french and what else can we get here official coverage presidency hmm not sure see we can only go this way argentina maybe argentina hmm so i've gone completely blank on this one right so there's quite a massive border up there can we go can't go over there and you go this way let's have a quick look see what else there is to see [Music] um don't know there's a big river [Music] and we're going south at the moment don't know there'll be anything else that i could recognize um it's a nice big road bending round okay i'm not sure i'm going to get anything else down here sure what's going on down there that's interesting let's just go back to the beginning okay so probably argentina let's just get into the map [Music] so that way argentina or so that road going that way is to south west i mean it could be it's quite a big border around here i don't know the name of the town [Music] um right good wonderful oh this is not gonna be easy okay come on we can do this uh puentel metallico do you think that's a place let's have a look um i think it's an area maybe otherwise i'm not really sure what to work out in our directions which we all know is not not great um it doesn't look mountainous so i think i can probably rule out border with chile yeah i think we can rule out most of that chili border um so maybe along here let's put this here a minute okay let's work this out properly i don't know which way is argentina which way is whatever other country it is so it looks like she's going north this looks like it's the border so i can only presume we're in [Music] argentina so going north east so it could be around here so i'll probably speed this up i'm going to have a look um around this border and look for anything [Music] this one here six messes don't know what that means maybe that's he's got numbers yes i'll speed this up hopefully i'll find something otherwise i'll plunk it see you in a minute [Music] okay so i found this row 11. the direction isn't quite right but it's got 11 on here number 11 maybe that says national route number 11. there's a river here which is correlates with this one down here and another row going alongside so i think we are here not quite here but i think we're around here maybe um there's another road there i don't know if it goes across there i think we're here so let's let's see let's see oh all right oh i'm proud of myself for that one that is good right something as easy please [Music] what is going on um what is this all right uh can we see over here um what do i go on with this one guys i mean i i don't even know what to say i can't move i can see this bridge um [Music] i don't really know any meta so there's nothing i can get from that i mean it's unofficial coverage anyway so i don't even know if i can rely on the compass it's a very big river it says hudson ch so servios um [Music] i don't know if it's the hudson in america i don't think so um right completely lost so could be anywhere big rivers thinking amazon um [Music] that's in ch could that be anything to do with chile again i mean there's a big thing here but big thank you big bit of water um right um [Music] i do not know this is another big river there's a bridge a road over it oh looks like that goes under it no it's a boat crossing right not that one um where do i go what do we think completely lost on this one all right do we presume the compass is correct there's no sun to go by so that's not going to help um such a big such big river hmm um i mean there's some big lakes it could be like it looks more like a river there isn't it hmm i am completely stuck with this i don't know just don't know i still have feeling it's here where on the border here here's some borders but there's no road or bridges but let's just follow this shall we um [Music] and then the border goes here's another one look like there's any roads going over it very wiggly it seems like it's probably in the mountains uh no i'm going to have a look around a bit more probably speed this up because i'm going to be human rn for a lot so i'll see you in a minute [Music] okay i can't find any bridges along any of these borders um i just feel like it's around here so i am going to plonk it i'm gonna plunk it here don't know why let's see let's have a look it's a much smaller river it looks so much bigger than that wow there it is right well lisa's in the right continent but wow it's very far right very far away really never mind next one is going to be good next one is going to be the one what but this is a is this another river this is gonna be another river oh wow what am i going to go by that's just beach it says nothing [Music] landmark wise to pinpoint this um right okay let's pretend like the compass is correct so we're on a river that goes more south but i just don't know where where are you happy people from ah don't know don't know ah um i think america's again but i don't know [Music] i don't know where whether it goes north south gosh this is such a hard map um completely clueless don't know at all so anything that you would have known that you could pinpoint a location using i mean i don't can't see anything [Music] um there any beaches here that's basically what we're looking for isn't it beachy um i'm back here again right i don't think i'm gonna spend too much time [Music] on this one it's gonna annoy me i think um anything along here and now every piece up see anything there um what about here no no no no no right i'm gonna plunk it i'm gonna plunk it somewhere maybe here why do i think here there's not a lot going on there well there is some stuff going on here look there's some beaches here all right plonking it here let's see oh my god really that's amazing but okay and on the right side of the border wonderful okay i should trust myself a bit more that's amazing okay we can do this now definitely definitely oh come on oh that's just somebody on a kayak [Music] i don't like this map i mean i've got an amazing guest so that's cool but um i don't know now this is nuts um well you got any information on you nope yeah that's cool [Music] i like that anyway right so um [Music] what the hell i mean are we on the same river again [Music] not the same river but are we in south america or could we be in maybe somewhere in africa i don't know it could be drc or something oh that's quite a lot okay do i just want to guess in africa because it'll be somewhere different i've got my amazing guest now so does it matter yes it does yes it does right um this is going this way again isn't it um this looks too wide well hmm no i don't think so uh where else where else without some interesting borders i don't know that it's those but that would be quite fun um no no hmm sandy no no right next ah come on it's on like a sand bar really it's got a lot of bits i don't really know much about these places like what color the ground would be [Music] i'm liking it though for some reason oh victoria falls um and this looks like it's probably in a in a mountain dip if that makes any sense [Music] a little bit hilly can't really see any towns or anything um but i mean he's got to they've got to collect from somewhere i like this i like this area let's see let's put us let's put us on this one yeah let's do it let's do it another amazing guess okay not too bad again right continent so good where were we here between angola and namibia so other side but how far let's zoom out okay all right not too bad not too chubby let's see what happens on the last round okay well this is a bit easier um we entering or leaving switzerland so this is swiss side and that's going to germany by looks of it then a river so right quite a little border here um let's see does this see if we can see this sign a bit better no nope no no nice big bridge where are you going to you're going along a bridge of a river through a mountain um come on i just want to see that sign well let's see it's like a bridge doesn't it bridge maybe a river i'll sit down here um no yep definitely a bridge going west see what sit down here a little roundabout so it's going over bridge probably ryan um number seven here's number seven there's bad whatever that was betzer zuzak um are we on this border though ah so that said sold something else didn't it so goblins to the north so i'm going to travel down the river travel down the river and see if we can find this one awesome so cold blends pop us there give us the point yes oh well that was an up and down map wasn't it how did we do after all 18064 okay well that one was painful but i'm so glad we're in the right kind of area and the same for the africa one as well i mean [Music] it makes me feel like i'm getting better which is amazing um but let us know how you did in the comments below what could have picked up on some of those to know where i was that will be really handy if you can let me know thank you for watching and i'll see you next time ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -25.26528010364286, "lng": -57.72819300525745}, {"round": 2, "lat": 3.8569942, "lng": -51.82565229999999}, {"round": 3, "lat": -32.4388726,

"hello welcome back another geogra another play along um decided i'm going to do lots of filming today for some reason so i'm not sure when all of these will come out um so happy weekend happy week whatever uh i came across this map a divisional united states state borders it's easy i thought it sounded interesting considering i don't know a lot about the state so that might help get some more knowledge on uh where the states are and things may be helpful in that way let's see so let's get into this map i said it as a challenge i'm not going to put any should i no i'm not gonna put anything on it maybe if it's too easy or i play it again i might do a no moving maybe we'll see we'll see what it's like right link will be in the description below if you want to play along and uh let's try it all right very pretty um where do i get a feel [Music] probably like new england way maybe i'm not massively confident let's zoom down here and see what we can see charlestown wall pole uh keane now is that a picture of a state do we think hmm um paul charlestown none of that rings any bells for me i don't know if that does for you guys maybe let me know in the comments um so where do we go see if i can see one that looks the same um so i thought it was up here but i don't think any of these state borders match up um really so i might have to look around a bit more to find something [Music] no i see charlestown a quick look around i think i'm gonna see charlestown like this am i it's a bit like that but the wrong way around no um okay washington [Music] doesn't quite do this should be flat so maybe oregon it's got a wiggly bit here okay i think this is not getting me anywhere uh all right let's look around a bit more um one two three and twelve is that road which way shall i go south number 12. um let's say what state we're going to or from [Music] the north one two three that looks like a uh they call it interstate road so it's quite small i think a quick look over this side of the bridge quicker oops missed some signs there oopsie westminster i don't think it's london township number one that means state law handheld electronic devices prohibited alpha drivers no mobile phones um westminster so that still makes me think like new england area um sorry guys it's taken me a lot longer than i thought so i'm gonna have a look at some more signs down here then go back to the map and see vermont right i want this up here right is it ah i know nothing about stage time nothing at all right i am going to have a look around on the map i'll probably speed it up look for those routes one two three um five look for vermont um and see i'll see you in a bit okay didn't take me that long so here's westminster i zoomed in a bit and saw the five and then i've now found westminster so is it this bridge here was there a minute let's see another bridge there fellow falls i don't think because it says we're coming into westminster which is here so i think we're going new hampshire into the month so vermont is a state i did not realize so vermont is this still that goes up here like that i guess a little slither and then this is the other one let's zoom out a bit more so vermont and new hampshire okay well now i know whether it will stick in my head or not no idea let's see if this is right first yes okay good lovely good good next one did you guys know that vermont was just you laughing at me all right let's see entering pelham okay some big industrial stuff going on here is it cement work maybe um right so i think the best signs look like they are down here so let's have a look pelham new hampshire we were just there welcome to new hampshire live free or die okay a bit scary um right threatening new hampshire again what was the name of the town again i can't remember the pelham wasn't it [Music] hello so which way are we going we are going north so probably this border where's new hampshire again stops here let me put my marker there so i know we look from here that way right so pelham uh [Music] probably be good if i got a root number wouldn't it there's pelham okay maybe not them right what road are we on so we're going pretty north do you think it's this road i don't think it's that road i don't think it's that road this one have like a yeah pj keating and co there we go so on this border here see oh this is a nice gentle easy map until it all goes wrong ah right mason dixon line awkward pennsylvania pursue your happiness uh welcome center that's nice not a threatening motto um so pennsylvania coming north ish p a e back over here again so do we think we're on this border where are we coming from um mason dixon line mason dixon that river name because this is pennsylvania right yeah that's a delaware delaware is also a state so that's helpful uh that's another river but it's not dixon or anything like that um so i don't know what that is referring to um no no idea so i think do we see what the other side of the road tells us where we're entering into washington county that's county not state right pennsylvania it's west virginia virginia um washington county so could that be this area here hmm possibly right pop is there a minute still need to know where on this county line we are so let's try and find a road number something like that um franklin county antrim township right i think there's a place called antrim ancient township though i don't know what that means it'll be on this side so i'll have a look around i might well speed it up um and let's see if we can work out what road we're on i might have a look at some more signs in a bit as well [Music] okay um i think i've plonked my mark in the right place because it says green castle next two exits and green castle is here so yeah plunking on the right place are there still two roads here state line um rv center i saw that i swear right let's go back getting over excited what's what do we got here i saw rv place here keys keystone arby's yes this is it this is it here come on i might do well in an america round still two more rounds to go though so what the heck what is that i must be um a wind turbine [Music] wing propeller i should know because i work for a company that built them i can't remember their names right here we go interstate 25 pyro city sounds a bit dangerous all pyromaniacs oh what is this coverage oh my god oh my god look back over here ah wyoming right up here here okay i was close-ish close-ish so interstate number was back back ah where is it as that says welcome to colorado cool where's that interstate number i know what let's go back 25. 25 is that colorado yes yes yes yes here terry bison ranch resort wyoming sign yes yes yes yes what huh i thought i remember that driving on the different side of the road still i'll take it last round come on perfect score would be lovely stateline road good name illinois state line illinois um do you think over here it will say what state we're coming from wisconsin wisconsin illinois wisconsin here so along this line somewhere there a minute and there was a number [Music] there's one here 120. oh 120. is there a state line road a nice state line uh come on it's gotta be or something's gone very wrong just put it further down but yes perfect score lovely okay very happy with that just double check yes okay so i think i've got a few of the states definitely got a long way to go maybe i'll do a sparkle maybe i'll do a sparkle on this that should be funny because i still don't think i have any idea but uh i'm happy an american map perfect score i will take that to the bank how did you guys do let me know in the comments below and i will see you in the next one which i'll probably record in a minute bye ",

we'll see what happens so wishes all luck um i'll make this a challenge the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and um let's start this game oh this is nice wow look at that okay where are we we are somewhere english speaking i guess um or not that reminds me of portuguese amazing looking place cabana a manu didn't that say something like that emmanuel hmm could we be in [Music] brazil maybe let's see if this gives us anything this little sign here now it's blurred out perfect um okay let's go back let's have a look down here anything here more cabanas um this sign hmm a lot of lodgings i guess maybe for people going up this mountain it's amazing place look at that what else we got down here what's this big green thing uh water and it looks so empty though doesn't it uh let's see this gives us anything so puerto ibanez um [Music] that stool i still think it's portuguese or is that spanish oh can't go any further that way i might have a look at the map already like i said i don't want to make it too long like my last video let's have a look um big mountains and a port oh look at the compass so this port is south east do you think that goes out to the sea there maybe so south east so around here maybe this side it then is okay i might speed this up i'm going to have a look for puerto ibanez and i might just start right down here and see if i can find anything okay well that didn't take too long which is good i found this place puerto in general ibanez and i zoomed in and we have cabanas emmanuel so i think this is the place but let's correlate this so we've got a residential manuel restaurant and then i think it was somewhere else around here that's another restaurant so let's have a look uh is that the one we saw just now hmm [Music] let's check the road direction so this is going [Music] kind of southeast ish which kind of is northwest and this one is going north east do we think there's mountains here you can't really tell oh yeah yes very mountainous so i think we are probably here um do i think we're on this junction let's double check so one two two down from the c yeah i think we're here um and probably here all right let's see oh cool good good start right let's make it the same for the next one [Music] hmm so the big city over there i guess we just run down the road here and see where we're heading to oh okay um i got in the back of my head i recognize these names but i can't thinking indonesia but i'm not sure why um let's have a quick look it reminds me these kind of names um see if we can find any of those so i know i'm in the right area which i very much doubt i don't have much faith in myself um are we on one of the other islands and i'm just hoping it's going to jump out at me but that's not always the case is it um hmm let me have a look at the next sign and see what those say and then over here hmm right i still think we're around here somewhere so i'm going to speed this up again and i'm going to have a look for some of these places i will find it okay so i found this sign and this says malaysia so because i was thinking the other side said klcc and i thought that sounds a bit like kuala lumpur maybe and where's that i found another sign that looked like the towers um [Music] here maybe those are the towers or something um so i think we're in kuala lumpur but i cannot pinpoint where we are so m-r-r-one is that a road name oh hello gin con [Music] i saw those oh my god this is such a big place so klcc park maybe that's where it's pointing to over to the east so we must be on one of these big roads um now we saw something about gin parliament [Music] now that's this road here oh um twin razak here [Music] um oh come on we're so close i feel it so this is chun rezak still sultan is good [Music] there's that pali men one so this is still gin how long do i want to spend mucking about a while hmm so maybe this one road could it be this weird junction here there is a lot of things going on what was this sign over here so that's the road jalan parliament and that's kuching did we see that now this is cooching uh [Music] around here somewhere i can feel it i just don't know where okay okay okay we can do this we can do this um let's go back up here and no i want to go all right let's go back to the beginning okay so we're on an overpass city's over there those are the towers right over to the north so i think we might be a bit further down here um maybe around here there's a botanical gardens right right right right i'm gonna go for somewhere in this mess here um yes i'm gonna go here let's see let us see oh oh not bad not bad i'm happy with that still only round two though come right we can get through this quickly and get some good oh no okay we've got some c that's good c is to the west see i'm not sure that's russian or not this is not going to be easy right now the sea is to the west um yeah that looks ration doesn't it not greek uh [Music] c is to the west hmm it should be over here maybe it's kazakhstan [Music] okay could be um [Music] it's like a pinch point of land here um that would be going out to the that would be going out to the west wouldn't it i'm going to put my marker here a minute there's no bridge going over that is there no okay so that's a possibility where else is a possibility so if it was um this area maybe could be here i think that's too much going on for it to be there here not sure about that i don't think it's that and i think it's that i don't think it's around here um [Music] i don't think it's there could it be no oh we've got some number plates here look there's no eu badges they're all very old  cars uh okay i'm going back over this way uh so that's a possibility we got over here no don't think it's around here [Music] um here and there's some petersburg it doesn't feel like it all right i'm going to make itself a decision i think it's around here although it doesn't look like it's much of a town does it um but hmm how about this one [Music] i'm gonna go there i'm not gonna spend too much time on this one probably gonna feel very stupid maybe i should just look around a bit more look around a bit more okay just in case i miss something very obvious it's going to be quite upsetting isn't it um that's we got up here a little sharp yeah i don't know i don't know what else i could get i'm not sure i've gone north enough on the map go um okay i'm gonna stick with where i am it's mountainous right isn't it is it not okay i gotta stick with it make decision made let's see how far off it was russia oh i had a quick look here but oh yeah look at that 66 points ah never mind never mind one day i'll get a rush around that's perfect right so we're in korea um [Music] on the mountain i guess big kill right how do we work out where we are in korea do we go down do we go up um it's not very good pictures isn't it um i'm gonna go down down down down we cool main road lovely right school zone um hmm there's a sign lovely right what we got here han dang city hall yongsan roll mockpow station i guess so that's what i'm looking for let's have luke hang so much going on here as well isn't there how far do i need to be zoomed in for this one so look for yong san as well as hadang um and hopefully i'll find something i will speed this up be back okay i found somewhere called mock pole and there's mockpow station on here i haven't found the other two names but maybe that's an area of this place so let's have a look um young san jung where's the station there's a train line i guess that's the station maybe um anything else if i zoom out okay i think we're here papa's here a minute let's go back to the beginning now there was a street name somewhere here i can't really see that though over this way maybe [Music] of course it's blurred out wow wonderful um can't go any further that way so let's see if we can catch this road name there we go right and this road is going south east-ish sunday sunday um let's have a look this is the center back out it's kind of to the east uh so maybe up here somewhere looks like a big tunnel maybe up here i'm not gonna see their own names now am i oh there's a school we're in a school zone so i just maybe go where i started i know this isn't the road name but oh my lights just died so what happens when you take too long um well this is yongdang maybe that's where that road is pointing to so okay oh it's been too long come on was it sand wasn't it sunday i can feel it's close just like the other one maybe i don't think we're this far up were we no no no um over here a bit further up the hill ending up in the same area sandong [Music] sunday um okay okay okay okay what's this road yeah i'm gonna go silence i'm gonna stay where i am now where i first clicked let's just go for it come on bit further down a bit further down there we go sunday ah still not mad at myself for that close to perfect score on that one last round awesome um right i don't know if you'll get any english here at all um this is gonna have to be a wild gas it's got some hills up there to the north ish and this is going uphill as well let's get to higher ground looking out for signs on the way um no it's like an official building though doesn't it um pop up here a bit further all right what's this like an old fort or something um i'm not sure we're going to see that something center um [Music] and there's a mosque bus come back bus maybe you can give me some information nope um all right what do i do restaurant i don't even have a feeling for where this could be um oh flags my downfall pretty tatty flags i'm going to forgive myself for not being able to see those okay oh why is the last round always so terrible let's see if we can go this way a touch and see this it's gone ben's nothing on it you yep hermes logistic group but where are you delivering to uh [Music] i just don't know i get no feeling [Music] it's obviously somewhere i've not been to on the maps before [Music] um [Music] no badges i can see that's helpful um carrick maybe that says but so no right i'm not sure i'm going to get anything else that will help me my very limited knowledge of the world so plonk and guess i guess i'm not sure it's pakistan um maybe it's yemen uh in all of these places we've got nice ancient buildings and castles um so plunkett i think i'm gonna plonk it in iran it's kind of in this rack here let's see okay not so bad not so bad so we were in jordan didn't even think of that area at all okay i'm not too mad at that what did we get in the end that's bad i blame russia all right one day i'm gonna get a good score one day i'm gonna get a perfect score on this map is all about the rounds i swear if you're lucky enough to get some good rounds it's a good map but times like this disappointment disappointment and misery let me know how you did in the comments below and i will see you next time for hopefully a better school ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -46.29357798946431, "lng": -71.9368718599033}, {"round": 2, "lat": 3.146165626483062, "lng": 101.67935009812277}, {"round":

"hello welcome back uh i thought it was time to try i saw the sign again um and see if i can get a better score than i did before i think i've got 22 last time i filmed it so i've got a better score on here um i think before i started filming let's see if we can beat this school or get a perfect score maybe who knows um so let's give it a try so let's make it a challenge the link will be in the description below if you want to play along and uh let's see if i can do any better maybe hopefully right um okay lebanon rv center sorry if you can hear those sirens i presume this is in america and not lebanon um so what else can we see just to confirm not that i know where that would be in america if it is um can we see an american flag anywhere no s top street yep top street about this church usually they have some good information on them and it is unity church um no other information okay you need to see church no no flags either very strange let's just pop down here be nice if we could see what side of the road people are driving on because then that will confirm it for me um gulf street because it looks quite warm [Music] so am i in the wrong head hemisphere uh let's see what does this say concealed driveway yeah we are driving on the right as long as there's cars on the right side of the road yes um bins sometimes have some good information city of lebanon okay that's well that confirms that but still not sure what um state oh is that a um stadium city of lebanon parks um about state there small signs down here the rock tabernacle what does it mean is this not church um a few more signs then i'm gonna have to have a look at the map see what i can find um sometimes these cars have things no okay okay okay not okay right let's go back to the beginning um [Music] don't know there's anything [Music] here that i missed uh just going sideways there that's good okay let's have a look at the map so i guess so i think itself because it looks warm [Music] i don't know that's anything to go on i'm not sure if city means it's big what a uk person would think would be big um where do i start just hoping it's gonna leap out at me but i don't know that's going to be the case and i would like to get perfect score so i have a feeling i've seen lebanon somewhere but i've scanned this map so many times now i can't think where it was um ah yeah missouri oh that was lucky okay so are we gonna be lucky enough that the rv place is noted or am i gonna have to find out what is the name of the road now i can't remember and hopefully this is the right lebanon um it looks a bit bigger than this place but maybe we're just on the outskirts i can't remember the name of the church that's a different church i think um okay let's have a look up here nope okay i might speed this up especially if the other rounds take me longer as well um i'm going to have a look at street signs because i can't remember the road names and some other points of interest maybe the church name let's see if i can find that one here and um ready to pinpoint where we are i'll see you in a minute if i speed it up which i'm sure i will right i looked around a bit more i saw a sign for the us route 231 uh which made me think it wasn't in the lebanon that i was looking at which was back up here somewhere where was it let's zoom out a bit it was around here there missouri found the 231 down here and followed it all the way up until i finally came to this lebanon here and i found the rv center so let's go back here right outside it um [Music] on that road so yeah i think we're about there okay good today i'm determined for this perfect score that took me a long time i'm hoping the rest won't take me as long how did you go do you know that lebanon did you go to the wrong one like me uh oh no this doesn't look good ah united card let's have a look at the sign we were looking at when we arrived hugh hughinden center tire center well i can't even read now i really did be in that last one um okay yamaha motorcycles petrol station i guess um all right there's a nice sign looks like this should be a nice sign here see what it says porcupine gorge so i think we are in the southern hemisphere see the sun is uh nicely in the west so that doesn't help um sure this ariel here means something to somebody not to me um porcupine gorge national park so it looks like we're driving on the left that sign is on the left um do i think this is australia maybe hmm which way do i go to look for stuff um that looks like a big road over there somewhere maybe excuse me um some street signs here can't really read those can we go in here just some here's to the east there um it'll be that way that you might tell you're gonna give us something foxtel [Music] meals camping don't know caravan park um right maybe this sign a bit further is that a flag look uh i don't know what that says what do you say what flag did you have just now why is it blurred out no no why oh that's let's street okay good can i get a look at this sign ah the sun's on it yeah just parking oh come on okay so here in den ambulance station so heunden is the name of the town i guess um just need to confirm what country we're in here i'm still thinking australia um i mean it's possible it's south africa no there won't be as much english with there ah so to see some bins there to help but that didn't come okay so it's definitely hue and hue and hue and in somewhere hmm where else am i going to get some information here um probably not down the rest of this road nope um don't look like a big place so i don't typically want to spend too much time scouring the map for it porcupine gorge or something let me zoom up down here see if there is anything it's this big sign here um sun mood at all probably not looks like it's in the south oh i don't know um i could be able to see that are we right make a decision choose somewhere uh definitely driving on the left i want to get a perfect score on this map so i am going to have to persevere i'm going to go into australia um and try and find this place um hughenden right let's go back to the beginning hue and entire center and what was the name of the national thing porcupine gorge in humandon i'm sure i'm going to speed this up as well so i'll see you in a minute wish me luck okay so luckily on a scan this zoomed out i've managed to find humandon and just up here porcupine so where are we on this map there's an airport okay i guess we're in the middle um i can't look for now it's a tire place wasn't it um there's another rv place oh yeah there was a camping place wasn't there let's plunk us here a minute go back to the beginning so tire dealer um motorcycle dealer this road is going east this was a united card garage so we're going this way here we go hue and entire and motorcycles so are we on this road seeing this is a road so maybe here oh come on give me the full points please amazing amazing right we can do this yes come on i hope you guys are doing well as well probably a lot quicker than me on this one right centro clinico hospital del diamacas okay does that say i don't know what that says uh don't know something c i don't know let's see what else we can find um a lot of gas on this street um so what do you think central clinical iess gob dot dc uh there's a 9-1-1 but i guess most of the americans use that number by the books of it so i don't know what that says dear maccast do you think that's the name of the town all right let's have a look around it's for the hospital as well um and here view hotels or anything [Music] um that's just can't go up there perfect a wonderful ah maybe perfect score slipping through my fingers um [Music] no oh come on give me something i don't know what that says hold on do we have no not holy uh no holes in the oh what'd you call these things pylons powered sticks uh so i think that means we can rule out mexico um um [Music] where's the sun sun sun sun the north west i don't think we can use the sun or am i reading it wrong let me know in the comments because that would be quite useful um ah i am absolutely lost here guys some beautiful mountains but i don't know what mountains they are um i'm hoping this would be a sign here that we can read just more things about trucks all right gonna go a bit further down and hope for something something something um is that a river that's lovely um right sorry cevende and tereno there don't know don't know i think i'm done for i think i am completely done for on this one unless i've just missed something big or there is just some information i do not know um it's a mountains river where's the sun again i don't think that's going to give me anything is it let's go back to the beginning have a quick look down here pepsi sign i think oh does that mean they they do have meters on the outside um what else is there oh there's some signs let's see homes uh that's spanish or portuguese i don't know ah terrible not lovely anything else around here this bit seems a bit busier maybe maybe this has a web address dot com ah why ah casas it sounds spanish that's nothing to go on okay can't really see that la algeria and morona radio this gives us a web address well they use dollars i don't know it doesn't mean anything to me either carol tv now i seen a satellite with that one before i can't remember where that was okay back to the beginning got to plunk it somewhere i don't think i'm going to get information that i can dissect i still don't still don't know hmm [Music] i don't know bc dc where would that be um sorry guys it's going to let you down not going to get a perfect score means you can beat me though so be happy about that um where am i going to put this in am i going to put this i'm going to put this in i'm going to go columbia um probably completely wrong i'm stalling because i'm not sure if i want to give up this perfect school but i don't know what else to go on uh so i think i have to i think i have to this is a nice looking river and there's some mountains next to it so you know maybe it's gonna be a crazy guess um probably not that's got a dell in it that's that plonk it here not even going to zoom any more than that let's see i was looking at ecuador oh well oh well done all right it's gonna class come on so let's have a look at the next two rounds and see if we can still get good scores on those there's loads of information here um again doesn't mean i can interpret it properly codex dot cl cl oh that's the one i've not seen before don't tell me this is columbia maybe it is oh god i recognize that flag but i really need to study these flags at some point um okay let's have a look what else we got um see that's that caro again dot cl could that be columbia it could bacon it still need to find a town name uh where are we gonna find a town name are we by the city because that would be helpful let's have a quick zoom down here looks like we are by the sea and the sea is to the northwest so we could be around here could be up around here hmm okay this is becoming a bit more gettable let's just plonk ourselves there a minute so looks like we've got a port commercial port going on here and let's see if we can get the port name [Music] and the big old rock the boat and presser porcher arica we've seen erika before on a sign um might not be in colombia can't see anything with that name here um maybe blow my idea right out of the water be in here somewhere no definitely a big port hmm hmm so i'm looking at the wrong country ah flags i know i've seen this flag okay i am going to have a look around all the ports around all of these countries and i am going to find this place i will be back i found a place called arika in chile i think this might be the place uh actually [Music] maybe it is okay so there's a port so yeah that looks about right so i came along this road uh let's just pop us there a moment where did we come from he went this way didn't we um did we turn off at some point let's go back to the beginning that'd be the easiest way so we are northwest to the seafront can we get a road name here it's number 211 don't think there's a road name here let's see you've got one junction just one dunk junction down from the sea um so one of these somewhere um i don't think we're that far let's i think finding a hotel is probably a good bet but let's see we've got one junction crossroads not really what's this bolo nessie so it looks like a little alley central commercial is it this one bolognesi here we go here we go um i think we might be [Music] right here um so that was a commercial shop that we saw behind us here i think central commercial compraventa it doesn't say watch stall i think we're here i really do i think we're here and i'm gonna stick with that let's see okay oh that was amazing i'm very proud of myself how did you guys do on that one did you already know that that flag was chilly and i should really get a grip and learn these things yeah yeah i know all right go on last round let's get a perfect score on everything but one so definitely literally dot i t commune de morengo [Music] uh what we got here big old churchy thing um excuse me central restaurant and not going to tell me oh red signs booboo bar oh it is that's cute via roma so that's the road name i presume these road signs will just traffic lights jacket lights uh right post pagasano and treviglio some very british pronunciations of that and sand something road named so i guess try and find those places [Music] um not sure how easy that is um to fake leo it's trying to think if i know them but i don't i don't think so uh do i want to scour around italy possibly can i just see a quick glance no no right like get more information yes all right all right okay all right so where else can i get more information probably down here plenty of street names that's nice but need a town name and possibly an area lounge bar why not why not is that the same names wasn't it uh i think i'm gonna have to look for these names here um [Music] still don't know what town we're in though i'm gonna have a look for these names i will speed this up this is a very long video and i'll be right back okay i can't i can't find it so i found a few of the places on on the road signs so i think it's got to be around here somewhere so i ain't going to plunk it here and i will see where we were 3.6 miles not bad so when i go down here and it's a bit further north in morengo morengo there's a commune commune de morango oh well i am quite happy with that maybe i should have persevered my head is a bit all over the place after this long game ah not perfect score though two two one five eight so less than i got last time let me know how you did in the comments below and uh i will get a perfect score on this map this is gonna be my new challenge to myself it's gonna happen so make sure you watch it

welcome back another gia guesser another play along uh i thought it was about time i did the weatherspoons map so being from the uk um if you don't know or haven't watched geo wizard for some reason um check him out this uh is a chain of pubs in the uk that's really cheap um they are all over the place as you can see here there there are 869 quite a few um so i thought it'd be a good fun map to play so let's dive straight into this set it as a challenge the link will be in the description box below if you want to play along you don't need to have um pay for geoguessa to play any of the challenge links you can just play them without having to pay which is handy so um let's start this game where are we first off the crystal palace are we in crystal palace which is london don't know what else we got here buses um first travel i think first group hillington ibrox um city center which city oh i'm not sure what else jury's in matalan little um curry's i can't see where that bus is going um what else bingo um i might have to move around i guess music drink food make saulies i'll bust up here can't read that let's see if we can get a bit closer uh kilmarnock so we in scotland eastward newton meres um hmm oh first glasgow there we go then looks like we're in glasgow uh nothing else there right let's see let's dive straight in see if we can find this weather spoons probably in the center it's called crystal palace wasn't it uh nope don't know much about glasgow so i'm not sure where is that a main center somewhere else i presume would be right in the center somewhere so i thought around here um some more over here no maybe we need to zoom in a little bit lots of things there we are crystal palace so we were opposite carphone warehouse i think we're right on the junction opposite lidl and matalan so probably there yes good good start right come on more like that the joseph els elsewhat joseph house so we've got a tram not many places in the uk with trams um old market square um what else we got here nottingham nottingham poetry festival we've got some uh good things going here on these maps so joseph els nottingham uh where is nottingham nowadays like it's changed um nothing over here we go in the center quick scan see if we can see it there it is perfect opposite tram stop here let's just have a quick look a bit further down from the tram stop probably here come on yes now i feel it's going to go downhill from here let's fingers crossed keeps going like this the brigade brigade rain or shine our garden is open that's nice where are we it's like a little town many little towns look like this so green's way does that say leeds might say leads garf post office um you see if we get closer to this bus stop i don't know if i'm going to get any further with that no car fourth so that's probably the name of the town not what i've heard of um see come on these little signs here uh where'd they go huh go forth miner's welfare hall so could be up leads way maybe [Music] uh anything else my computer's decided to go slow again which is awesome anything else up here okay i know go forth but where in the country is that pop up here a bit another pub and lead building society so i think maybe looking around the leads is our best bet so let's get in there and elites now golf perfect brigade here we go probably around here let's just go back where's the bus stop just there so here come on yes [Music] i think it's got to go downhill at some point though come on uh right plumbing and heating retford how do you say the domini domini cross interesting name durham's heating so could we be in durham and nothing else on that van about you richford could be the name the turks head authentic cantonese restaurant fred's interesting um okay i saw a road sign down here so let's have a look so we got gainsborough walks up newark that's all up north isn't it when i say up north anything above the downs to me is up north so anything above brighton including that way it's all up north okay uh all right gainesborough and what did that say uh [Music] let's go back here what did that truck say that room so um hmm i think durham's around here again isn't it is it down here oh i'm terrible with anything north um right we can find this we can do this we can do this where am i going [Music] um i might have to speed this one up unfortunately but we'll see maybe i'll stumble across it in a minute i can't remember what i'm looking for there's darum and gainsborough all right let's pop back here again yeah gainesville walks up newark hmm guys walks up um there's gainsborough okay where are we so there's quite a lot of little places around here so let's put that here a minute so a1 a1 and a631 so a1a1 [Music] a631 okay we're probably around here where's newark maybe that's the town we're in and why can't i see it am i being blind so anyone to gainsborough going in the compass north so north walks up is also north my eyes are not working today where are we now so hey what there it is there so newark should be well there's somewhere right okay i might well speed this up in a bit but i am going to have a look to see if we can find out exactly what town we are in because i think that will help us and hopefully this school might give us a clue um no it's not gonna give me a clear view on that sign wellness center ah this is going a lot slower than i would like i think you guys have already got it you're already there moving on don't know why i'm being so slow disappointed i know i'm sorry new street all through traffic all through what what are we going through funeral care nice nottinghamshire council retford okay right i have a feeling that's probably the town so i'll probably speed this up but i'm looking for retford now i'll see you in a bit finally found redford so hopefully it's here there it is gosh that took far too long opposite turks head right yep next to the turks head basically so i reckon we're there too long too long find these little places right last round can this be a perfect score i don't think i've got a perfect score on this one yet be great to get that done on camera so the coinage hall very hilly looking place and what else children's hospice south west okay some lovely hills um which way do i go i want to go down here and look at that let's go down there and look at that that looks cool check some stuff on the way cornwall cornwall right cornwall is quite big um any idea on town can we see nope um have a good look around i mean i want to see what this is this looks cool to the memory of hmm something millet crawls not sure what that says that's cool this is a lovely looking place nettles fish and chip restaurant is there a place called nettles could be could be all right seriously have a look at some signs to see where we are let's see am i not going to be able to see that little one i don't think so it go why the signs keep disappearing on me today all right uh oh can we see this bus damn go down here no no no bus oh that's handy okay museum tourist information boating lake penrose walks and lou pool i know where lou is i've been there uh can she remember where it is uh it's spelt differently that was just one oh now i don't think that's cornwall now this is the other issue is i can never remember where each of these counties begin end and all of that um okay we're around here somewhere office there a minute right we can find something we can find some sign somewhere uh hellston that sounds like a place that definitely sounds like a place no i hope this is cornwall isn't it the bottom part terrible arnold um so i'm gonna have a look around for helston um [Music] should i just have a quick look see there's anything else i can find so that says helstone let's corroborate shall we um don't think this is gonna say bus stop bus stops are helpful then we'll have a look at the church oh yeah i can zoom in on that one maybe this way around no jj news church some methodist church hellston so right definitely hellston um no idea where that is gotta be one of these green bits so i'm gonna have a look around and try and find helstone i'll be back okay i finally found that took me too long too too long right here we go coinage hall weatherspoons let's see where we started and what we've got behind us children's hospice so we're probably here all right let's see that just took far too long but perfect score perfect score nice oh that's so good finally got a perfect score on this map that was lovely i think we got very lucky with the rounds um i won't say it because i've got better but i don't think that's happened yet well awesome let me know how you did in the comments below didn't beat me maybe you did it faster than me though let me know um i'll probably do this map again it's quite easy uh maybe i'll do timed rounds to make it a bit shorter and a bit harder possibly but still i enjoyed it i hope you did too and i'll see you next time bye you ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 55.85752873442608, "lng": -4.257084347885948}, {"round": 2, "lat": 52.95310500830187, "lng": -1.149756774575255}, {"round": 3,

"hello welcome back another geographer another play along um i've got a new mic set up again so hopefully this will sound better i'm not sure about the traffic today how that will sound but hopefully it's not too bad um so i thought i'd try this map united states famous places which is one of the editors choice maps so um it's an easy one hopefully we'll have some good times but let's give it a go so there's a challenge link will be in the description box below if you want to play along and let's see what we get all right another place i recognize um [Music] hmm very interesting not something i've ever seen [Music] um very interesting so it's a photosphere so we're not going to be able to move anywhere um i have no clues there's the obligatory flag some mountains maybe um hmm no i dear so that's a good start mm-hmm um i don't know the states very well either so i can't even get a feel of where it could be uh i'm not gonna be able to read that sign no uh okay uh what else can we go by um really nothing is there um okay so let's presume the compass is correct there's mountains to the east i can't see any over there but we're quite low down i think so ah right let's get the map up so mountains to the east it's a fair few mountains it's quite dark so maybe up here sunnier down here oh i don't know it's probably quite overcast over here sometimes too um i'm gonna go one of these states let's go idaho don't worry probably a fairly big city maybe idaho falls is that a big city don't look that big uh any landmarks oh it does look bigger when you stupid um doesn't there's no markers for anything unless it's this memorial park oh the cemetery okay maybe not that um no maybe not here okay let's try somewhere else um i might speed this up if it takes a while or it takes a while for the rest of the the game so i'm just gonna look around some mountains to the east a fairly big city like buffalo um and then look for some landmarks hopefully we'll find something somewhere okay i'm not having much luck just randomly going to places um now i think it could be university um but i can't find anything i have no clues where this could be so i might go to boulder i've got loads of university buildings here some of them look you know some very nice looking buildings maybe that pond or whatever it is is not on the map um i think this field is probably too big this doesn't look like the right building ah just lost on this one scale model solar um so [Music] i might put it somewhere here somewhere it's not going to be it but i need to put it somewhere this has gone on long enough okay well not too far away ah didn't go over here got the compass mixed up again didn't i so i was looking for the mountains or on the west oh what an idiot what an idiot okay let's see what it is temple square salt lake city utah temple okay well there you go now we know just a reminder that i don't know how to use bloody compass all right come on next one's gonna be what the hell is that a giant ball of yarn world's largest ball of sisal twine started by frank somebody well there you go um where the hell are we kowiker cities ball of twine and we can't move um we know the town what about the state i mean this reminds me of maybe like texas that is not an educated guess of any means um [Music] okay cow eco city um [Music] i'm presuming this is not a big place where do i start looking maybe new mexico how weaker all right i'm gonna have a look for this it's gonna be another long one let's see what i find okay i'm not good with the stakes at all i can't find anything probably not zoomed in enough to see it but um i found this area that has a lot of places with city in the name webster city rockwell city lake city dao city so i think i might just plonk it around here somewhere i don't even know what state this is um let's plonk it here where are we we're in iowa okay uh let's have another quick look see if i can't see cowicker however you pronounce it i don't think that's going to be possible i'm sure it is if i really spent the time but i'm not going to so let's try this this is only the second round okay not far there it is so i should have been out to see that but i didn't i didn't notice it but i'm not too upset about that not too far not across the other side of the states i guess this is quite central though isn't it yeah okay never mind next round come on something i already know no paul revere the signal lanterns of paul revere the steeple of this church won the country of the march of the british troops to lexington and concord okay so lexington and concord episcopal church something christ church is that gonna say boston this is boston hull street salem street coffee shop um do i want to spend time looking around let's just see oh yeah we can see this old north church okay that's great um see we can get away from this blur i don't know what it's blurring out okay wonderful boston right so old north church boston um go to europe boston's over here somewhere right isn't it great i don't even know where boston is where are you going boston there it is oh my god right old north church is that it is that what is it yeah oh i'm in the church um no i didn't know you could get that close but it is old north church awesome not a big long one this time we are on salem street probably around here i think let's go yes ah okay another one like that next please is this disney ugh i think so um that in florida i don't know i presume this is disney it's gotta be hasn't it um right looks sunny so let's florida's down here um is it all in orlando oh i have no idea i presume it will stand out though right disneyland discovery cove oh here you go walt disney world resort of course there's no pictures of the buildings um there's a lot of disney stuff around here um oh there's a star wars thing that's cool oh my god i didn't realize it was so big um okay so castle frozen no um japan [Music] that's the big round golf ball thing isn't it the epcot um [Music] where's the cask i thought it would be on here wouldn't it maybe as it says other disney's as well i'm sure in america but it's got to be around here isn't it where imagineering am i just not reading it um space no um maybe it's the united kingdom one with historical buildings i sat in the distance uh as a flag as well don't know um but it's not even disney it will turn out is this frozen no idea oh what was that over there what's this looks like some kind of statue or something um right where am i gonna put where am i gonna put it gotta be here somewhere boardwalk resort i must take so long to get around this place okay i'm gonna leave it i'm gonna leave it here yeah let's do it let's see oh my god was it a disney it was a disney just the other disney yeah sleeping beauty oh well um where is that anaheim in in california right okay i'll remember that next time world of coca-cola right where are you old coca-cola where's coca-cola from it's official coverage so i can move about um let's pop over here an aquarium i love aquariums um can we see these signs no this sign atlanta olympic park and that's georgia aquarium okay so atlanta's over here where's atlanta i just been blind um atlantis state isn't it ah so clueless with america this is bad idea this map bad idea where are you atlanta oh george's okay george's estate atlanta is the city right um world of coca-cola there we go we are probably here um where's the aquarium there's the aquarium so we were probably here on this corner here right there let's go okay i don't think i'll do this map again but uh how did you do i mean i was all over the place look blimey blimey not good in points ah how did you do do you know the state's a lot better than i do you found a disney did you get that one right without being across the other side of the country rubbish let me know how you did in the comments below um i'm gonna try doing another map now to cheer myself up after this one

welcome back um today i am going to put myself through punishment and do flags of the world um i've somehow done this map before in five minutes that doesn't sound right so maybe that was a challenge link where it was timed rounds um i do not expect to be able to do it in five minutes or get that score but let's see maybe i've got better i've seen a few more flags [Music] we shall see so let's get into this game make it a challenge invite you lot link will be in the description below and uh let's go right um [Music] yep yep i don't know the flag and to me it looks like thailand but it might not be might be ah could be anywhere like cambodia or something oh um okay i don't think it's a thai flag i don't know why uh it's photosphere by beth boren so it's unofficial coverage so vietnam is that a star or something else i don't think that's a star i don't know what laos's flag looks like um oh my amar i could really do with some language but i don't think i can see any of that here tantalizingly close oh no can't really make that out hmm good start i told you i wasn't any better okay sorry about that let's just make a decision and go um i don't know brunei i don't know brunei's flag either but it looked like it was different writing than that doesn't mean that they don't use this kind of text um gotta study those flags right i think it's one of these uh i am going with i'm gonna go with laos let's go with laos and we will go quite a strange shape country isn't it probably around here right yeah yeah let's go here and royal palace sounds good uh here i very much doubted this ability oh no oh there's cambodia i nearly backtracked and went cambodia but never mind i should go with my gut next time where were we ministry of information you weren't very informative all right let's try the next one um flag oh oh another little flag i don't know do you guys know these flags are these flags that you know let me know that was easy for you the last round and this one i mean where are we um i can't really see any texts either it's a terrible picture so another uneducated guess i think amazing when the camera angle is weird like this so i'm gonna have to go with this and this looks french um [Music] so french is probably going to be africa um so like most of this area speaks french maybe my friend burkina faso let's go barkina for sale um looking for a petrol station i guess at least petrol station yeah and i saw a pharmacy just near okay not that pharmacy so that says pharmacy rather than from that make a difference let's see if we can find another one at least it's sort of spelt the same pharmacy pharmacy du facao okay there's a la um [Music] okay i might speed this up but i am gonna have a look for this pharmacy i think that might be possible um if i have the right country all right let me have a scare around see can we see this one no have a scar around and i'll see in a bit okay i didn't have the luck to happen upon it which is a shame um but i am going to stick with my first thought it's in burkina faso i'm sorry if you can hear that engine noise some reason somebody's revving um so i am going to pop it here somewhere never seen so many pharmacies somewhere it's crazy um let's pop it here let's just go for that come on is it the right country not at all not at all it was burundi uh terrible [Music] can we even see the pharmacy no so i spent all that time we've never been seen it anyway all right moving on oh i should learn not to do these flag games because i just don't know it's like a lot's going on here though we got here um no idea so this is dissolved took the picture i have no idea what flag this is is that frozen what the hell is going on um right um this one kind of reminds me of um i can't even think of the name now like mongolia maybe that's it should i go with my heart these give me panasonic that looks like an olympic symbol isn't it hmm [Music] interesting interesting um might go just because i had a thought of that is this the capital i presume we're in the capital or that building am i going to severely embarrass myself quite likely let's see sure it's going to be a square like this parliament building sound about right let's pop us here and uh see amazing i got one right and that was just going with my heart popping it somewhere oh my god you're serious well that's it i'm done late video here my god wow okay good let the next round be like that please there's a flag ah okay so we've got a few flags here um is that puerto rico i have my brain today yeah puerto rico flag this looks like some kind of old fort i guess who's it taken by steven proto um [Music] yeah i think this looks like some kind of old fort doesn't necessarily mean that we're in this country does it i'm presuming this looks like the puerto rico flag i did well last time let's just please hope that i will do well this time too right yes please so some kind of old fort you would think that would be on the coast um quick scan around the coast that's lagrange can that be no coast of coast thought i don't know uh scout scout scan maybe it's a little island sorry i keep hitting the microphone um maybe it's on a little island um [Music] scan around here let's see what we can find i think it have a historical symbol wouldn't you castillo this is a fort i guess so that's citadel built by the spanish it doesn't excuse me it doesn't look like citadel latin american art in old army barracks hmm a few there a moment it does look like old army barracks um is there any art going on i don't know can't see anything else doesn't look like the right shape so this is too square and that's a bit odd shaped but that's what we've got at the moment four over here okay so we're getting some thoughts i'm convinced this is the right country let's see interpretive signs what that means don't think it's that one move on [Music] now i'm going to stick with that army barracks i don't think it's the right shape i'm convinced from the right country though only one way to find out let's go oh it was this one didn't look like a 16th century citadel but i'm very happy with that again very close right place let's see what doom the last round brings uh singapore isn't it but that's the chinese flag okay confusing but this is official coverage uh unless it's hong kong not singapore i've probably got those mixed up have i mandarin oriental um is this hong kong i haven't moved around all games so see if we can get this one without moving uh let's have a look at hong kong where am i going over here so what parts of main part could be on either couldn't it i don't know i don't know so i guess find mandarin oriental it's a chaita road chatter road mandarin oriental [Music] right i might speed this one up if it takes too long i'm going to look for the mandarin oriental and not make you sit through it because you sat through me doing enough ah okay i'm glad i persevered with that found cha chata road there's a mandarin oriental so we just need to work out where we are here so says 6 to 14 [Music] do we get numbers on the map i doubt it 7 11 here i need to work out properly okay so there's the hotel and that is to new new compass to the west hotel here to the west so we must be down here somewhere um could that building there be the courts are we here can we see the other road sign [Music] yes jackson road oh i am glad i carried on with that one probably around here come on come on got a new badge yay awesome thank you okay so i think i beat my previous score not in five minutes at all but yeah very happy with that how did you guys do did you know all these flags am i just rubbish with flags and need to learn let me know how you did in the comments below and i'll see you in the next one

"hello welcome back another geo guest another play along today i am going to do city skylines which sounded very interesting so let's see how we get on with this one um skylines around the world no photo spheres but some official unofficial street view so let's see what kind of places we get and if we can recognize them all right let's uh get into this game so there's a challenge the link will be in the description box below if you want to play along and uh let's start the game wow um a bit of a weird camera thing i guess uh okay so this looks like korea uh it's official coverage is that the city i guess that's the city over there hmm interesting on a big old bridge we're all just a road that goes along the coast hmm mtv i wonder if that's a tv show no uh okay so what can we find here maybe if we go down here it's getting sunnier to one of these signs nearly that engine okay cool doesn't give us anything so this is a good one so we're going east towards incheon and okkku park [Music] okay so yeah there's a lot of islands around here so i guess the city skyline is is it inching um we're going east towards it what was the park name ok park see if we can see that on here maybe we have to be more zoomed in um [Music] trying to think what skyline we're seeing so we're going along the coast aren't we maybe it's this one um [Music] it didn't feel like there was nothing on the other side did it there's all this industrial stuff going on here uh maybe we should have a look at the sign further down what's this one say uh young handy so it's going tando harbour and gengar harbour tango um unless the skyline we're looking at is soul sure don't know um could be could be anywhere come on me let's see we can get this we can get this i'm trying to find that park as well that we saw um yeah i'm not so convinced now so let's have another look at this there's quite an expanse of water but we can see another bridge over there and a city skyline possibly here i guess that's maybe a harbour another harbour um so that's young john doe spelt slightly differently be helpful okay um and it could be the same place and then die boodle is down here and that's going west i guess hmm could we be around here sorry again quiet then i just don't know how to work this out this is so confusing to me um we're looking at a big expanse of water it could be here so you would go west west maybe that road to incheon um we've got some harbours which i can't see i'm gonna go for here because i'm obviously having a problem with this let's say we're here and let's see okay close but no cigar oh is this place not this one that was silly wasn't it oh wow but close enough i'm happy not so bad let's see what we have next okay so please see the sun is in the south so we're in the northern hemisphere it's a nice bay is that a a lake or a bay it's like a big old cruise ship so i say that's going out to sea at some point uh looks like a nice hanging out spot got some cacti what's this place called srot was so so okay i don't know i can't pronounce her does that give us anything no um okay it's a nice place to hang out good view of the city what city is it though so coasters to the east i'm gonna try this other compass let's see okay here oh yeah so it's a bit easier that compass okay so c is to the east we're in the northern hemisphere so could be anywhere around here maybe um c is to the east so maybe any of these areas couldn't it any of these places um [Music] do we have a look around can we see any lines for fairies look like it that's a shame because if we can find a port then that would be a lot easier um all right shall we have a look around see what else there is i think it could take quite a while down this wiggly road to get to anything useful can we jump over there do i spend the time doing this yes because i have no other clues of where to go to oh that's nice isn't it um kind of looks closed in so look at that ah it's gonna be a while till we see a sign this might take too long okay so it is definitely out to see this takes ages i might speed it up i'm just going to go down this road until i can find something of any use okay so i found this sign here with a dot i t uh web address which is italy right this is italy obviously there's a mountains and stuff it doesn't feel right though so i'm going to carry on and see if i can find anything else um [Music] i mean the language kind of adds up now so i'm gonna quick zoom around um okay and euros and there's the two blue marks on the uh uh license plate so that means it's an italian license plate um so where are we hmm so i'm glad i did look around because otherwise i would have gone into south america or bottom half of north america don't spend too long on this so i mean that doesn't mean we're in the palomar place oh maybe i'm thinking of palmer so if it's in italy i don't see there being cactus up here it's more likely to be down here somewhere oh palermo okay that's got some mountains okay i'm liking this um if you can hear that scratching that's the cap of the door uh let's have a look uh let's go back to the beginning let's put pin here so i don't forget oops okay back to the beginning okay so what was the name of this what's um so we were looking at the bay oh there's lots of boats coming in here does that seem right though so we said it was to the east okay it could be could be up here so there's a wiggly road with a footpath and there's a photo point it could be this grotto here ah probably around here somewhere if this is the right place um how far up do you think we are i think we're not that far up but we're definitely further up than this one i think so i think we might be around here another look so that carries on up yep i think we're there let's have a look come on nice nice so it was worth spending all that time having a look around oh wow i'm very pleased about that come on next round right another sunny climb and some number plates i don't recognize what language we've got here not sure yeah that says ve tv don't know that can be relevant at all electricity thing on the outside very busy so another beach side so it's not the french flag is it yes i'm no better with flags than i have been before so that's good um right some probably behind the building maybe we have a look at the uh shadows not really sure where they're going i'm sorry if he's very slow today um so i don't know right above us that's the problem okay don't post give us anything no um so i know it's worth having a walk down a walk down here on the last game but i'd like to try without doing that so i'm going to go with the satellite saying ve tv that we might be in venezuela possibly so maybe up here that doesn't really work does it nope okay let's see where so this is to the south really isn't it the water so that's not it's not gonna work unless it's here maybe is that no because we're looking down to the south to the city no no i can't yet okay so seas to the south so when i'm going to the americas again it just seems right do i remember somebody saying that these outside electric things are in mexico i'm not really sure though so it could maybe it's one of these areas panama it's got little bits out here so i've got a mountain the little bits uh i'll pop you here a minute right so we're looking to a bay that's kind of pinched a lot of stuff coming out i'm not sure we're here either okay let's keep looking i might speed this up again if i take a while i was gonna have a look around the coast and see if there's anything that looks similar around here okay i'm not having much fun here so i've written off argentina and brazil because i know those flags don't look like the one we saw hoping that is the flag of the country um the only place i could find that looks a bit like it could be this place is here in montevideo but again i'm not 100 sold on that but i can't think where else we could be so i'm gonna go here let's see it was mexico ah i thought the mexico flag got green in it am i just being blind ah never mind hold 26 points wonderful i'm sure those of you i know your flags are probably going that's not a real flag or that is mexico's flag what an idiot all right moving on let's just forget about that where are we now um interesting skyline what's that the cops are out um i'm mounting over there i'll look at those in a minute so we've got yellow things uh so we around australia where's the sun maybe right above us again yeah um so let's have a look at these signs some number plates don't really help me unless it's european okay so this looks spanish again maybe hmm [Music] down here i just have no feel for this at all alto sir alto so weird okay so we're driving on the right we've got yellow markings there's probably not around australia so look down here [Music] strange it went faster zoom zoom zoom [Music] anything here max he doesn't seem happy don't take a picture of me sorry uh give me something gas yes so we decided that was spanish my last video i think um so a spanish-speaking country i can't i feel like i should be able to get more out of that but my eyes are not seeing it okay big old junction um bike shop don't know another bike shop sign where do we go to get more information ah do i plonk it again but i don't want to what do you say 9-1-1 isn't that like the american um emergency number i don't know how many other countries have the same so i don't know that helps [Music] no i don't that's probably information that i just don't realize is useful information this looks like the same kind of lamppost we saw in the last round and it was mexico and we've got the electricity things on the side do you think mexico again papaleria i think possibly we are in mexico and so on that basis let's go back to the start so anything else here i can use to gauge yeah probably middle in the middle of the country somewhere and this weird place was called out something altose information alto sir let's see i don't know how we're going to find this um mexico city is very landlocked it looked like quite a big city oh there's a lot going on um so we were looking [Music] let's go back that's a massive city and that's to the north west so would be down here somewhere it's getting hilly and mountainous down here uh let's have a quick look and see if i can find alto sir around here somewhere wish me luck okay nice such luck of course um so i'm going to put it around here somewhere anyway so kind of looking north east ish this is north west so let's go fairly central north and pop it somewhere here i might zoom out a bit pop it otherwise i'll just keep looking let's pop it here go on at least we're in the right country so not not so bad on points right ah there's alto sir oh well not too bad still middle of mexico it's okay all right last round on this disastrous map for me let's see nice golden bridges um iron city beer it's like a nice funicular is that what that's called um peoples okay so we are in america ohio river boulevard very pretty okay let's see if we can find it without moving too much so we've got these root numbers i guess we're in ohio which is around here somewhere there it is oh cool lake eerie so is there a big old river i can't see one um my house there can't see a big old river let's find the road so 279 okay so i had to look around i couldn't find i found route 9 little 19 but not 279. so i found pittsburgh trip which i guess is a newspaper or something so now i just need to work out where we started so lovely golden bridges um another bridge there another bridge here we are facing south a few bridges here um and there's that iron something and the vernicular that was going up the hill do you think that would be on the map for walking on game days okay um so that's just a heritage walk all the way around we saw a bridge off to the side here so this bends round so looking for it to bend round to the west it's around here or maybe around here maybe around here um yeah so the funicular would be down here wouldn't it says 279 um [Music] i can't believe how slow i'm being on this game i'm really sorry uh there's a stadium there's a tunnel oh here you go this is the incline so people's something don't know what that is maybe that's just a sign [Music] um that looks like a stadium [Music] that would be over here wouldn't it there's a stadium uh i reckon we're on this bridge yes i reckon we're on this bridge so let's just go for it last round come on still right country right city wrong bridge but fine i will take it let me know in the comments how you did because i did terribly i think let's have a look at the summary uh yeah okay not great i don't know where my mind was at this was not the game for me all the time to do it i think i hope you did better than me let me know in the comments below and uh i'll see you on the next game which hopefully i'll do better bye ", "locations":

welcome back uh i've just recorded a video and i didn't do so well so i wanted to do another one straight after and redeem myself a bit i've chosen train stations in the uk we'll start with b yes i've chosen b because i'm hoping that brighton will be in it um and i'm hoping that this will uh do better than the last one of course now the cat wants to get out all right so let's hope for some easy-ish places and not some obscure little villages i don't know uh so let's invite friends and let's start the game right um it's martin's queen's way it's a very strange building grand central we have buildings like this in the uk got to be london right starts with b debenhams it's the entrance looks like some very smart people let's have a look over here and can we see what that says just station entrance um is this maybe birmingham then oh there you go birmingham new street okay so that's a nice easy one to start off with and let's find birmingham new street here we are right where's the crazy entrance maybe this one let's have a look that's oh hang on that says grand central here let's have a look at the look at the compass okay let's go back okay so we're looking at the building and it is to the west so we should be around here then i guess [Music] okay so not maybe where i put my marker are you ready oh ready uh so we're on a walkway aren't we there's another walkway there maybe hmm tk max over there and debenhams see if we can find those um can't see them at first glance it's a very interesting place i can't see tk maxx and debenhams hang on looking at the station it's to the so obviously i haven't got better from early as one ah let's see come on come on we can do this there's some more stuff over here oh that's the ball ring of course um so is it an entrance coming from the boring we also had an odeon can we see odin on here there's odie in here here we are we must be here because there's that walkway that goes round we probably started here it's ocean there that means we must have tk max over here doesn't say so it doesn't mean it isn't there but i am going with that because that makes that west not the other way around right okay let's go for the hat oh nice look at that three yards okay better i think i'm more awake now come on right why do i feel like i recognize this i'm not sure i have been here tesco's hackney carriages cyril's taxi what station are you can't really read it oh terrible quality so many directions let's go this way uh bridlington let's just check because yep riddlington right and i say that like i know where bridlington is and i don't so i guess it's on this coast judging by that map so is it a big place brittlington i'm gonna scan down here quickly and see bridlington here we go lovely bridlington station um where's the station builders that's the car park so it must be here tesco's there i'll probably go here let's just go back so we are on the road maybe to the corner maybe around here come on oh yards amazing oh loving this game right come on i'll make it hard for you guys to beat me on this one um right so that looks like it's london signage yeah thames path church something velvety mini caps hmm what's the name of this station though is it actually called belvedere never heard of a place called belvedere right so it's a small station in london near the thames path right that make sense i know i don't know where that begins and ends so let's see if we can just get anything else from this so it's definitely um [Music] yeah what's the word residential area london network of bike paths we got here then so green chain walk frank's park don't know thames innovation center cross nest nature reserve tens path and thames cycle route um and the river thames the river thames is over this way which is to the north so we should be on this side of the river i guess um the innovation center rings a bell for some reason ah why can't think because i remember this being something like that when i went to the olympics but i can't even remember where that was so that doesn't help me that's all does it right okay let's start does it say where the thames path is not really um so maybe it's easier to just scan for a area like here that says petersham should be one called belvedere uh and what's the other somebody's park [Music] industrial state eris this lesson abbey woods maybe i'll find some of these places i might well speed this up because i guess it might take me a little while see if i can find this place do ah find it fantastic i was not going to give up on that one right what side are we on probably this one and let's just have a check so we said it was too that looks like a dead end that way and it was to the north to the thames thames is up that way so i reckon we are here ah fantastic okay next one ben fleet then fleet hmm fleet of bends that's some quiet no thought that was a main road but it's not uh ben fleet where on earth are you um pink probably means something you know which railway it is but i'm not sure um which railway company that is so station entrance is up that way um a quick look here it's kind of recognizable the pink but i can't think what company that is maybe this bus can tell me don't go bus bus went no no [Music] there's a river this is there a river called fleet am i just making that up tems way brilliant up thames again so maybe this is out essex way let's have a quick look um that's what i was thinking of lots of water around here ben's fleet it's right next to a river so that's a bit helpful you've got this train line here it doesn't look like that goes along a river until around here leon c let's have a quick look down oh here you go benfleet awesome probably here so there's the bus stops that looks like goes down a tunnel which i think was here yes i think we're there oh very happy with this is this the last round yeah last round not brighton oh well i obviously didn't need it well don't talk too soon no idea where this is yet um i don't see the sign another tesco so we know tesco's like to hang around train stations oh here we go buck shaw parkway parkway yeah buckshaw parkway there's another london one northern oh i don't know not another london one buck shaw parkway the buckshore on the northern line so that could be anywhere hmm there's probably a reason they use parkway because i believe there's another a number of places that have that name um the northern line has run from london up to the north as far as i know maybe i need to have a look around a bit more information see whereabouts not sure just quickly scanning them up like this is going to give me anything let's have a look around let's have a look down yes down this way and actual parkway offices it's like an industrial estate doesn't that you say tesco chorley julie buckshaw some strange names here so charlie rings a bell trolley now i don't know why surely i'm thinking of hawley which is near me totally totally tally i'm going to try and get more information this isn't working does it need to know maybe what's the next town along um it's just car park isn't it looks like some new builds i don't know if there's going to be anything this way like just an industrial estate see if we get to a big road now this sign will give us something buckshaw buckshaw link so there's lots of names going on here lots of buildings buck shores blinds okay so i think we're definitely looking for buckshaw right another phone number doesn't help me don't know them um good old harvester let's just say it must be the car park for the war horse um all right shaw avenue is that a school trinity school buckshaw village church of england and a methodist right so it's a village ah so that's gonna be a lot harder to find so i definitely want to find a main road that way or this way let me go this way so on main road i'm hoping to find a road sign that gives us an a or an m road to look for and cool there's a road sign here m6 preston right which is uh i think it's further up isn't it tell me that there's preston okay cool so it's got to be around here buckshaw village here we go where's your train station there it is parkway lovely where are we on this side let's have a look around around about the station here so we're around here i think let's go yes oh good god i feel redeemed from my earlier recording and i don't know if i'll um put this one out first or the previous one we'll see maybe this one because i'm not happy about it but i'll definitely put the other one out anyway at some point yeah that was great maybe i should try this map again with a time limit or no moving i needed to move a lot to get information one day maybe no moving but let me know how you did in the comments below did you know that london one very bizarre one to me and uh i'll see you next time thanks bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 52.47814483533723, "lng": -1.8972691688387613}, {"round": 2, "lat": 54.08417767377948, "lng": -0.19808848343950558},

"hello happy new year because i know it'll be new year by the time i get this out so happy new year i hope you all had a nice christmas and a new year's eve um i spent most of my time with family so had a lovely time which is why i haven't played much geoguesser at all over the holidays so sorry for not bringing anything out but here we are again um another player along that as kfc was the last one i did i thought i'll do mcdonald's best to be fair um i've played this map before a while ago got a very decent score i think but took me a while so um let's see how well i can do being recorded and trying to beat you guys so let's play this game um i'm not going to do five minutes per round use the default settings so that is a challenge and now let's start this game so looks american to me um yeah i'd say american there's the mcdonald's very different to any mcdonald's i'm used to seeing so that comfort in hampton inn and a quality inn so looks like a roadside stop grier street 16th avenue um hardy's don't know what that is see who this sign goes oh no go back one let's see we can don't think we're gonna get that sign again are we okay where else can we get some information first bank something first bank cats are fighting of course they like to wait until filming um right so it's definitely the us you've got the us flag there so that's good give me a county or a city please um circle k something else captain d's seafood kitchen home depot all the standards by the looks of it but nothing tells me where we are do you sonoco fuel of the nazca that's right i said the nurse car um okay let's go down here subway we run down here i think one of the cats is running under my desk so uh hopefully this won't cut uh i saw a sign back here somewhere oh there's a rocket u.s air force is there an army base here there's big sign up there right i am definitely out of practice just staring at the screen right now uh best customer service in town okay what town what town no nothing on there okay let's get to this highway there's got to be oh look here we go this is useful so south interstate 75 300 and this is usually a picture of the state i believe let's have a look right let's get this over this side so can i match that up with the study i don't know this is true hopefully it is um let's see is it missouri how's that little dip oh no it dips further down on that picture um any other states look like that louisiana looks like an l doesn't it no i should probably give up on this line of sinking because i don't know if it's necessarily true don't you know okay so i'm going to look for interstate 75 so i say george on there uh where's georgia gone georgia no that doesn't say george's is it all right let's go well there's the 75 okay okay cool so 75 goes up here as well so we can find road 300 i think we might have to be zoomed in for that all right is it one of these rows these little ones here okay i'll probably speed this up i'm gonna have a look around for the row 300 and see if i can find that anywhere here okay i realize the 75 goes through quite a few states so i'm going to see if i can find anything that will tell me what uh city or town we are in oh cool cordell cordell hawks in hawkinsville okay i'll have a look around for that cordell and hawkingsville okay i found a place called cordell here so do we think this is the right one so there's a 75 there's the 300. we were probably here home depot and where's the mcdonald's ah okay so holiday inn and everything that we saw there's kfc well to be honest i just expected to see it on the map so that's not helpful right i'll be in fairfield home depot we saw after we came down the road a bit um so we further down this way i'll just go in back and have a look it's probably the best idea isn't it yes pop the pin there that's the beginning okay so there's comfort in hampton inn and we saw here greer street and 16th have so this is 16th ave this is south korea street here we go [Music] right so we're on greer street so i reckon we're about there it's beginning [Music] um [Music] near the junction it's probably about here let's go okay good nice right that took a bit of a while let's see if i can speed this up a bit stop being such a holiday days um i think i've had this around before but do i have until i recognize it obviously can't remember where it is so that's good so underground mcdrive looks like spanish [Music] maybe qsps summit facing the unknown um see if we can that might have some good no okay no good information hotel ac porto are we in porto which is in portugal could be um see down here so could this be portuguese it could be portuguese oh it says porto again there i think we're in porto cool sorry paul's there because i thought that was maybe greek alphabet but the rest of it seems normal um okay we've got a street name here for now the magallas my pronunciations there um right what else can we use to pinpoint where we are there's a garage uh seoul it's a big old church some more road names it's a fairly big road where's the center i've been to porto but i don't recognize any of this um there's a stadium down there okay okay okay let's get this road name up here for now [Music] all right let's have a look at porto she can remember where it is there it is all right it's poor toes so put most of my time down here in the uh area i guess so straight away i see mcdonald's here so let's see if this is the road nope i don't like it shame okay so i'm going to look for a stadium that might help uh be quite a big thing to notice there's a stadium there [Music] and it looked like it was downhill [Music] um this is a big road i think that's too big though so the stadium is down this hill isn't it it's to the north ish could we be down here um it's this road there's a church but that's not it bp let's get better compass bearing on this stadium so it is else to the east to the east so we would be over here somewhere then there's mcdonald's is that the road name there's a repsol garage there's another repsol garage there's a church yes i think we're here all right let's go for it yes cool this is going all right okay another mcdonald's another city um hmm exit park okay so it looks like maybe on a motorway or [Music] some such is this the uk yeah valentine hotel and spa i know we have them in the uk doesn't mean it's just the uk though hollywood bowl that's like another uk thing i think tried on the left yes we must be in the uk so ksc's cinema franken bennies um let's see if we can get to the main road that should help us figure out where we are five five leisure park right now i gotta remember where fife is um is that in scotland i think is it in scotland or is it in wales i think it's in scotland um so let's have a quick look five so i might speed this up if it takes me a little while but i'm just gonna look for fife oh wow okay so maybe five isn't the place this is why i'm having trouble i found this sign kirk kaldi 89 a92 which is here kurt kaldi a92 this is five central retail park which is not what we're looking for is leisure park but maybe they've changed the name there's a mcdonald's there um [Music] central retail park i'm gonna put my marker here here not sure this is the right place so so i'm gonna have another look around and see if i can find fife leisure park i think it was um and i'll be back okay found fife leisure park cool here we go so here we are frankie benny's across the road where exactly did we start on the entrance uh so probably around here maybe god thank god not letting go of this perfect score i know it's taking me a while i'm sorry but it's gonna happen it's gonna happen right what we got next ah can't be in the uk again i don't think maybe australia or new zealand um so a nice kfc and a mcdonald's here let's have a look over here liquor land i don't think that's a uk thing so um you're gonna tell me anything no i need to take away that's in dollars so yeah probably southern hemisphere um all right what else can we get from here uh suzuki young motors not going to tell me where worship and community center salvation army that's a great sign b street d street um so another big road for retail big retail area um so new zealand okay we're narrowing it down uh what else can i find oh i'm maru's is that a place let's have a quick look uh i don't want to spend too long on these last two ones steampunk hq that sounds cool mcdonald's kfc opposite looks like it's this one to me so there that's the beginning i have a bp next door yes the cat's jumping around sorry about that um looking at the kfc basically won't we do you think here let's go there good good good last round perfect school this is a weird angle well we're in the states again um the hell what's going on what kind of box job camera on the car is this so there's the mcdonald's um hopefully if we move forward we'll get away from this condo all right can we zoom over there oh come on really not on the last round not like this so harrison and gilman maybe harrison avenue gilman avenue there's some casinos um i was too scared to turn around because it just wobbles oh hello taco bell oh this is a bit better okay this is more normal right what what do we got here we've got 15 and 90. city center which city i guess is there's casinos only cities that are allowed casinos is that right so we nevada and we got 15 here and it was a 90 wasn't it yeah 15 and 90. so going towards the city center which is to the north so where's the 90 them still only see the 15. reno have um sorry casinos as well is it all the whole nevada let me know in the comments if you're from america or know more about america than i do um okay let's say we are around here maybe um so the 15 was going south west i have got a brain part of how work roads work now um let's just let's just go here and see if we can find those road names my brain is obviously not engaging um can we find a mcdonald's i'm sure there's going to be a few in an out burger this is getting too central now um do we think i don't really know much about this area so um um where else could it be i'm still going on the theory that if there's casinos it has to be nearby where they're allowed casinos right this is not my greatest game is it right come on mcdonald's dunkin um feeling so confident about this now um boulder else could or where else could it be so there's still the root 15 and it goes this way never define the 90 that did we that's 80 um like 90s near it so maybe it goes on to the 90 after there's 90 up here and the 15. um so could we be here idaho boot it's a look a beaut very small very small you got a mcdonald's doesn't look like it um oh up here i'm not even trying to work this out properly am i uh okay i'm gonna probably speed this up and have a look around for some more clues try and get some bearings okay so i've seen a sign here that says believe in butte so maybe i was right where did i see pew now oh dear me here we go beaut so there's the best western there's mcdonald's there's gilmore avenue yes this is it so let's go back to the beginning this horrible rigged up car oh that's so annoying why would you do this right try and keep it straight so that is the corner here where there's the taco bell so i reckon we're about here come on perfect school ah so glad i've just taken all that time perfect score very happy happy new year and i'll see you next time let me know how you did in the comments below thanks for watching oh god ", "locations":

"hello sorry it's been a little while since i brought out a video uh life got in the way um i've moved as you can see as well um it's nearly christmas so i should have time to get some videos done and um play some games so i've chosen a guessable world for this one tears i have played this before and got a pitiful score but only five minutes so i don't know what happened to me that day but uh let's give this one a try again and see what school we can get so let's dive straight in my friend and let's go right um first thoughts of thailand but not sure has he just gone off the road there or as he parked could have gone straight off the road it's a scary looking round so look at this bin bins are quite good for information is that 1 800 is that america sendirian gerard no idea no idea okay let's go a bit further up here see okay john dropper jalan dropper guessable world hey that double hmm by hilton so there's a hotel and um not sure let's just sign up here probably beware of crazy corner oh my computer's now deciding to go slowly that's good um yeah i don't know a little rubble here does it say villa worry sam j a hmm i have not got many clues on this one myself um [Music] some flags we all know i'm great at flags so that's not gonna help me um right hmm malaysian flag could be malaysia could be malaysia right let's have a look for johor baru right i might speed this up and have a look for the whole [Music] okay i found johor baru here uh so now we just need to find raman and dak and then jalan abd i guess that's road okay ramen and deck um might have been blind like i have to speed this up again uh [Music] unless that's not what i'm looking for okay i probably will speed this up and have a good look around okay so i found doubletree so i thought oh i've seen that so i'll go and have a look at that then i saw a lot of jalan's i was like but then i realized that jalan abby abd raman and back so this is the road here so where did we start where are we outside now um so we could see hillson's right behind this building so we're probably around here at the moment so we came up this road didn't we and there was a terrifying bend that here okay let's jump back to the start oh no computer don't do this to me oh okay so went straight up here didn't we it's not too far um where was the [Music] temple so this is where we're outside now this is a road maybe here it doesn't quite add up to me but no i'm confused so that's where we were just now up here i'm sorry my computer's being really slow this is really helpful okay so came up here so i would say got to be down here somewhere and unless this is the corner crazy corner i thought we only went past one right i'm gonna put here let's go for it come on oh got the full points did we turn off okay i don't remember turning up but it worked out for the best in the end thank god so let's go on to the next one all right hopefully my computer won't conk out i can complete the game and get this video out all right okay so if that car is driving on the right um was it two-way road let's see what's down here let us see oh my computer come on oh that's as far as we can go no okay i kind of get in canada vibes but i could be making that up let's see what's down here ah so this is in korea how are we gonna guess where this is um let's just put oh i can't go any further that way either okay perfect so i think yep it's just up and down this paper um um plunkett i guess but let's see i mean there's nothing i can i can't get to this sign there's nothing i can really get from this sign here um [Music] let's see if we can match up some characters i'm not going to spend too long on this so um it'll be nice to make a fairly educated guess which characters should i concentrate on do i just plunk it in the middle hope for the best hmm i know it's not quite similar but i might go for this one [Music] oh i want to make a better educated guest than this but as usual i am feeling the pressure that somebody's watching so let's plunk it there it's the middle anyway come on computer okay only 75 miles were they the characters in the yellow maybe but still as usual i will take that i mean it's quite a good score for career and not knowing anything about the language so that's all i'm saying oh no this could just be because my computer is obviously not running well thank god it's loading ah this is frustrating isn't it let's see if i can get anything while it's trying to load there's a lot of blurring but i don't know if it is germany driving on the left so could this be south africa or somewhere else in asia is it thailand they drive on the left as well and they do in japan see what language that is um feels down here [Music] that's blurry as well um let's just zoom down this road a bit see what we can see oh long road right maybe i'll go the other way i went that one did i go that way did i go that way i went that way right let's go this way shane that's blood i wonder what is blurred out there all right zoom down the road less signs here right 75 okay damp looks kind of tropical i don't know ah my computer is really struggling i don't know if you can hear the fan hopefully i've got rid of that in post but looks like the move wasn't happy for the computer let's see what this sign says come on you can do it like nancy [Music] recreational area so could this be new zealand australia where's the sun where's the sun hidden got any shadows at all no [Music] hmm i might dive in with new zealand and lake yancey there's quite a few lakes and parks and things so i'm gonna have a quick look around here see what i can find [Music] okay i can't find that lake i just looked in tasmania as well um and my computer not loading stuff properly is annoying me so a blank computer like a good user um i remember seeing something about green in the first sign that we saw but i can't see any lakes around here either probably not except but i have to choose somewhere to go so check that link so she says so we're going to go with ah make a decision i'm gonna go here i don't know not sure where else to put it let's see let's see where we were okay good so it was new zealand um up here okay so i haven't got the name that i saw on that sign and that's using right in yeah okay fair enough i'll take that i didn't bother zooming right in to the map and again not too bad on points all right i'm loving it let's go see if my computer can hold out just two more rounds okay this is a nice gorge would that be the word probably not that's more of a drop isn't it initial thoughts wouldn't like to call it i would call it wrong anyway um so let's pop down here i think there's a sign in the distance see come on i'm really sorry this is probably not fun for you guys to see my computer struggling to load can we get to this sign up here good you can do it oh come on [Music] okay is that like a village somebody's house maybe a farmer's house no don't go backwards no i want to see the sign please all right okay so it's got nothing on it really um i can't make that out right so what am i gonna go on here um i can't really tell that sun is over there here or no i'm not going to take a guess on that maybe i'll just pop the other way this is supposed to be a guessable world so wherever you guessed i have no thoughts about where this could be at the moment i mean probably maybe somewhere south of america which i don't know very well could be new zealand again it could be australia could be somewhere in africa um yellow plates i don't know what that could mean this sign here because there's anything that's hmm i think suddenly had chili coming to my head so maybe i'll go somewhere in chile um um yeah why not let's go chilling although chip is quite long and thin um is it all mountainous pretty much mostly down here i think that looks a bit so i might go somewhere around here yeah let's go on this road here let's see a great random guess all completely wrong come on right well that really whacked me on point isn't it so it's in colombia where were we uh middle of nowhere middle of nowhere don't know how that was guessable let me know in the comments below if there's something i missed or i could have picked up one i'm not really sure on that one all right last round i'm sure the computer can struggle on for this last one come on right okay we're civilization so that's a good start and [Music] it reminds me of holland but i'm not going to call that just yet let's see if we can find some language or see anything at all would be nice thank you some long words there does that look like a little circle on top there it's maybe somewhere in scandinavia um creep this way check out some bins number plate so it looks like this new eu badge on there now look around while i'm trying to remember which one of the scandi countries isn't in the eu i think it's norway but not sure okay this is [Music] um so double dots on the a still thinking scandinavia i might come back to that school in a minute a big old army truck in there i am getting really filled up with this computer and i bet you are too looks like a big road down here let's get down here let's see if we can see this sign because that's probably a street name [Music] that is probably a street sign road name oh i promise i'll have this sorted before i film again my obligatory christmas map and slayer right so that is definitely a road name but still can't say for sure what language that possibly could be gran thinks garden i should go down here don't get annoyed by the computer persevere because there's a nice juicy sign here right 101 road that looks like it's a small road though key harding road okay i'm gonna go with this information pop that in the corner and have a little look around here yeah i think it's norway that's not in the e all right i'm gonna have a look around and i'll be back in a minute [Music] okay i can't find any road 101 um so [Music] i might just plunk it um i'm probably in the wrong country and i'm leaning towards sweden i don't know why it's probably finland until i go finland all right let's go finland are you ready for an insane guess could this be the one probably not so let's go ah [Music] let's go here yes let's do it come on and sing us 191 miles correct country is in helsinki i just thought about ring road oh look there we go [Music] never mind never mind let's see how we did overall it's not not great but better than my previous school so i'm quite happy with that how did you do let me know in the comments below i promise i will get the computer fixed so this will be a lot smoother next time which will be a christmas map of some sort i'll try and find one or maybe i'll just do christmas island or something like that until then stay safe bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 1.467248183095358, "lng": 103.75827419176528}, {"round": 2, "lat": 37.49568392018286, "lng": 128.14655314594006}, {"round": 3, "lat":

welcome back um i thought it was time to revisit the 198 capitals of the world the map i did on my very first video um i didn't get 25 000 points on my first video i got 15 829 so i'd like to get a perfect score on this map on camera not sure if that's gonna happen but we can give it a try um i believe my husband was playing with me when we got this perfect score so it's definitely not me i'm sure i didn't do it by myself so let's give this a go take you along with me hopefully you can get perfect score too that's the same settings from the last game so i am not limiting myself on the rounds on this game and uh let's invite you all and give this one a go right okay everything's in english are you gonna give me anything no let's move down here a bit [Music] hmm euro panel beaters interesting what do you say ah swaziland okay so we're in south africa right that was an old name for a place isn't it um so this one here we go now eswetini uh okay let's pop this there a minute so euro panel beaters p.o box tanks no street name what else we got around here is it all car type things um a lot of it is blurred out capital motor corporation air conditioning can't read you this sign say met swazi cash and carry okay so it looks like it might be on the outskirts want to splash distributors so this must be old footage i haven't changed updated their signs so um [Music] the euro panel beaters wasn't it treated timber [Music] done shopping oh where could we be how far zoomed in do we need to be to see those kind of businesses um there's motors place could we be around here station i might speed this up so i'm going to look for these businesses which might not even be listed on the map but i've got to give it a try what else am i going to look for [Music] lovely okay now i'm going to speed it up looking for those [Music] okay i found lips ember street i've also found smart panel beaters so i wonder if that's the same company now called a different name maybe there's another one there there's okay maybe not uh sorry if you can hear my cat snoring as well by the way right so where's columbus there's kalonga street so we came down here and i think we probably came from up here um i'd like to get a perfect school so i'm going to have to go back and i on myself so down here and then slow down here then straight on right yeah straight on and then ship straight up from here so straight over there i think that is around the bend [Music] refrigeration and air conditioning i think that was on there wasn't it not oh yeah there's the refrigeration and air conditioning and game on did we see that and here there's game on where did we start was this here did we start here yes we did okay so i think we might be here come on oh 17 yards perfect score though so that'll do right that's only for round one right round two you could do anything in a [Music] and a royal north look okay i can't read don't know what that is but you can do anything in it all right so official coverage and a place where they vape wilson bay is dollars so i'm driving on the left so it could be australia or new zealand or south africa um i have an australian new zealand vibe i don't think they have dollars in south africa's rand isn't it they have dollars in australia and new zealand so how do we work out which one we are in and can i remember the capitals of each one says wellington the capital of new zealand not sure and canberra is a capital of australia i believe are you gonna give me any clues oh lotto new zealand okay so let's test me out on here uh wellington good what did i say i can't remember now uh maybe i should be a bit more awake to do this right hotel bristol so we seem to be in an area a lot of references to bristol i thought i saw bristol something else as well um did we see a street name right there right well done me right in front of you so probably quite central so shops around here anything to relate into bristol um oh there's gooseney street okay and [Music] i saw a sign for cuba let's go back to beginning so that's 24 hour shot we started outside looks like an old theater that's closed customs milk crate vape glass let's have a look customs milk crate car park uh so we're more outside of customs let's pop this there cool three yards not bad next okay strange picture right oh no oh no we can't even move anywhere come on signs copper pop gym and spa ow no why why is this in here can you give me more information um can we trust a compass can we even see where the sun is probably over there there's a couple's gone right i guess it's just that one now uh that's to the north west so could we be in the southern hemisphere is the compass accurate yeah what is this oh cool regime game i can turn it on good right so yeah all right let's say we're in the southern [Music] hemisphere that gives us quite a lot to choose from ah [Music] how are we gonna figure this out so a lot of english but that might be just because it's a resort maybe the cop something um so copper pot okay i have no idea about any of these countries okay i might speed this up we're gonna have a look at every single capital and see if i can find somewhere called copper pot i mean you never know is that a stupid idea probably um yeah i think i'm going to give that a go and where is the equator line right let me start with rwanda [Music] okay no luck with that i'm going to have to give up a perfect score this place is a place that has official coverage and this is the photo sphere that they chose i think that's wholly unfair very unfair but if it's the only one they could find in the city then that's fair enough but man i do not know what else to go on here um you couldn't necessarily go with the fauna because that could be just put in for this resort um i have no ideas no ideas whatsoever so the question then is where am i going to plonk it i'm just looking at these flower beds is that the jamaican flag or am i just making things up now uh let's have a quick look but i'm going by the compass being right it shouldn't be here i don't think it's there i don't think it's even called copper pot so i don't even know what else we can go on ah okay i'm gonna stick with it being in the southern hemisphere so you have some more um so i am [Music] going to go with zambia because it's fairly central hopefully i'm not too far away from wherever it is and is there a spa that i can at least put it near lots of hotels up here and lodges and things oh i really don't want to plonk it but i don't know what else to do um have you done for this one what did you find to try and find it or did you not and where did you decide to plunk it all right all right all right just plunk it punk it yep i will i will just do it here all right let's see where we were no okay not too far away so we were in [Music] i did look in malawi and we were at the crossroads apparently copperport indian restaurant oh well oh well didn't get too well i'll take the point because it could have been a lot further away and i don't think that's so bad like the next door-ish country but no perfect score okay i can at all try and beat my previous score so let's see um okay this is another photo sphere so we've got dhl in somewhere it's so blurry so blurry something universalists [Music] don't know what language that can be bff pf uh does not go well is it guys glad i didn't set a time limit for this one bff um again i just have no [Music] no ideas no ideas uh bf the kinner facile is that a country could be run by somebody else because it doesn't seem to be a place for the dot to denote a capital [Music] hmm ah where else could it be [Music] anything else maybe this is french i want to go with this place but i don't know which city and i think these are all un recognized capitals so it's probably not this place at all i'm gonna go here let's see there's a dhl place here what else can i do um [Music] it looks pretty french again [Music] any dhl a few universities around here though um [Music] i'm going to plunk it here because again i just have no clue i don't know what else to do this is getting boring you and for me uh it doesn't bode well for [Music] beating my previous school let's pop it here and let's see where we were oh okay so it was the right country i just didn't see that having a dot in it ah darn i should just have a look at more countries and more cities in this country okay there's the dhl done never mind never mind right country so i'll take that i'll take that see got the right country okay all right we're on last round okay oh cool another photo so indoors doing a cooking show yeah filming a cooking show but looks of it right two flags that i feel i should recognize why is there two flags here ah that reminds me the puerto rican flag i think ah let's just give up playing this map i'm good right so it reminds me of the puerto rico flag doesn't mean it is why is there a flag there that reminds me of the middle east this kind of looks like like morocco or something hmm i'm probably gonna kick myself again on this one it's definitely not the moroccan flag because that's a weird star what about libya it's not tunisia the tunisian flag doesn't have green on it what about libya let's give it a go i'm not going to spend too much time because again i have no information i do not have good enough knowledge of flags uh sun try going by the sun again so northern hemisphere i'm going i'm going with this i'm going with tripoli um and let's find a nice historical place um let's go with is that a walled square that's probably not that place tripoli castle let's do it let's go there okay so again not huge far away didn't even think of algeria that's quite obvious now now i know of course where were we we're in a museum of some sort by look at it ah done over in points all right how did we do okay so beat my last call so i am happy with that i'm gonna run with it keep smiling [Music] how did you guys do i mean we got a lot of african countries obviously when new zealand one was the best ah maybe next time who knows would you like me to see see me try again is it not an easy map not an easy map all right well thanks for watching let me know how you did and i'll see you next time bye you ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat":

welcome back uh today is another geogra another play-along and i thought we'll do the classic i saw the sign um i haven't done this on film yet last time i played it not quite a perfect score and it took me over an hour so let's see if we can do any better this time with the added pressure of being recorded so let's give this go make this a challenge the link will be in the description box below if you want to play along let's see what we get all right king's val kittens velvet bleak maybe so i'm getting maybe scandinavia vibes possibly um oh it's beautiful look at that okay so that looks like hmm it's gonna say norway but not sure now um okay so i think these road numbers are probably our best bets it's definitely a coastal place maybe it's not where i think it is see this looks like a different country that i can't think of the name of right now which is really handy let's have a quick look at the map and see if we can find number 13 road so my first thought was scandinavia let's have a quick look yeah so these have got e's and stuff in front of them oh note some of them don't that one's just got a four so so do we troll through the map trying to find number 13. um i think yes i think it's the only thing i've got to go on so i will probably end up speeding this up but i'm gonna have a quick scan around looks like i have to be a bit more zoomed in to see those numbers so these are all blue here in sweden so maybe my thought first of all is correct oh there's number 13 here so where is it pointed to vos there's oda ah where's voss you'd think it would be close by maybe it's short for rossvarden okay well we found the road found the two possibly the other name let's pop pointer here a minute so what was the name of this place king's kinsavik kinzarvik let's see i guess kenzarvik on a point so i'm going to scan up oh here we go kim zark okay and we're outside what are we outside tourist information yes looks like tourist information is that on the map here um not on first glance are there spa there's a hotel spa bank um [Music] i didn't notice a church that's a spa shop let's have a look here so spa tourist information our house i guess foodie wagon we're going down to what looks like a port so i guess that's this here so i think we are probably around here right in front of the turning yes let's put ourselves here let's see okay happy with that i think the marker is probably a little bit our place but 5000 points good let's try the next one where's the sign is it lan i guess it could be lanion uh what else we got around here so does that mean south front boost am i just confusing that with other languages lots of signs here though anything that i recognize no nothing so um [Music] my first thought south front so we should probably stick with that because i've learnt in the past to listen to my first thought and if it's wrong i have tried let's see trey grier is that a place uh shall we try and see if there is another sign like these down here might help just a quick look uh more lao is that could that be industrial airport okay i'm gonna put that in the corner there uh no road numbers by the looks of it which really helped us in the first round tourist office doesn't say of where okay i'm gonna pop that in the corner and i'm gonna have a look at the map so i still think south of france um i presume more lay or however you pronounce that is a place maybe these others are places as well um so can't see anything on a quick look on this zoom now so i might again this might get sped up um and i'll have a look around for these places on there um more lakes i'll put the x on the end so i remember um do you think it's on the coast it didn't look like coast to me but it doesn't mean it isn't and that's if it even is out of france so nothing on quick scan uh okay i will definitely speed this up i'm gonna have a good old scour if i can [Music] okay i can't find anything with more lay as the name so luck is not on my side this time um i'm gonna have quick look see if there's anything else i can find that could possibly point to where we are um it might be such a small place that i have to zoom in too much to see and therefore i need to know pinpoint the area a bit more so let's have a look over here oh that went fast uh maybe that's a river oh there's a big sign [Music] that's the train station um [Music] i don't know that's anything that i recognize so little ligri does that mean river is at the name of the river and are we even in south france this one is that the name of the river a lot um another quick scan around for this river name shall we just a quick one no i'm just looking for ones that jump out at me i know it's probably not the best way to do it okay i'm gonna have a quick hop over here see if these signs go this way please either this side give us anything [Music] um so i'm more like [Music] nothing new i don't think blurry this picture let's pop over here [Music] it's another airport i'm not too big on airports around france um nothing that i can pick up on [Music] what's this i feel like i'm missing something or i should know one of these names but uh i don't one sureless is that a big place and i'm just not seeing it okay i might have one more look around [Music] montreal here but i don't think that's the same one is it uh i have a feeling this is such a small place it's going to be to zoom in quite far to see it another montreal there oh thanks france right um i think i'm going to end up plunking it you know tan that's not the name that we saw for the river was it um i'm still drawn to this area so why don't we plunk it in this area i think i'm so resistant to this i'd like to actually find it but it's taking too long um and i still don't know for sure that it's in this area there's a bit of a well goose hunt no i'm gonna have to plunk it let's plunk it here and mount to barn um probably a bigger place than we're actually in it's got a river there's that tan river let's go let's go here yeah let's do that let's see maybe it'll be an insane guess of course it's not oh god it's right over here all right so west of france and a place called lan la neon we did see that at the beginning didn't we so where's this other place that i was looking for i can't see it oh well don't mind good start oh there it is up more lay okay good start paul middle let's see what we get next right hanger rad house so we scandinavia again um see anything there some lovely mountains is don't know what that means let's have a look at this shop up here and some lovely houses up there so there's a train first of all this looks like some houses on stilts is that a road number what else you got here extra something narvesen nothing i recognize and that blurred out and let's see this is a road number possibly but it's a very small road so um so which scandinavian country do we think this is or is it could it be austria let's have a quick look um at the road numbers so these ones is what i think the 53 is there's a 51. um will we quickly happen upon road number 53 probably not i do not seem to be having that luck today let's follow the 51 see if it takes us somewhere and i think it is around here so i'm sure it's sweden um so let's check in finland now i think we might be norway again either that or we could be in denmark but i don't think you get those kind of mountains in denmark i don't think so um your road numbers seem to be a bit bigger that hold my theory up yep let's go is that my uh very stringy theory i am going to go with norway so i am gonna have a look around for road number 53. um now 55. god that was glad i checked that uh let's go back to the beginning and is that the name of the town so look around for road number 55 and i will be back in a minute [Music] okay that didn't take too long i found row 55 and i found a place called hoyanger so i can only presume we are here now where did we start so younger house um are you on the map go on be on the map next to a shop what was that shop called pop up here again yeah extra 723 or something like that so this must be the place so is this that come here um what else is here post office that post office maybe el poston i think i think this is it i hope this is a that's hoyanger this little house that'll be their little house so i think we might be um that's a road it must be that road there leaving the map like i can see look something or something gate yep yes yes yes yes right uh we're just for the corner probably here let's see cool okay well seems like norway is my friend today let's hope we get another norway round let's see ah okay maybe austria this time i think uh sorry i thought the sign what sign did we stay on van gui so got to presume that's the name of the town and i have austrian vibes from this let's have a quick look here so zurich okay maybe not just going through her head is a wreck in austria or in germany i think it's austria right um okay so that's on the road seven to get to zurich saint garland the other way so zurich is to the south west and let's put back to the beginning for the town name vangee all right so where am i going uh so switzerland not austria oh my god what am i doing um so are we in switzerland or are we in germany there's a road seven wasn't it that said it was going towards zurich i don't see a seven let's see road seven and that was going south west so somewhere up here maybe we'll find oh there's seven here and we're looking for banky thank you so i'm gonna have a quick look all along the row seven [Music] for a place called vangi and that's where the seven stops so hmm i cannot see it here so again i will probably speed this up i'm going to find vangee i'll see you in a minute [Music] okay i checked the road sign again i was looking at the wrong number and it's this blue one not the red one so i'm glad i checked that because i have found van gi so we were by the station i believe so pop us there a minute i think this is a roundabout we're looking at right now there's a little river down there i think so this is a station this is the roundabout i'm pretty happy i think we are here well let's go cool thank god france france ruining my school right last round of course is not gonna be so easy right what we got on our sign uh beckmann electric uh karang sun nadiya and phil's i think that's the place or is it this quin i cannot pronounce these um so does it look kind of french i think it is they are not our friends right um what else can i get so not every country in africa has coverage and this is official coverage um it looks kind of french so that would be the name of the place again senegal i think has french looks kind of french right kind of um there are some other places i believe cote d'ivoire i would pronounce that i speak french maybe hmm not my strong point a lot more comfortable with europe obviously because i live here right so it's got to be something on this sign should point us to where we are quinn callery toba okay let me have a look through cynical and see if there's something i can pick here because limited knowledge this is the only place i can think of so i'm gonna have a quick look through um and i will be back [Music] okay i found a place called tauba and here we have taoba i don't know if that is related if this is the right place um i also found this place tauber fowl because i thought maybe talbot tafe is a name i have absolutely no idea so i am going to plonk it and hope for a completely insane guess um where to plonk it though i was hoping there might be like an area because it's quite a big place they might have one of these other names um i don't know if we're gonna be that lucky though you might be that lucky let me know in the comments if you know which of these on the sign is what we should be looking for and i've just picked up on the completely wrong thing which i guess i'll find out in a minute anyway um let's see where shall i pop it so i go central and i don't think there's anything let's pop it there a minute it's going to stand out specifically on the map very nice straight road maybe fairly north south road let's find a nice long northeast ish i don't think it's that one i'm not sure in the right place so um [Music] let's pick this road and let's go in the middle of it and that road looks good now let's go this one see insane guess maybe maybe oh well we've got badge that's cool but uh very far away damn it so no no insane guests but the right country so i know i'm quite happy with that it was karang we're looking for ah never mind omega rabbit that's quite cool then but not bad on points i mean yeah i'll take it it's okay i still blame france two bad rounds have links with france let's see how it is so 22 764. it's okay let's look at this one here ah never mind maybe i need to brush up with my french well let me know how you did in the comments below were you shouting at me saying this is obviously this place how do you not know what that means why are you even doing this let me know in the comments leave me a like subscribe all of that stuff because that helps to motivate me to make more i'll probably will anyway because i quite enjoy doing it have a good weekend and i'll see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 60.37562961427193, "lng": 6.719401197195137},

welcome back i'm gonna do another map another play along um i found this fun with flags map which i thought sounded interesting and not great with flags and and by the looks of it it's quite hard to get a high score on this one so uh let's see how well we do i'm going to be happy if i can at least get the right country probably not going to be able to pinpoint it exactly on the map but the right country will do so let's get into this game make a challenge copy the link link will be in the description box below so you can play along and uh let's start all right okay so korea jeju national museum so in a place called jeju so this is unofficial coverage which means we can't move about so see if we can find any other signs might help with the town or city name i'm gonna have to just go with jeju i think all right let's get into the map ah it's the island jeju right so that was fairly easy well i haven't found a museum yet um what is the symbol for museums symbols are slightly different on this map really small oh this might take a little while if it does i'll speed it up [Music] do i think i might have to plonk it not sure i'm gonna find exactly where it is or the right symbol for museums just looking out of town because it looks like there's buses going there um yeah i'm not sure no i'm not sure so i am going to plong uh actually let's leave it where it is now put it here and uh is it gonna be more in town no i'm gonna leave it there and let's see let's have a look okay so it was a little bit out of town i can't even see a marker for it oh so that's not helpful okay well not bad on points happy with that let's see what we get next ah football right this flag oh i don't know that flag i don't know the stadium um [Music] so this is the person that took the photo i have to presume it's an arabic country well this must be the main flag hmm i really don't know bugger okay how else can we work this out um is there so many people on the pitch uh are these adverts gonna give us anything probably not oh my god what are they doing up there oh it's scary um [Music] the flag again oh i wish i knew this flag okay what country could it be i don't think trying to think what the flags look like so i think saudi flag is different and that dubai and qatar is different um oh no i um [Music] have no thoughts about your thoughts on this one uh all right so nice hills um [Music] looks like those are more mountains and not the sea which was hoping for mountainous it's all pretty mountainous um [Music] do i know what the iranian flag looks like i don't think i think it is hmm what else can we go with no idea what the yemen flag looks like quite no i think i might pop it in ah i get close but i have absolutely no clue right so i'm just gonna have to pick a place i want to pick iran i don't know why and find some mountains isn't i guess there is a city around it doesn't look like that where are some mountains a lot of mountains a lot of mountains um i want to still make a fairly educated guess if you've got a stadium this place might be too small for a stadium um anywhere else i'm gonna have a quick scan around you never know might come up with something um but i'll speed it up [Music] okay i haven't seen a single stadium but i probably haven't been zoomed in enough to see it but i might go this looks like a fairly big place maybe somewhere here i'm a bit annoyed i can't find it but without knowing that flag there is no way i very much doubt i'm in the right country but let's give it a go let's drop it here let's see all right in yemen good yeah i can't even see it on the map there okay hopefully now i will remember what the yemen flag looks like i very much doubt it okay 995 points let's move swiftly on um right ah another flag i don't know more unofficial coverage um very blurry so i don't know what we're supposed to get from here um gosh so i think it's south asian [Music] um it's not the thai flag don't think it's cambodia or vietnam not sure what laos flag looks like i don't think it's bangladesh for india or pakistan [Music] um i don't know what bhutan's looks like i don't think it's any of these countries hmm so i just go laos because i can't think what their flag looks like myanmar i think i might recognize myanmar's flag but again i'm not sure hey there's definitely nothing else we can see here is there not really i can't see any language not at all hey okay i think might go laos don't know why i have nothing else to go on um just put it in this place i think why not there let's see is it the right country oh two more let's see let's don't even know how you pronounce that my god right it's pretty bad pretty bad did you know that flag i hope you did because otherwise 180 points i really hope you're beating me guys this is a terrible game right uh i kind of recognize this flag but i couldn't tell you straight off the bat what it is what we got going on here then rain university um [Music] all these rounds are really painful anything else [Music] okay i'm gonna have a look through the map and see if i can find that city um i mean am i just thinking around again because tyrone it sounds a bit the same oh this is terrible right i'm gonna have a quick look around and see if i can find it [Music] okay i can't find anywhere called naren i've probably missed it i feel a bit disheartened now this is not going well at all but i am going to pop it around again because i can't think of where else and it's fairly central to all these countries so i'm going to do it really zoomed out and i'll pop it here see what happens okay is in iraq okay not too bad so that's the university oh no nah harain university oh well there's not a place never mind didn't get too butchered on points that time um i'm learning some new flags this is good please be a european round or something next and the european one that i know no okay i should not have picked this map today wow um [Music] again i know i've seen this flag oh is that pakistan i'm not sure um i suppose this looks like a a mine or something maybe not really sure again unofficial coverage can't move anywhere no other signs to go on can't see any writing [Music] um this is going to be very hard to pinpoint anyway is it pakistan why do i think that that's the first thing that came to my head doesn't mean it's right at all um it's not the turkey fan it's not tunisia [Music] i don't think we'll be able to see any mines on here so first thing that came into my head was pakistan so i'm going to stick with that pop it in some mountains on a road would be good just outside this town yeah here no idea otherwise okay yes okay so i've got the right country thank god thank god okay right country pretty much the other end of it kind of so okay that's the right country yes oh that was the last round okay thank god really because it's not going well was it right so what did i get 11 699 what a wonderful school did you know some of these flags because quite clearly i need to do some more studying and flags uh let me know what school you got in the comments below please like the video because that helps me know that you like what i'm doing also it helps youtube to suggest my content to other people so they can enjoy watching me completely fail to work out what flag is where thanks very much for watching i'll see you

"hello welcome back doing another play along um this time i wanted to do capitals i thought i'll try something else out of my comfort zone which is uh usa state capitals don't know a lot about the us so i figured this would be pretty interesting it says it's easy but um i'm not sure that's the case for someone who doesn't even know where the states are or anything like that so let's give this one a go set it as a challenge copy the link the link will be in the description box below if you want to play along and uh let's go right we've got here nails by barbie interesting um water street state street which state liberty mutual insurance okay uh we've got some highway numbers so capital mini mart okay so is it capital because it's a place or this is the capital all right i think we're gonna have to move a bit so let's it's like a big sign over there so let's have a look at that one walgreens so water fill rockland and belfast and we've got some root numbers so let's try and look for these root numbers i got an idea of what state or which area [Music] no i don't don't know [Music] okay let's have a look for these numbers let's pop that in the corner there so 201 and the 202. um i don't think these go in any order for numbering either and it looks like yeah so these roads are pretty small ones you have to be zoomed in to see uh might need to get a bit more information i think unless we see waterville rockland or belfast on a quick scan uh if this takes a while i will speed it up but hopefully i'll just suddenly happen upon 201 or 2i2 and everything will be wonderful [Music] okay i can't find those rows and a quick scrub through the map so i'm gonna look around for a bit more information [Music] um main street maine maine i don't think i went that far lane's up here somewhere right main here we go so is it portland is that the state capital um oh there's a oh this word lighthouse gosh right is there anything in that we spotted there's a walgreens wasn't there i presume it's um fairly central um this said that's chandler street main street maine so main street or chanda street are we even in portland [Music] now wondering if this is the right place so we've there's a different capital okay let's go back to the beginning didn't check the highways did we so that's one uh 302 can't see 202 or 201 oh there's 202 okay okay um i'm really questioning whether it is portland it might not be the biggest city or town in that state that is the capital so there's a 201 there's a 202 now can we find bell fast was it and says belfast okay okay i can do this couldn't do this so that's going historic riverfront it's got to be portland dental practice let's go back to portland oh it's a riverfront there this is not a river is it ah so belfast camden rock something as well let's try over here so to winthrop on the interstate 95 [Music] what do you say here historic riverfront old fort western convent river trail i saw a fort didn't i fought halifax old fort western so do we think it's somewhere else along this river [Music] okay i found a place with old fort weston so this has got to be the place what is your name augusta augusta very small looking place okay so let's find out where we were here we go big roundabout this has got to be the place right and which road are we on so that says pow hatton powhatan street here we go um so we must be around here somewhere so we're just at that road junction yeah so probably here all right let's go for it wow that took such a long time i hope the rest don't take so long let's see what we got next ah another small place maybe um paul's church episcopal okay this is a nice old buildings here no sign out the front can we see that one down there do you think new hampshire's presidential primary and new hampshire is held blah blah blah so is new hampshire a place or is it estate that's how much i don't know america right new hampshire i don't think it is a state um oh it is a state okay that told me so again i think we're going to play the game which is the state capital is it manchester that'd be weird put my pin here a minute because i don't want to lose the state okay you're gonna give me any more information maybe no okay right not spend so long trying to guess what the capital is and see if i can find [Music] an actual name somewhere here looks like we started on park street so we have share historical society another old buildings probably the state flag what are you building oh that sign disappear so look oh that sign is gone uh bus no they've all got like capital street so does every capital have a capital street with an o it's very strange um come on give me a sign give me a sign church new hampshire i know we're in new hampshire i know we are but what is your capital am i gonna have to take a guess i am just flinging myself around now without really knowing where i am where i'm going concorde so a place called concord yes there is all right let's try this okay i think we're on park street [Music] i can't see it so find that street sign again did we go this way we didn't go this way let's have a look down here uh street signs ah state capital right capitol do you is that how they spell it in america i don't understand it is park street downtown concord if you've heard me i've gone this way first of all all right so downtown means central central right in america so there's a state capital building you'd think that would be noted on here somewhere so let's zoom back out a bit i presume this is downtown state house capitol street here we go park street there's that church so i can wear around here let's go oh one yard good all right please be something that easier suffolk university okay so in the us is suffolk a place or is it it's not a state is it is this boston common do we in boston that's a state it's called the state capital isn't it boston should i look for something else or should i look for boston common in boston it looks like quite a big city let's just have a quick look at this west street uh okay let's have a look in boston it's over here somewhere where there it is boston and how's boston coming okay this looks much better um what do you see west street park street beacon streets uh there's less street the road going off of it have a look that'd be easy idea suffolk university is probably marked on the map somewhere let's just see trim something something uh no no okay german street so where was west street or suffolk university there's west street um [Music] can't see suffolk university on here though so we're a bit further down here though won't we pop a pin there go back to the beginning h r block see that's on the map can we see a statue in the park no hmr block you on it oh here we go h r block so we're probably about there maybe a bit further up here okay give that a go oh five yards all right not bad next one okay leia's law firm very strange mix of buildings charter oak health center islamic academy oh doesn't say charlotte wrote a name of a place [Music] center of heartford now hartford must be a towel maybe what states are we in anything on here glastonbury we in the uk [Music] so maybe down here hartford health department [Music] anything this way hungerford street okay so about this church nope so where do we think probably north ish children by the trees um minneapolis is probably the capital of minnesota well wisconsin is probably milwaukee madison michigan is probably detroit but again again you've been shown that that's not necessarily the case um i think i really need to find a state so come on [Music] yes state of connecticut right [Music] that's up here somewhere isn't it [Music] all right this here hartford there you are god right now i remember seeing a road sign but i can't remember what that was i must have been walking down main street right that makes sense uh so let's have a look where we started so we were on do we have a road name nope see is it the end of this street wonderful i'm sure we saw right now oh here we go grand street grand street capital avenue i'll probably speed this up just to try and shorten up the video so looking for grand street [Music] back down broad street and grand street so we were on [Music] grand street when it's pointing that way that means it's that's the road right so we were [Music] one up so not this road charter oak hill center uh can we see oh here we go to oak family health center 32 grand street all right so we carry on up a bit more that's charter oak health center maybe that's that one oh yes say yes law firm we saw that didn't we just beginning that was that here we go let's do it it's taking long enough six yards okay last round better be a nice quick simple round please looks like a nice canal all right lisa's consignment i hope i picked the right direction to start going in so river street i guess this is some chinese oh that looks like a volcano are we on the islands um interesting it's like barbers queer apartments concord i wonder where in hawaii or somewhere like that maybe um hmm very interesting now they are down here somewhere and i presume honolulu is the capital do you have a river going through you nice looking community park do you think this could be it likes it says and hotel river street um but i'm liking it i think maybe we are around here here you go river street uh yes i reckon this is probably that bridge because we've got this over there possibly and can we see that park oh here's that park okay okay okay okay yep and hotel street right where did we start come on last round actually not bad so n powell high in powell high here we go n power high street this is consignment secondhand store which is what we're on the corner of lovely here come on yes does that mean that's a perfect score i didn't check let's see oh my god yes amazing amazing look at all that all up in that area and just that one down there in hawaii wow that's amazing shame it took so long but we got there in the end how did you do are you american so would you you know had a bit of help knowing the country knowing these strange capital cities let me know how you did in the comments below thank you very much for watching i'll see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 44.30983827509878, "lng": -69.77971819624508},

welcome back here to another play along so after the high of finally getting perfect school i'll bring myself promptly back down to earth and try a geo better world which i've not got too bad score on before um but we'll see if now i'm better perhaps or even just the same or worse so let's get into this let's give it a try so make it a challenge and the link to play along will be in the description box below and let's start the game right um thinking well america canada or australia or new zealand i guess i don't see these hydrants anywhere else and which way do we go to get some information do we think maybe this way um [Music] so can we see the sun [Music] maybe over there but i don't know that's gonna help that nope so not sure what hemisphere we're in so we're on first avenue north west those look like more american i guess you would expect to see an american flag by now [Music] driving on the right i think we're in the us uh let's see what the sign gives us us border a cindy so is that the border with mexico or with canada let's have a look a coattrail does that i don't know clutching at straws here all right so i'll see if maybe these roads signed numbers give me anything and i'll have a look around maybe the canada border do i think yes i'll look around the canada order so let's see let's put these where i can see them 1335 i don't know would that be these numbers oh look here we go there's some blue ones okay so we're in canada i think so there's 35 i'll put my pin here a minute um and thirteen [Music] can't see thirteen though there's thirteen okay so straight on for the 13 or left and right for the 35 so could we be here all right this is looking good because first avenue northwest or something wasn't it room francis see if we can find francis um um [Music] so to the west and francis was to the north oh there's francis okay i really think we are here somewhere in where you burn so now we want to find first avenue what's that is this two street does that mean first what was that one street i don't understand well there's 7-eleven this is giving me hope is that also bp i don't know so where did we come from we were from this way it's back to the east so this way my red coat trail okay this is seeming good we came out these streets so i think go back to the beginning and see where we were can we get a road name from here let's go this way around the bend okay so one on this side [Music] i filled i feel caught and that says first avenue northeast so let's try and find high field i feel crescent i think that's probably it so we're in the middle let's go with that oh good good start right see what we have next another suburb maybe in a different continent maybe this one is australia let me give a look yes so this is australia now we just need to work out what town or city oops need to double click there let's go back here a bit so mckay street retford build is that the name of the place or just name the guy house raise custom builds lovely right um [Music] does this give us any information where'd that go okay can that tell us i reckon that might have a city name on it or something are we gonna be able to see it at all i don't think so oh definitely says something city i don't know australia well enough to work that out from the length of the name [Music] so i'm going to try and find some more information i'm going to go this way shooting past everything hopefully i'm not shooting past something with information on it can i go on this main road please no okay okay um maybe this old sign can you give me something give me some of them property center har courts nope oh about bins bins oh all right there's a park there bins usually has the name of the city on them is it brisbane then i love bne that be brisbane let's see what this park is called trundle park see trundle park brisbane city okay excellent brisbane whoop up here right brisbane is big so i am probably going to speed this up and look for trundle park i don't know where in the city that might be i'll see you in a minute [Music] all right found trundle park there is a lot of parks in brisbane we all have a name but we found trundle park now can i remember the name of the road no i can't so let's go back to the beginning and there was a road sign down here wasn't there smeaton street smeaton street here we are 27 to seven [Music] handily the uh houses are numbered on the map so where were we outside of number 11. so here we go number 11. pop is there let's see a little bit further down but good that's not bad another five thousand points right let's see what we get next all right phrase restaurant uh are we in venice i think we might be in venice i don't think i've ever had a round in venice before like maybe once maybe once is that a [Music] street sign do they have canal [Music] names and street names oh god nice so ponte di [Music] and what church is this so let's just jump in i guess it's on the main island that's what you call it here so the s polo says there's quite a few i would have thought well that one's apollo let's just pop a marker there for a minute so we don't lose that one any others look like it so oops could it be this one a little bridge over there so what was the street name we saw ponti di fari let's punt there is that the name of the bridge though maybe maybe going mad today right i'm not sure is this one um because i think the bridge would be called that name i saw up here which was [Music] anything else i can see here i already see what kind of shape this building is can we see this sign over here ah let it go not really let's go up the steps a bit here let's say [Music] giovanni evangelista let me see that around here don't think so [Music] okay so something paulo and ponti di ferrari i'm gonna have a look around i'll see you in a bit [Music] well i do not like venice she don't like venice so i found here punt rio de ferrari ponte ferrari [Music] is this it oh that says ferrari but i am so fed up looking around i think i might just plunk it here anyway i know it doesn't really match up do i give up and plunk it here ah there is so much crammed into this little place um do i pump pumpkin here so anything else to fabri i don't think that's the same oh i think unless i can find anything else in this quick scan round [Music] i am going to plunk it here yep i'm gonna plunk it here be done with venice right let's see yeah quite so nothing so that's got it here don't have to be quite zoomed in um this basilica nothing like the words i saw on the front was it the bits up underneath so confusing ah if i'd only seen that maybe i would have had a chance but i didn't i got annoyed and i gave up so [Music] i've lost three points for that never mind on to the next one right um [Music] so i've got to work out which language this is airtel do i know that i don't think so trying to find the street i can't imagine it's going to be easy so is this um i don't know if it's indian or bangladesh because they're writing similar right yeah yeah now aroma correctly there's not much official coverage in india i think the same is in bangladesh there is some though what else can we see okay now that will give us anything that takes us back to this point here um that's about it for fruit door hmm what else can we get from here or is it going to be a plunket i'm no good with these rounds um banglalink that point to it being in bangladesh it's about all i've got to go on let's see here so could we be in the center could be here but who knows so i saw a mask back there i'm sure there's gonna be more than one yeah this isn't a lot of streets let me see if we can see if that will help us at all uh maybe behind further back there uh i don't think it is this one then it's historic white mask with a star motif another one doesn't look like the writing's the same i think it's gonna be a plunk and hope this looks like fairly similar text maybe let's go here which way did i go i came from that direction just to the east so the mosque is here let's say down here um i can't see where i was now let's see so this sign here that was a little road it could be that little road cycle bazaar do you think there's a bike shop here so where exactly would we start let's presume this is the right road somehow somehow anything [Music] airtel i think there's airtel on here that's that little road i can't see anything that says airtel it's probably not even the right road to be honest is it let's go let's go here let's see let's see could it be the best guess no at least it's right in the right city so i'll take it didn't at least only lost nine points that's not bad could we have found it so there's the most there it doesn't have that shot an electric shock i mean sorry that is electric shock is not what it said on the outside oh well i'm not i'm not mad at that i am not mad at that at all any tips for working out the difference between indian and the bangladeshi language and how to pinpoint where you are in either of those countries i think mostly official coverage has got to be just in the big cities right so that might be worth something to look at all right last round hopefully something easier port elliott sipping save okay royal family hotel we driving on the left i think we are so could we be back in australia again maybe new zealand this time sun is there i can't really tell that's in the north or not um i think we might be now i'm not going to commit new zealand or australia all right let's have a look if we can find any other information some signs over there elliot gardens i guess a place is probably called port elliott what do you have on you it's just a pub or something i don't know but we can go down this road here i want to go down there thank you all right pelia terrace i'll get something this is dollars but i think it's toughest in new zealand i don't know i don't know national diability diabetes service game port elliott pharmacy we can't make out anything on there go this way will that help nope nope what do i think do i think australia and using and probably turn out as neither of those and i've got it completely wrong all right it's called port elliott isn't it like this c well visible doesn't mean there isn't pop down here a bit further friendly grosser surf shop well looks like a strand [Music] cookies [Music] all right let's see what this sign tells us church art gallery library hotel good give me a web address somebody gone go on [Music] uh southern surf okay so it's got to be near sea then it's called port elliot it's got a surf shop yes dot a u right cool big old country let's have a quick scan i might speed this up because i've taken quite a while again and i'm going to search all of the south because it said southern surf right yeah and search all of the south or a place called port elliot see you in a bit [Music] found paul elliott cool good right where did we start uh by the pharmacy wasn't it poor elliott pharmacy um i'm pretty a terrace this looks right royal family hotel that must be the uh pharmacy there zip and save family hotel um are we right on the junction i'd say so maybe there right let's go for it cool and a good score at the last round not bad i'm quite happy with myself actually to be honest i think maybe i am improving or these are just easier maps let's be honest it's no uh hard map is it really the uh no moving no panning no zooming ones or anything like that i find these more fun more relaxed and hopefully you enjoy playing along too so not a bad score not really not bad school very good very happy how do you guys do let me know in the comments below i hope you enjoy playing along with these games maybe a bit easier and more fun to play along with um i'm hopefully going to do some geocaching soon whether you're interested in seeing me fumble around in the countryside trying to find a tiny little pot to write my name in um last time i didn't film so well hopefully next time it will go better and you'll see that on the channel soon all right thanks again for watching like comment subscribe and all of that as well please that helps me to know that there are some people watching and you enjoy what i'm doing alright thank you very much bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 49.66917257272249, "lng": -103.85624801498841},

"hello welcome back today i'm doing another play along of course um and i found this map called pinpointable pinpointable bridges sounded interesting so we'll give it a go seems to be fairly easy so hopefully you won't get uh anything too hard but let's see so let's get into it this is a challenge copy's a link and the link will be in the description below let's go all right um let's say brisbane looks like brisbane right does it look like australia [Music] no idea really um [Music] but i'm gonna go with brisbane it seems to be quite a lot of bridges now where is brisbane there it is which bridge are we on so a minute so we're looking at a wheel and a brisbane sign sometimes that's noted on the map so that might be good to look for or this is performing arts center and we're looking at the river south it's going south east so maybe around here or yeah still no good with the directions let's have a look here so gallery of modern art on the bridge towards the performing arts center is to the south west so down here or something i guess performing outside i'm just going to look for the performing performing arts center oh there you go performing arts center car park that was nice and easy victoria bridge all right are we on the center of the bridge maybe a little bit towards the end so maybe a bit down here i've lost points on bridges before synchro is in the center and it's not all right let's try that cool 5 000 points let's hope the next one's easier easier as easy um all right this is a city i've never seen before don't think uh where are we west gate bridge south bank boulevard some weird statues thing cheap removalists what okay okay um korean fried chicken uh dot com dot a u so we in australia again we're in australia again any other clues as to what city we are in [Music] um [Music] south bank boulevard hmm not sure not sure at all but i can move of course can i try and work it out without leaving probably not victoria university not in brisbane again are we i don't know what that says there or is that just a bunch of christmas lights all right let's move a bit yeah i think those are just some lights this looks like a canal boat so is it the canal victoria universe isn't there's a place called victoria isn't there all right let's have a look oh it's a state they call them states um so maybe melbourne do you think it looks like a big city um [Music] it's got a river in the middle of it westgate bridge this looks good here a minute can we see victoria university doesn't pop out at me but that's a book so these buildings to the north is there a tram going over because i feel like it might be this one that doesn't look right either oh there's quite a few bridges quite a few bridges right um this one looks like it's got a tram going over it and so does this one and what else can we see so the university should be around here somewhere victoria university okay so how do you work out which bridge we are on [Music] i have a feeling it's that bridge um south bank lookout sea life center let's see if we can see the sea lice there it is okay this is looking good i think we are on this bridge now what side are we on and how far down are we so quite near the main road on this side so let's say about there let's go 5 000 yes this is good i am liking this we gonna have another australia around or we're going to venture elsewhere this looks cool it's a cool place wherever this is um let's see truck give us some information uh dot com no dot a u so it could be america or it could be anywhere um so we're driving on the right it looks like a truck i would expect to see in america um not really much else to go on [Music] for me anyway for someone who doesn't know america much is that a yakult no hood don't know what that is um what else can we see change play him i don't know what that says uh move in something a hotel and over here don't know what that says no ideas a theater theater district because that says king crab maybe all right paper corporation [Music] what's this weird is that like a jetty or something very strange lobsters seafood there's a crab place so guessing a place that may be famous for seafood of the crab lobster variety i don't know what that says so i think i am going to move on this one and just see independence war concorde financial district financial district of where seaport boulevard [Music] north 93 ted williams tunnel like this means anything to me um hmm what do i need i'm gonna just have to look for this route number 93 um whereabouts i'm thinking like new england kind of area i don't have something about lobsters around here but i don't know i am not sure so oh here we go rank 93 right there does it go anywhere else is it just here okay goes up here to there so is it possibly boston i'm not gonna try boston accent that would not go well right what did we say let's put a pin there okay so we lose it seaport boulevard i mean is it going to be this bridge there's a lot of bridges going on here is that that weird thing we were looking at before could be here um this is a highway well and then we've got trains i don't think it's these because they look too big long fellow bridge um i need more information i think and it would help if i looked what direction we were going in i mean this is fairly big road i don't know what this is over here um so 93 north i mean is this the highway ted williams tunnel did we see that um commercial street oh there's more down here look uh it said something about independent wharf didn't it let's see that bit here so there's a ted williams tunnel that's a ted williams tunnel going south so um maybe up here somewhere there's another bridge here does it look like this one a broad way um i don't know this is a toll road big old bridge that's a bridge with cable table towers don't know what that means all right let's get back onto this bridge what can we see from here i see one bridge there with a weird boaty thing in the middle and then this i guess we can see a docks so the docks to the north east so where are the docks where [Music] are the docs says constitution war maybe that's what we can see he [Music] doesn't seem doesn't seem right but on the other hand it doesn't why is there two things here what's going on in this strange place i don't understand oh come on must be able to find this why is it why am i second guessing are these all wars around here i think they might be i think they might be sea pork boulevard this is the one right where did we start did we start in the center no i started a bit further down uh that's the crab place down here way around here let's give it a go yes my lord right let's try the next one let's see delaware river pennsylvania and new jersey so isn't the delaware quite a big long river some kind of army navy boat thing scary gun boat maybe that might help uh so this is a toll rogue baby delaware river is that the name of the road what does this sign tell us state aquarium camden waterfront right i've got to find delaware first now philadelphia pennsylvania uh delaware here right yes okay so we are going towards the state aquarium camden waterfront oh got to use a 676 interstate whatever that means so there were city [Music] uh there's delaware memorial bridge and this is commodore barry bridge uh look out for six seven six as well fault muffin oh myth not for nothing now here's the six seven six there's camden so could we be on this bridge marshall battle yeah battleship new jerseys the boat i can probably see so we could be on the benjamin franklin bridge so which direction is the gunship thing over here to the south so that's to the south so i reckon we're on this bridge um and if we start in the middle [Music] it's quite a long old bridge isn't it so i'm just going to go with the middle because i'm not too sure right on the border state border i guess i'll plunk it right in the middle let's see that means perfect score the last four rounds that i can't comprehend that right now i hope it's a good round oh come on right oh no and everything blurred out as well oh no damn you cheer guesser so it's like an eu car with two blue parts which i believe means italy has all of this blurred out what are you blurring out here so close to a perfect school i'm going to want to really spend some time on this aren't i so what we've got going on nice beautiful mountains lovely looking water can we presume this goes out to sea or is this just a big lake now of course there are some big lakes in italy so it could be those that's a train line going along so i think go and have a look at some signs seeing that was a cable car going up there so let's pop down here and we're going off the bridge here and that's going to help us radio rsi doesn't mean anything to me sbbcff that the rail company i know initially they have i don't think it's that i can't where it's called though so i'm not sure this is italy oh oh dot ch be czech republic so it looks like we're heading to a tunnel that way probably going through the mountains could be crossing over a border hmm i think i need more information i mean this is only got one blue badge so might have been a red herring but that van could be traveling from to anywhere across europe um no so close to a perfect score okay let's see what else is at the end of this very long bridge i know there's a tunnel are you gonna tell me where we're going tunnel doesn't look like it okay i don't think so let's go the other way then so we went where should we go it went that way didn't we yeah let's go this way anything here i think i saw a sign back there uh can we get over here yes come on show me the sign [Music] oh that's kind of italian to me i am that's a legano all right first ink sticks italy so i've got these lakes here got lugano here um so what was this line for oh okay what's that wasn't oh i didn't realize switzerland went so far in and that's interesting hmm are we around here let's have a look so that does go into a tunnel look pop is there a minute is there a train line yes okay okay hmm where else is going tampion uh which roundabout we're looking at this one this one let's see oh there's campion okay okay i think we might be on this one could it be could it be have i just worked out all terribly wrong let's go back to the beginning i'll be right on the center facing this bit of land to the south so on the map maybe this bit of land here oh i'm going with this bridge and i'm going to go in the center of this bridge and i am going to hope for the best come on perfect score yes finally finally oh my god who would have thought on a map of bridges i get a perfect score on camera at least that's amazing ah how well did you guys do i'm glad i picked this easy map it turned out it was easy for me how do you get on i mean i think we got very lucky with those rounds they were quite easy and it got us to a perfect school i hope you guys did too let me know in the comments down below and uh [Music] who knows what will happen next time thank you very much bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": -27.47256003989788,

"hello welcome back today i thought i'd do something a bit different i found this uh map that has all the english football clubs so i thought why not give that a try i'm wearing my brighton hove albion shirt for it as well 10 years since we've been in our new stadium there's going to be a lot of small clubs in places i've never heard of so i'm not sure i'm gonna get anywhere close to a perfect school um but let's give it a go and see what weird little clubs we can see on this map so let's set this as a challenge copy that link link will be in the description box below let's start the game right okay darby that's a fairly easy one if i can remember where derby is and being a southerner everywhere above the south downs is north to me it's a derby i know is north but i'm not sure how funnels oh there it is nice and easy to find so i presume it's on the outskirts the stadium so let's have a look let's say costco i didn't know we had costco in the uk there you go anyway let's find the stadium a little bit further out let's see if we can spot anything else it seems my computer is struggling to load these pictures right there's a self storage place over there otherwise can't really see much else so [Music] i thought this one would be a quick one got to be around the outskirts somewhere ski slope cool and i presume it would have a pointer on the map ah is it pride park stadium is there a self storage yes okay so i presume we are right on this little thing at the front here but maybe not let's just have a quick look around weird little oval roundabout i think yeah let's go yes cool so i expect to get little unknown places next let's see and gateshead gateshead international stadium right i know the name gateshead not sure where it is um now is that in kent let's have a look is it down here gateshead or is it north as in anywhere else in the uk i don't think it is down here is it doesn't look like it right so i'm going to scan the map for gateshead i'll speed it up if it takes too long i don't want the video to be too long again i don't believe i can't remember where it is [Music] my god so why it took me so long to find that but finally found kate's head that's very embarrassing that took far too long right kate said international stadium where might you be again probably out of town somewhere rugby club uh community center [Music] juices there's some kind of arenas i don't think it's that though right so james's park this is newcastle do i recognize that stadium name but get back over the river then i guess where is cake's head is here so let's not zoom in so far uh it's rutherford it said rugby playing fields this has not been a good round for me isn't it gateshead international stadium wow you are a hard one to find for someone who doesn't know anything north of england all right where are we so maybe just right on the corner does that look right there's a road here is it oh no it does carry on up there so i think we're probably maybe around here let's have a look oh good after all that got the full point so i'm happy about spending far too long trying to find gateshead let's see what we got next dover i know where dover is dover rugby club and dover athletic fc welcome to crabble crabble okay let's have a look so dover is in kent unlike gateshead so i said grab all maybe there's oh yeah crabble stadium david rugby football club so do we think we're this road or this road that's a look uh so this comes round from an estate excuse me my voice went then so [Music] entrance is facing going into the south so i think it is probably here that we are see there is a road that goes in though could it be this one i'm gonna go um am i am i gonna go with that one on that one i'm gonna go stick with this one let's have a look no there's two points on that definitely not where does it matter [Music] it does matter a bit right let's see what we have next frankie benny's scum thorpe now i'm sure that is up north somewhere on the coast frankie and penny's look for let's see bbc radio humber side okay so this should be around here she says it's probably going to be the other side scarborough scum thought hmm scum thought there we are this is a little better not on the coast but a little better so let's go until bowl and what did we say was quick fit and frankie bennie's outside let's see he's rugby club it's consort bold i don't think that's what the stadium is called and what else can we see i'm born club no no how far do we go down [Music] it seems like quite a spread out town doesn't it give me a look it's gonna talk united football club here we go is there there's a kfc and things but not what did we say quick fit and frankie bennies oh there's quick fit maybe it's burger king now not frankie and benny so are we on a roundabout yes yes we are oh is it m s which i saw on the map didn't i yeah oh there it is m s yes i think we are here put a marker there and hopefully we don't lose two points oh yes good right this is the last round yes is it a good one it's a bigger stadium this is manu i think this is my new isn't it not sure though i'm sure it is kind of looks like man used badge could move but i haven't moved this game have i i don't think i have let me go menu and i'm going to try not to move so i guess this is the main front entrance that's probably a guy called bobby something that looks so manchester it's old trafford ground here we go [Music] right where is the statues that's east and that must be all right i don't know who that is um these are e numbers aren't they yeah you've got to be on the east side and we are on the corner there's a road zoom out a bit so we're probably around here let's check so we're looking at stadium and it is if the compass can be relied on to the south west maybe a bit further let's go for it come on yes yes oh i wish i was more accurate on that other round i wouldn't lost the two points well i'm quite happy i thought i would do worse on that map apart from not being able to find gateshead which i don't think i'll be able to live it down to myself i was not good but nearly a perfect score again maybe i'm getting better at this game how did you do do you support any english clubs let me know in the comments which ones you do support maybe brighton hope albion as well let me know let me know how you did uh and hopefully maybe the next game i'll get a perfect score thanks for watching bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 52.91445479999999, "lng": -1.4484556}, {"round": 2, "lat": 54.96007705502382, "lng":

welcome back uh today i'm going to try an easy map european capital cities i've got a fairly decent score before uh so let's see if i can get a higher score maybe a perfect school and uh drag you along with me so let's give this a go so this is a challenge copy the link let's see what we get all right um see what we can see in the number plates not sure ah is this prague yeah it looks like it so it says prague r2 without on the uh street sign which means it's prague section two or i'm not sure what they call it exactly in prague so let's see if we can find the street let's go in here [Music] forgot where prague was so you see it says here prague 4 prague 10 so that's what we're looking for is prague one there too sorry uh so uh it's near the center somewhere this is seven one not here somewhere just not seeing it there's three that's obviously one oh here two okay so what are we looking for italska and mana or solver so i don't know how big these sections are let's have a quick scan around uh it's not the same one [Music] let's just check where we were did we start there a bit further back right on the junction looks like it to me so right on the junction here yeah let's give that a go yes good well i don't agree with that pointer but you got the 5000 points it's a really good start let's see what we have next [Music] so casino phoenix uh [Music] so we're in euros here so road numbers one two and four hmm so i'm thinking around scandinavia maybe but maybe those the countries below it which you've got for the name of now uh do you think that's the street name possibly else can we see [Music] this is dot e e e e is that estonia maybe let's have a look in estonia so i'll be time oh there's road number one okay good one two and four there's one two and four so we might be right in the center here mark down there a minute right what else can we see what's on this sign here bottle money yes don't know what that actually says or how to pronounce that this looks like a pretty big building or is it a car park hmm i'm still thinking that this is the name of this little street which might be quite hard to see maybe fenix casino might stand out on the map or this i'll put that in the corner let's see what we can see uh there's a car park there no around here any casinos [Music] um no [Music] no i hope i'm not missing it i hate when i watch these uh videos back when i'm editing them and going it's right there why didn't i see it and uh to be worried it's taking too long and you're having to sit through it right it's got to be around here somewhere right so maybe casino is not the most obvious thing to find i don't know what kind of color pointer it would have either okay i think i need a bit more information or i need to remember the name of this i was looking for mere me uh let's see what this sign says here it says mere two it's a number four so do you think it has the same thing as prague maybe so they've got it's sectioned off says mardi 6 mardi 9 maybe we're looking for something like that but i don't know how zoomed in or zoomed out we need to see that kind of thing [Music] maybe we can look for this bank which was swede bank is that just a atm it's probably just an atm which aren't noted on the map i saw one up here somewhere um [Music] when i see that i thought i said piggy bank um okay i'll probably sweep this up but i'm just going to scour the map for the road name near mere four i'll see you in a minute [Music] finally so i found mir here so let's see where were we samir goes around here as well there's a car park could it be the same one hmm is going to take some working out which i am not good at it also goes down here oh look it goes down here too [Music] it's car park still down here still down um [Music] cool this is not cool nothing was it casino in a car park there's a car park an atm right uh so did we see a tram i'll be there a minute we see tram lines here yes there is a tram there's a little triangle would that be on the map it's a hotel hotel virus let's try and find that as well hotel veru so i'm just repeating it so remember hotel veru is that this one well this road is called veru great it doesn't have a name on it handy um that's a different casino there's swiss bank but it's not the atm um how am i going to work this out i want that full points that doesn't look like the junction it looks too big that road see anything on this map is going to help me with uh where to put my pointer down ah not helpful it goes around here too hmm maybe i can have a look at oh bus stop what do you say stop me yeah twisty so maybe there's a street near it called puesti that would be the bus stop or maybe the pst here stands for [Music] twisty so that won't help oh this is very annoying to me do you know how to work this out would you do a much better job than me let's see so there's a park over there and that's to the north so it could be down here [Music] could be down here coming up to that park two lanes with the tram down the middle looks like the tram is down the middle ish oh here you go me pusty tram stop tram stop these tram stops or bus stops i don't know i thought the channel was here in the middle it could just be the way it's laid out on the map hmm so we're probably near this one so i'm going to go [Music] i'm going to go here because we're a bit further down right let me see that big junction it's probably up there i'm gonna grill i'm so sorry for my uh when i try to read these words um what's this routine could that be this junction yes that's a bus there's a bus lane [Music] here's a bus lane coming up towards the park the park again here might be this bus stop fenix casino oh that'll be on this road or this road let's pop us here come back to the start euro park hero park entrance sorry euro park didn't i you're a park here tommy creole i saw that as well that's there so we're here facing south so tommy grows behind us euro park entrance here i'm so confused about where oh yeah i will get better at this i swear hopefully um so i think we're up here i think we're here let's just go with this enough mucking about so it was on this little road here ah i knew it oh well but we still got the 5 000 points so take it all that mucking about sorry to sit through that right let's hope the next round is a bit kinder right this is not official coverage 100 iceland hotel so are we in iceland do we think um we can move so let's see dot is so i presume that's iceland any street names [Music] let's see so in the middle of a bunch of hotels there looks like a bay all the season it's a pretty north south road say going towards some water so keep it here so we're going north towards some kind of bay so could we be around here or here hotel cabin says hotels are still around now uh i think it might be easier if we've got a road name but we'll try with these hotels first so iceland 100 iceland hotel track [Music] 101 guest house so i guess that's the building number i'd have to resume iceland hotel oh guest house 101 guest house it's a quick scan for those [Music] well maybe these hotels will not help us put my locker here so i don't lose that one have another quick scan around 101 central apartments this is what i won guest house was the one i put my mark in there black tower 101 okay iceland summer 100 iceland because it was 100 iceland hotel wasn't it so um okay i'll put my marker here so does this go up to a bay it could be and let's see i don't know if you can hear that there's some people screaming outside i'm sorry about that as well as the uh seagulls right there's 101 guest house okay so i think we started new that one didn't we go back here 100 iceland hotel so i think we are here souvenir store maybe it's in the hotel so i reckon we're about here let's go for it yes oh this is good however shout is having a bad day but i'm having a good time all right fingers crossed another easiest round two more to go can we do the perfect score right now flags i should know what this flag is my first reaction is romania for some reason but i'm not sure that's right not sure at all um very lovely building though holding back i don't recognize the language it's got little tails and little tip things on top of the letters that will help when i look at the map it's raining you have that yeah so they have little tails and little things i don't like the name for it um could it be bucharest and let's let's try and find some more information pop down here i think um can't let me see those signs no um so this is a river obviously so maybe that might help us on map quite a lot of river going around here so let's look in the center a minute so i don't lose our place right what direction are we going so river bends round towards the north and then this way still bending around towards the east all right now i'll put that into practical terms on the map uh so it bends around to the north so i'm no good at working these out i've got to get my head around this otherwise i'm not going to do well [Music] i want a street name that's what i want so let's pop over here here we go kalia victorie [Music] and that's coming towards the bridge so let's have a look at every road going towards a bridge [Music] so that plan didn't work oh there's more up here okay here we are yes mark down there right where did we start right in the middle of this junction so that's the victoria road and that's a road that goes alongside the river so i've got a little um maybe that's a little road there's definitely this side of the river she says yeah so that side or this side is so i reckon this is the road that comes around we're here around the main road that goes alongside the river just before it goes over the bridge is this way so i think we could be so they don't look that far apart let's go over another bridge let's just check just in case it's a very long road [Music] and then this stops there okay where'd my marker go down here right so i think we're just on this junction here possibly because we're in the traffic going that way those just don't look right but i can't see where else it would be i'm going for it i'm going for that one let's see okay so it was that little junction up there all right but we still got the full points final round could this be no so i've had this round before it'd normally be called celebration but i can't remember where it was so remember it was in kosovo but i don't know where so i'm very lucky for me that i've had this before because before i just did not know what country it was i didn't recognize language um and i couldn't think which european cities didn't have official coverage so that really didn't really didn't go well um i still got to work out where it is that's not biz isn't it yeah i don't think i missed anything that would have helped me know that this was in kosovo and let's have a look around i went the other way last time so let's have a look around this way i do colors of benetton this is kind of a theater maybe nothing else on the building um where else can we go there's a statue which might be a good marker point i can't really read that could go closer i suppose maybe this tent will give us something now we can't get towards that i don't know what that says we can go a bit further this way uh that's still the bellaton store maybe this is the thing that we need to look for the statue okay let's have a look at that so where is it this one so this is myself very lucky that i already know the country it's otherwise i would never never be able to get this far but this looks pedestrianized so does this here um or not so it's a whole pedestrianized street isn't it there's another nice one that's a pedestrian bit oh says this really all the grey ones are pedestrianized roads right can we see [Music] united colors of bennett is that what they're called don't know if we better see it oh so close to a perfect school although i don't know if i want to count it because i already had this round even though i can't remember where it um venison [Music] benefits that's a ministry saw something that was like um theater didn't we could it be this no these are the pedestrianized bits right um don't know there's some statues anything like this is what we want to find like a picture point do you say what you are no just a square maybe i should look for some other hotels or something this is a nice long street uh let's look for benetton oh there's lots of things maybe we should look for another shop um [Music] or i should just plonk it because i don't think it's fair that i've already had this round although maybe you guys would be at a workout it was kosovo just from the language i thought it was italy or somewhere near italy anyway um now i can't remember i can't see anything else on here okay let's see let's try and find some more information to help oh is there a sign there's a sign no no no i can't see the sign oh can we there's no way you're gonna read that okay what else can we get this is going to a main road maybe we can get a road name from this main road that way this way that's as far as this guy goes oh [Music] you more modern sculpture didn't see anything like that bank bank thanks a blue usually i think oh down here okay oh no there's kind of a dark blue like this one uh bangkok economic so it'd be bk now let's stop long enough for this street [Music] banker uh i think i'll have to plonk it soon because i didn't do well the last time on this round i think it's a bit well it is very lucky that i've got it again although this will happen on these kind of maps i guess especially when there's not any official coverage uh so a bit more scanning for the bank pro credit bank no okay okay i'm going to plunk it and i'm going to plunk it i think this is a pedestrianized area it's a long street maybe this one it could be up here there's a banker there's that's the bank isn't it okay how do we work out is that the theater we saw so that was a theater how far did we go which way did we go we're going from that direction which is to the south so from where we are now see it will be the south we went further down here we're working out right um i think i'll just leave it here near the theater it'll be close enough but not close enough for a perfect school which i don't think i deserve because i've had this round before so let's go with it oh oh it was the right street one point off i think that's fair i think that's very fair um bit annoyed i got the same round again but i guess that's what happens when you play the game that's part of it and i should just go with it because it's going to happen more often the more often i play um [Music] yeah not bad but would you have worked out that it was kosovo did you did you get a good score on this round where did you guess well let's see how i well i know i did overall so i feel that perfect score is coming that perfect score is definitely coming soon thank you for watching please subscribe and like and all that stuff let me know how you did in the comments um will i be able to get a perfect score before you probably not so let me know thanks for watching bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 50.07878053017046, "lng": 14.436858468530545}, {"round": 2, "lat":

"hello everyone welcome back today i thought i'd do another capital cities map i enjoyed the 198 capitals of the world i think it's called i found this new one what capital city is this i thought i'd give it go maybe get a better score than last time perfect school probably not but let's give it a try anyway so let's go make this a challenge the link will be in the description box below if you want to play along and let's start the game so it reminds me of europe to start with where in europe could it be [Music] you see this sign no um oh here we go so lv do you think is that latvia not sure i know some of them are not necessarily what you would think they would be i think like spain is es espana i presume uh let's have another look around there's any other signs we can pick up on um that looks like that being flag so i think we are definitely in latvia so let's see this street sign here can we get that this this gapper gate and i think we're facing the river were we not facing the river in a south west west direction i'm loving this new compass at the top here they've added very useful for me right so let's get into riga there we go okay so let's say south west to west so [Music] we're probably on this side i mean this new company is great but you know it doesn't necessarily help me okay so let's see what was the name of the road it's a road going up and stopping at the river so we'll get a church there the scapper gate right and it stops at the river so it'd be one of these type of roads right um so there's a church there these roads called no and this one oh here we go the scapper gates pop us there a minute so where did we come from [Music] just a bit further down was it still on this kappa gate so got one road to the side there i think we're probably around here um yeah let's go for that a bit further down all right so i do need to get my directions right but 5 000 points let's go let's see if we can get a perfect score hmm okay this is a photo sphere quintin kruger um not really sure i've got some flags up here but i not sure what they are is that the south african flag possibly i don't know what this one is here um hmm [Music] okay well i forget that perfect school let's try and get a an okay school do you think this is i can't see that we can't move anywhere else can we bring these buildings uh no number plates no wouldn't help me anyway still tuck took i think this is a hotel i presume no sign okay okay so the sun is coming from that direction doesn't help that's if the compass is correct sorry this isn't quite i don't know where to go is it gonna be is it south africa isn't south africa coverage though so why would it be a uh photosphere um i think these have the sort lesato and espartini also have coverage it's kruger national park it's taken by quintin kruger maybe that's the weird tangent i should go on i don't know it's capital cities so there's a lot of capital cities around here should we go with the one closer to kruger national park so pretoria what is this what's this place mozambique i don't know um because there's two there excuse me i'm gonna try pretoria i don't really have a lot else to go on without knowing the flags properly so hotel somewhere in the center i guess this one manhattan hotel there's not a gas station something that looks a bit like um yeah paul kruger street what if this was right that would be weird wouldn't it it's not gonna be right is it is it i think it's tom's place i don't i don't know what else to go on i'm afraid so i'm gonna go for thomas place near paul kruger street just because of the guy who took the picture let's see okay well same latitude same area of the uh world it was in mate is that amazing it was in mozambique we weren't on this coast that's never where that place was i don't see any sea must be here anyway not too bad i could have been the other side of the world so i'll take that let's see if we can make up for it in the other rounds right where are we um maybe another african country let's see make things happen oh does that say los attoll sorry i'm not not sure how to pronounce it i think it does say that you tell me anything south africa limited south africa oh bankrupt you can say south africa limited country um right what else can we spy so it's official coverage and i thought these areas were covered by official coverage this is the sultan this is the capital because it has that dot on it let's pop us there in a minute um is this a bank let's have a look around the corner shall we so there's quite a main road ned bank the soto pro led bank the soto investment so i think that is definitely where we are um and then this over there is what might be so much trouble speaking metropolitan wow wow that's what i struggled to say that word okay so ned bank looks like quite a big bank we see there's like a financial center um you presume it'd be pretty central this is quite a big road this looks like quite a big road too let's just have a quick scan around and see if we can find it um again what i'm forgetting to do is have a look at the compass so this road goes east bends around so it could be this road oh probably be the other way i think ah terrible um they could still be here well there's ned bank metropolitan insurance yes we are here so we're up around the corner weren't we um that'd be classed as a road yeah it's up the side of the bank this is the bank here let's pop ourselves back we're right on the junction so let's say about here i bet the marker's further up but let's see let's go cool another 5 000 points i'm liking this game how are you guys getting on right now did you do better in the last round because maybe you knew the flag maybe i should do a flag test next right where are we now [Music] um could it be europe is that an eu flag and a macedonia flag that has like a sun burst on it i think but avery's established i am no good with maps um with flags uh okay let's have a look on the road and see if we can pick up some number plates to see if it is eu or macedonia in the eu and it's north oh oh we've got underground that's interesting i wanted to see some number plates so this is one way to do it let's see if we can get back out okay no idea where we've landed now it's weird isn't it okay so anything in these shops while we're here madrid telecom hmm interesting could be my mind's just come completely blank on a spanish flag it's embarrassing yes it is spanish flag oh my lord oh my lord that it's terrible i was lucky i saw that sign otherwise i would have gone back underground the north macedonia route okay so do you think we'll be able to find this hostel santa cruz on the map looks like a nice square which stream is quite a lot of them i mean this big building here would be better is it a theater i think it might be might be a theater plaza maya okay let's have a look in the okay pretty central i presume um plaza mayor there we go madrid vibrant main square well there you go never been there so that'll be a tip if i go one day so where is that that's a hostile interplaza mia um where is that big building though [Music] um so this is the presume where we dove under the underground um so where is [Music] could it be one of these i don't know why this is confusing me so much let's have a look back yeah so that's a hotel plaza mayor and this one on the corner at the end the hostel santa cruz so that's the wrong one isn't it so hostel [Music] santa cruz or there's a lot going on around here isn't there um further out could be around here no no i'm just not seeing it because i presume this it was around here is that that 17th century building let's is look a 17th century building we've got a road running alongside it though this is a road um so we're looking at the building on the south so that can't be it there oh there you go is that the one ah all turned around no santa cruz crew soul i don't think i'm gonna find that hostel on here so what's the other hotel called again just plaza mayo and there's a fountain here so a fountain on the map anywhere tower plaza mayor this is an interesting building it's on the south this could be it here plaza de santa cruz so that's why that hostel is called that on this side okay i think we're here so where did we start right up is that that building right opposites building around here yeah uh probably here actually all right let's go oh i don't know why that took me so long sorry i had to sit through that okay next one last one oh lots of blurred out wow it's got to be germany right germany has a lot of blurred out images on google maps this is one bit of meta i know how far do we have to go before we can see anything oh wow yeah so i think this is yeah it's definitely germany uh rudastrata can we see what this building is or is it going to be blood museum [Music] hmm i don't know i don't think i'm going to get a better view of that sign okay let's have a quick look down here that's still rude estrassa maybe okay that's a quick look down here the amount of blurring is just ridiculous wow okay we can do this we can do this so sharon strasser and something else begin with a p let's give this a go i might speed this up depending how long it takes me so uh maybe see you in a moment [Music] okay so i found there's an overtell across the street berlin mita mitta so fern found that here so now we need to find buddha stressor oh fully it's got to be around here isn't it so this is burning meter i didn't go across a big road hmm there was a road underneath somewhere here we go blue distress right let's have a look back where we started so we're in an underpass by the looks of it just pop out the other side can we see absolutely nothing so um where could that underpass be i can't see anything [Music] i presume it's under this road how does that work how did we get there okay so we went up this way under the underpass i saw a street sign here ah somewhere amongst this blurs ah germany's so stressful i'm sure i saw that here didn't i how did i see that ah such a horrible amount of blurring germany stop it all right sperling's gasser here we go so sperling's gasser sperlings casa where is that where is it oh come on i want to get perfect score on the last round maybe it's just not going to be possible because germany liked to blur out everything it's really well me up there um okay i can only assume this is the bipart of the underpass that we were on and i must have come out here and then saw the no hotel down there so i'm gonna put us right in there and see what happens okay oh it's underneath building i didn't even think of that and there's sperling garcia right oh well i did get a bit annoyed that was my own issue dropped one point on that so close so close oops did you do any better on that let's see don't want to go and have a look at them okay sorry so let's see the summary how did i do oh 23 429 very happy with that very happy got to brush up on my flags i think i was lucky i was so close i could have been millions of miles away so that was very lucky i would say other than that again probably lucky with the signs quite a few european rounds which are helps but yeah all in all i'm happy with that school hopefully you've done all right as well but not beating me let me know in the comments below and i'll see you next time bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 56.94865074272673, "lng": 24.103117723881}, {"round": 2, "lat": -25.959189, "lng": 32.605625}, {"round": 3, "lat":

"hello welcome to my channel um i thought i'd try something a bit different this time i'm also trying to learn japanese um i learn i know about 1-200 kanji maybe sometimes i play this world cities tokyo map to sort of test my skill um and just see how it how it goes it's a little bit harder but it makes it a bit more interesting so i thought why not add pressure and film myself playing it as well so uh here we go let's see how i do i'll do a challenge as well so in case you want to play along and i'll copy this let's give it a go all right let's see here looks like a little suburbany area maybe um so let's see if we get a street sign so usually you'll find like a sign at the end of these roads that give you the details of which district which area of tokyo it is and what number the block is so that makes it a little easier to uh pinpoint where you are uh it doesn't look like there is one here so that already makes it a little harder see if this shot gives us any clues um [Music] yeah so a lot of candy i don't know yet one day i hopefully i'll be able to read that let's see if i can work out anything as this no not a clue this is ramen let's see there's any road signed for the next town or something maybe it's like a post office just tell us where so let's see if i can work out any of this so that's river and that's mouth or opening so it could be cowar kawaka i think but um not very good with these candies just yet let's see if we can find an area with zo's kanji so we're looking for oh here we go how about kawaguchi do you think that might be because that is also read as coochie but with a goo for rendaku which is means the way you say it they sometimes change the reading of it so it's easier to say or makes more sense i guess in the language so i think we're probably in this area so let's have a look so quite a big area that looks like so that's already not helpful so what other candy do we have here that could possibly let us know more i don't think it necessary does i don't know what this candy at the end here is so i'm just going to go and find a post office in this area there's a post office here let's just pop me down here a minute and see if that lines up with anything i don't think it does kawaguchi see something so maybe central hmm don't know about that uh let's see if that correlates with anything else on here zoom back out a bit is there an area of kawaguchi it says that i'm sure there was so that's a train line i'm not sure and i'm feeling the pressure to to get a pointer down so let's go for this area let's see is there a train line around here i don't think so [Music] so it's probably not this post office can have a quick scan see if there's any others so there's one down here um let's see any others it could be a small one that you have to zoom in closer to the map to find which doesn't help all right let's see this one what do you look like because you look like your opposite the big place it's on a corner is there a bus stop outside not really i don't think it's this one either this is going well isn't it let's see what else before i just plonk it somewhere let's have another quick scan and see if i can find anything else that color correlates with that in fact i'll probably speed this up so you don't have to sit through [Music] okay i can't i can't find one that exactly correlates with that post office so i'm gonna go with this one here so where did we start from not that i'm going to get the right road because i don't think we're here so we went this way so we went south so so i'm going to put it here i'm feeling a lot of pressure doing these recordings i'm going to just go with it here and see what happens right yep it was meaner i should have looked a bit longer i probably could have got that maybe you did let me know let me know if you got that one all right let's try the next one okay so another estate maybe let's have a look at the end of the road and see if we can get that sign i was talking about it's not gonna happen for me today is it lovely buildings here though okay let's see if i can work out what that says um can't get any closer to it so annoying nope i'll get there one day this will be a breeze one day uh tossed him no idea get to the end of the street and let's see what we can find there busy area so this probably tells us something and it's about walking i think i think that's a candy for walk ah moving somebody no i think it might have something to do with the uh the crosswalk let's see what else can we see here there's mcdonald's i'm playing the mcdonald's map though are we um i'm gonna try that junction where mcdonald's is so oh that got dark oh very dark this is not a nice picture let's move on ah better right [Music] now so there's another a nice lawson there did lawson say where they are that just says what they're selling i believe so train station give me something train station that's the name of the station there let's see if we can work this out so [Music] i think that the east kanji so that could be higashi or [Music] tall oh no idea this is the same as that part here right oh this is much harder than i thought especially knowing that there might be somebody watching me do this [Music] let's see and get a better look at this so i reckon i reckon i don't know i reckon i do not know so let us see uh it might not be a big enough place to be in bold i've got this one which part are we looking at this is probably a good thing to learn is it the top part or the bit here i know this candy at the end means station i think that means door hmm [Music] okay i found matsudor which looks like these two kanji here so maybe it's east matsuda possibly so let's have a look at some train stations around here no nothing that looks like it um [Music] that's your door shinden station i'm gonna put my marker there so i don't lose where i am um this station no that's your door so that could be i don't know i don't think that's the same i think this is another fail let's see here there's an awesome okay i don't think it's that one i am going to [Music] go with this one but there's no lawson nearby so so that's convenience store so that's a 7-eleven not a lawson is that awesome no hmm nope i don't think it's this one either hey oh there's an awesome man i'm gonna go with it i'm just gonna plop myself here let's see let us see it was the right area but the wrong station well nevermind let's move on let's skip over that okay going to work going to work let's see oh this looks like what does it do i want to say that's a gun down cafe down there then and i've just gone blank i can't remember electric town i can't remember the name of it now that's embarrassing um but i think it is look at it on the map and then i'll tell you uh why i can't remember the name of it now and i can't see it it's here akihabara god all right let's put me there so i don't lose myself oh i can't get out of here okay so oh let's see where those ring signs are [Music] does this look like accio barrel it does so so that's big camera over there udx office that's good to know how far this way can we go let's see can we get out of here okay crossfield akihabara yes i'm glad i got something right right now i just need to pinpoint where we are i think i remember going up to this place when we went a while ago now because obviously no one's allowed to travel anywhere which is so depressing let's see so we come out there's beck's coffee shop so the gun down cafe should be next to that there we go so this building should be up here yes so on this walkway won't we so probably here let's see can we get perfect score yes okay good it's got one good round and now just lower again okay we can do this we can do this it's a big road here's gotta be some signs right what happened there another cpu sorry i don't know why keeps jumping around like that user error i'm sure so tommy or okay so this has got to be an area right a bit of a shame i can't push myself to use more can you because it's written in english but very helpful all the same let us see comey or car okay i'm worried about this video being too long already so i will probably speed this up [Music] okay i can't find it i can't see it anywhere so i'm gonna go for a punt i'm going to guess that it's out here somewhere so i'm just gonna scroll in here and pop it somewhere uh but i don't want to we're gonna have to near a big road [Music] i didn't realize it would go that far out because really there's quite a big area the tokyo area but i thought see can i go i thought that would be part oh well never mind i don't think i would have been able to find it anyway because what i was looking for was not the name of the area oh it did me on points as well didn't it did you persevere did you find it let me know let's see what happens the last round hopefully this is a bit more forgiving well there's a ferris wheel doesn't feel like a diver which is the only place i know where there's a will or something there one out in yokohama as well um around here i think ah i never went out there i don't know this area very well not that i know any of it very well um okay let's pop it there a minute and have a look and see what else we can find can't go that way you can go and have a look at the little dotto train so look maybe these signs here give us something [Music] no no okay what else can't see what's behind that train [Music] like food i think no [Music] let's have a look here see this building gives us anything got some nice flags outside don't tell me anything that maybe you guys might know what the other flag is so it's like a conference center or a hotel or something uh i cannot read that i can't read that so let's skip down here to the see if there's any details on here so there's a nice little bridge says something about water nope don't know see maybe this is a place i should know where we are does that mean we're on a coast um [Music] a fishing area well this is this is not good um okay i'm gonna stick with this area i think this looks like that do you think am i just clutching at straws probably just clutching at straws i really want to go to the cup noodle museum one day um okay so is there anything that looks like what we've just seen there's a little river i don't know if that little river would be on here anyway probably like a stream or something uh there's a hotel needles park it doesn't say where the wheel is so does it and i'm probably know my luck completely the wrong place let's have a look down here and she probably checked the compass that would be good i do that's north ah i don't know what that's gonna tell me to be honest i'm losing all faith that we're around here so yeah um i already thought there was a wheel around here somewhere tokyo strawberry park no probably not okay i am going to go with my first instant put it down in yokohama am i yes yes let's stick with this area and i will go here yes let's see of course right near the sea life park oh i'll have to add that to my list of things to go and see fresh water see license nice oh well rinsed on points again let's see how i did overall terrible started off okay and then it just right downhill from there didn't it i don't think i beat my highest score on this map let me know how you did did you uh have more patience than me and not just plunk it down places uh let me know in the comments do you want to see me try and do this again maybe once i've learned a few more kanji maybe not in tokyo around japan itself let me try and push myself to to learn the language as well as get better at g i guess thanks for watching see you again ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 35.83087921142578, "lng": 139.7707061767578},

hello welcome to my channel or back if you watch my dismal first attempt at uh coming back to geoguessr not really knowing anything and recording myself for the first time so here we are back again i'm going to try world cities it says it's easy i've got a decent-ish school before um let's see with the uh added pressure of recording myself and uh hoping to be able to beat some of you out there on this map so let's give it a go make this a challenge just copy that let's go right um well no first thoughts here europe oh so sweden just looked the other way first okay cool let's see what city we're in is it's stockholm or somewhere else i don't know if they have details on their road signs about districts or areas in their city um 18 to let's have a look sweden let's look at stockholm and see if these numbers correlate with anything in stockholm let's see ah so there's no numbers i can see on the map here let's see if we can find kin stu garten king's kitten stu gutten yes uh well there's kungska [Music] probably a good idea to see what direction the road is going and so i know what direction road i'm looking for right so let's just take this one so it's like this i have no good restrictions that's like that way on the map i presume if i've got it the right way around [Music] [Music] no uh i'll probably do is speed this up so you don't have to sit and listen to me going get into god couldn't sook up be back [Music] i found kittens to kind stew garten right now [Music] svartman garten is where we were so here's we must be around here somewhere right up further up here so this is the church that's behind me do you think must be right or is there a church at that end there's a church there hmm so this is where [Music] knowing your compass really comes in handy so what else can we see that could pinpoint where we are now we're definitely on this junction right so we've got to be over here i'll say probably there so we could check where we started a little bit further down so [Music] the church on the corner restaurant cafe art gallery maybe these have changed oh i'm gonna go for here yeah let's see close six yards nice all right let's try the next one okay so i presume this isn't in china maybe a chinatown [Music] somewhere this looks like an american ambulance brighton interesting not the brighton in the uk where i'm from so third avenue south east but where so that's where canadian flag is it is it all right don't panic let's carry on there's some big old buildings over there any of these signs so many signs around here anything give us an idea of where we are um don't say canada is this in canada oh yeah right read what it says is a helpful tip for everybody out there starting alberta health services that's canadian maple leafs there so alberta is there a city in alberta called alberta i don't think so it's more than likely calgary cause that's like a big city as far as uh right third avenue south east did i see another sign for i'll try and do this without moving let's see so third avenue southeast ah wow third avenue south west ninth of new south east so as far as i know these roads are some kind of order to them unlike our randomly named rose so that's third avenue north east third hour is south east does that mean it's just in this area seven nine [Music] eight uh street nut avenue nine nine eight five four four must be this one here three yes right so there's an hsbc behind us must be able to see that come on is hsbc not here unless we're not here which is also a possibility and there's a lot of ah there we go hsbc bank right this is something ye building tang dynasty restaurant that might have changed by now chinese national league tang dynasty here we go so i'm gonna pop us there yes seven yards this is going well how are you guys doing so far i'll admit it's pretty easy so uh i'm not gonna go crazy on the celebrations so here we go kiwi movers dot co dot uk uh so we're in london gotta do good at this right right where the hell in london are we and i have to go i'm gonna have to move the road signs in the uk let you know whereabouts they are so this is london borough of camden nw1 which means north west central north west i'm not great with london i try and avoid going there if i can let's try and find this place so london camden it's a pistol in it oh how embarrassing coconut hungry where is camden why is it not from here am i being blind tandem [Music] so the borough could be quite a wide area though so uh sorry my uh wanted to just want it to turn off so um right jamestown road nw1 gosh don't that's gonna stick out necessarily jamestown right okay so a coffee shop that also does osteopathy physiotherapy and treatments and coffee what what crazy all right so this street is pretty much east west so let's try and find an east-west road it's called jamestown that's facebook jamestown east-west james tower okay i think i will speed this up because it might take me a while and i'm gonna find it i am determined okay i can't find it on first glance i think i'm gonna need to look around and try and find more information about where this is exactly or come to a bigger road that might help is that a bigger road it's like if there's any other detail hmm overall road oval road where the oval is is it the cricket ground no because that's that's the other side of london right look the pirate castle the pirate castle the hell is that regents canal okay canals there's canals in camden so regents canal it's got to be around here right there's oval road jamestown road ah fantastic the pirate castle is a boat cool okay so there's a banksy up there look see if it's still there down this end right i guess not down here nope i guess it's gone or being built on or or something else no can't see it all right where did we start outside gilby house listed on here [Music] probably not let's see not far from the end so second big building in can you see that road probably new i have it further down so four five houses down or something like that it's that weird coffee osteopathy place i reckon there let's go for it five yards glad i've got the four points of the uk right this is not gonna this is this is not gonna end well for me libertad progreso sorry about my pronunciation there right my usual question spanish or portuguese because i do not know the difference and that will let us know where in uh bolivia maybe but have you the oblivious coverage huh let's have a look [Music] public all right i'll stop trying to read the language let's go into bolivia if i can remember where it is there it is what's your big cities la paz let's have a look at la paz um so pretty pretty good crossroads i guess uh i can't see any massively just that one tall bit i don't know what kind of a place it is if it has tall buildings anyway i do not know it's like quite a big place quite a big place okay is this really sign give us anything else like the provincial area just can't read any of that um is there another sign we can look at yeah okay let's see if we can so i guess this is mountainous area all the wiggly woods so i'm going to look for something a bit more like this see here's some kale i wonder what that one is can we see it nope no no oh that's not good let's put back here um if we go this way maybe this way see please don't people oh trees trees in the way no why is there no other rose signs here [Music] hmm what about on these shots do you think look at this something [Music] no no no no um let's try down here shall we just quickly all blood out why why ugh look at this way something nothing no nothing nothing but now no no oh no okay go back right so we were looking for oh where did i it's down here wasn't it let's try the other way quickly spinning around and around down here can we see can we see nothing that i can read just going a bit no [Music] no um let's go this way can i zoom in and see no no no ah why what's the point of having maps so you can find your way and you blur out the road name does that make any sense all right let's go back the other way again i could read at least one of the road signs there and where were you this way bottle okay there's a lot of roads okay i'm gonna speed this up quickly have a quick scan see if i can find it if not i'm just gonna plunk it somewhere huh okay so i was running the wrong city ah this is santa cruz de la sierra that sounded pretty good uh so i found republic so just need to work out which part of this one it's quite a long road um potosi didn't i see put something on one of these partially visible signs let's see was it this one potosi yes so did we start on this road yes so we're in potosi we're on this road uh we are down this end where is there a bank here two cities a bank is that a bank let's see probably probably around here do you think so you've got the building on the corner then this one and then this one not sure about this but uh let's give it a go typical should have spent a bit longer checking that still just noticed 5 000 points 90 yards wow well this is a very forgiving map right last round and i think i'm on for a perfect score [Music] i've just jinxed myself with that i guess we've got cyrillic awesome [Music] is this a ladies bar i think it is nice um so is this russia or is it another country in the area that has cyrillic i don't think it's greece don't think it's greek some kind of crazy horse-drawn carriage thing what interesting very interesting all right where are we what country are we in can you tell me shop no idea how to read any of that okay let's see if some of these posters give us an idea i don't think so um oh no always something on the last round we can do this we can work this out somehow okay i guess that's the address to does that help there's a market all right um [Music] got to be something that will help us work out if this is actually russia or not um another sex shop an interesting place gastro bar nice things on the floor here russian car there oh so now we're on the other side of the market oh i don't know guys and there's a lot of pressure thinking there could be somebody watching me get this all wrong um see if this building at the end here gives us any signs maybe a flag something [Music] the club the club no no no no no no no zamzybar i don't think we're in zanzibar dot p y stop p y what's dot p y oh no oh i don't know dot p y [Music] i don't think that's bulgaria oh no i need to read up on some of these oh that says dot are you there okay i am not having fun with this one and i feel the pressure to not spend too long because i'm recording myself and i'm probably boring you guys with not knowing anything what's this map tell us where all the coca-colas are is that a river all right let's have a look world cities moscow [Music] obviously quite a large city in russia is that can we match that up somewhere put you there let's have a look an upside down version i don't know where is it that does not work okay so let's try saint petersburg maybe that's not a river could it be this well i don't know much about russia i think there's slim chance of finding exactly where we are what kind of vibe do i get do i get some petersburg moscow oh statue that could be handy maybe what did you do in there no idea what is that supposed to be ah couldn't have been like red square or anything like that to really help us out here could it all right i'm gonna ah if we go some petersburg it's a long way from everything else in russia could end up with zero points so man always on the last round i'm going to go moscow got to go moscow really and we're going to go it's not near the cramming do you think you'd see that right let's go [Music] [Music] [Music] never heard of it god well i had gone since petersburg would have been worse right so there's that okay perfect score not good god so close though so close well let us know how you did in the comments i would hope that uh i might have beat somebody out there russia was a nasty round at the end but let me know there was something i missed in the signage that i could have picked up on without knowing any russian i don't know how either that is in russia maybe there is a way thanks for watching i'll see you again bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1, "lat": 59.32448674157381, "lng":

welcome to my channel um learner geo gesso here trying to make yourself accountable to continue learning so i can get better at this game um so i decided to make this channel why not maybe some of you would like to learn along with me maybe help me with some tips yourself um and i'll impart as much knowledge as i got which is pretty much zero right now um i also hope to do some geocaching and um upload some of those videos again not very good at it probably out of five caches i go and find they'll find one so let's see but hopefully i'll be going different places away from the home town to do geo get caching and i hope to go to japan again next year so do some geocaching there which would be fun for the meantime let's uh try some geo guessing and uh hopefully you'll enjoy this channel if uh you want to be able to beat somebody at the play along because that is more than likely um i've been enjoying this map 398 capitals of the world got quite a good score but um i did have help for my husband for that so i don't think that really counts so let's give this a go so let's play i'm gonna make a challenge if you guys want to play along and let's just i'm gonna double check that's copied all right i'm not going to set a time limit because i am not going to handicap myself like that just yet this being my first one or two videos so let's go um america so washington dc independence avenue so let's have a look this is a nice easy one to start off with hey washington d.c independence avenue there let's see independence avenue south east and capital something oh okay very strange the way american roads are named i can't get my head around it uh s capital streets of south capitol street southeast i guess that's what that one is so could we be here let's just have a quick check around what we got i can move of course there's some building there's a big park there big park there so i'm building here and we're actually on independence so let's say we're about there yes nice so now it gets into something a bit harder this is a photo sphere hmm cool huh i don't know how can i get anywhere near this one but let's see where do we think we are suki's ice can't see anything else on that sign i really don't know number plates at all um i think we're in somewhere in asia maybe not a good round for me hopefully you guys are doing better um nope no idea that's the person who took it jocelyn travel borst doesn't help does not help one bit what is going on here got a lot of little trucks i'm guessing this is in asia somewhere but i couldn't tell you where what where in asia doesn't have much coverage that'd be good to know right i don't know um i don't feel like it's any thieves i thought indians you had good coverage of hmm unless it's a small now these are all indonesia isn't it do i just let's do it let's just plonk in jakarta um outside jakarta somewhere let's see no perfect dominica right other islands so zero points for me hopefully you guys got that oh this is embarrassing isn't it next right so middle east somewhere another photo sphere see what we got up here yemen i guess we're in yemen even mobile can we work out where we are in yemen some big road outside uh a park i need a kitty cat can you get uh so what's this building new idea okay let's have a look at yemen where is yemen yeah good that would have been more embarrassing wouldn't it so um i would say this is a big road oh let's have a look is that a car park more than a road what is going on here is that a road um i had that park too small that actually show up on the map there's a little park there but i don't think it's that one what else can we use i see any weird thing up there i'm not gonna believe the compass because it's a photosphere so it might not be correct the hotel but i don't know what the name of that hotel is is that crucial house um let's see some prince hall um oh there's a hotel there's one there isn't many hotels shall we pop ourselves near the only hotel i don't think that's the park is it there's another hotel um i'm gonna go there i don't think we're gonna be able to find anything else like the uh whatever it is called crucial building let's give it a go not bad all right i'll take it yeah big car park that's what i said idiot oh well next one hopefully you've got some good points ah that's quite recognizable chem is it a photosphere so we can't necessarily trust the compass on what side we're on why is that police that's a here scary um so rome is and then coliseum now what side of the coliseum are we so we've got some nice buildings up there a road over there but i don't see the other ruins that are outside these ones here so i'm guessing we're around this side somewhere so pop cells here a minute is there that little sticky-outy bit can we see that a little bit with that um i don't know that's a little sticky a little bit is there a road next to it there's a road all the way around um this road goes out here i'm gonna say we're over this side somewhere maybe here opposite side lost a point wonderful never mind let's go for the last round huh police oris aurism station tasted nassau is that a island this is another photosphere another photo sphere ah just by luck first recording and it goes like this eh so it must be an island there's some pirate ship out there lovely building [Music] um native shows which island are we on is that tourism station i think that's tourism station okay a lot of it's in english that help me probably not because i ain't very good so what do we think it's a place called nassau yeah so i'm thinking around here somewhere but there's so many let's have a look at tuvalu oh no i don't think it's too high um i forgot what i'm looking for already nassau that rings a bell isn't there an island called nassau am i just making that up am i thinking no um i'm sorry for those that are shouting now because you know exactly where it is i am sorry um nothing called nassau here but maybe the capitals missile is it oh dear [Music] i'm going i'm going over here i'm going i really am and i'm gonna go [Music] whichever one is lucia um on the coast there's a plunket there i can't i don't oh there is a place called nassau and i didn't see it oh how embarrassing hopefully you guys knew there was a place called nacelle and went straight there oh oh dear let's have a look at the summary so 15 829 well you should definitely be able to beat me on that that's terrible all i can say is it's got to get better from here right like confusing a south american place asia terrible i thank you for watching i'm sorry it was terrible hopefully you can beat me and uh let's i hope it will get better next time give me some tips and i'll see you then bye ", "locations": [{"round": 1,
