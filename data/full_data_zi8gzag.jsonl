through some diverse world seeds and just explaining my entire thought process so that you guys can have a better idea of what goes through my mind when I'm able to get rounds really quickly so instead of going really quickly I'm going to be giving you my full thought process this video is also kind of an advertisement for my second Channel where I do really similar videos every single day so if you want to get better at the game then you should be following that every day it's really really beneficial I would say but okay let's get into the first one today so the link for this game will be in the description you can check that out hit the link and play it before you watch me here so that when you watch this you can uh compare it to your own guesses and see where I was able to gain some extra Insight over you okay first one here is interesting so let's break it down uh we'll have advanced tips and beginner tips in this video what I like to say first is look at the roadland so we've got white outer lines here with the yellow single Inner Line obviously we have polls here to help us out but first off this yellow single inner line is not found in too many places and especially because we have this this Asian language here we can really break it down so yellow single in a line you can see in Thailand in Southeast Asia you could see it in Japan and South Korea as well normally Taiwan would be using a double yellow line and then many of these other countries like like Indonesia could also have it as well so that's basically covering most of it I think Cambodia as well but yeah it's fairly common in Asia but then in Sri Lanka and in Bangladesh and in Malaysia you would not see it so you can immediately rule out some countries like that when you see this um we also have concrete poles with kind of dots all the way down them and this kind of big spike at the top and that is definitely something that you'd see this big spike at the top you definitely see that in Japan and Korea most commonly so basically narrowed it down to those two already and then we have this black and yellow guard on it um which does not go all the way down to down to the ground that should be somewhere in Korea because the Japanese one would have vertical stripes whereas these ones are horizontal um or not horizontal but diagonal um let's have some Farmland here which makes me think more of the South um are they black rock walls there I'm just trying to think this could be Jay Drew because in Jeju you have black rock walls but I think this is just something that's been burned let's check it out do we have any black broccols here to be honest it doesn't really feel like Jeju I think these mountains in the background are too far distant um so yeah I wouldn't go Jeju here instead I would probably go somewhere in the south of the country like this ends up being 43 kilometers away so a really nice start there um so we'll make that a one country streak and head into the next round here okay next one um we don't have Google car here I've intentionally blocked that out so that we are teaching more less reliant on meta tips which I think will serve us better when the new generations of cameras come out and stuff like that um okay so this one immediately feeling like Europe with this architecture right um one thing I would say is like if you see a road without any markings and it seems like quite a wealthy or a wealthier country um then it's less likely to be like North America more likely to be um Europe so especially because it's quite thin as well if if if you couldn't go two cars abreast if it's only enough room for one car to really travel it's more of a European thing I would say definitely let's take a look here at some of these houses so we've got like some like kind of red tiled roofs here some of the houses are kind of black and made of wood which is interesting um as for poles they seem to be made of wood or is that concrete it's actually kind of hard for me to say here this again is actually kind of hard to say we have hooks on either side like that um this kind of hooked pole is most famously found in Latvia but with this amount of healiness we know we're not in lavier like you'd never see a hill that tall in Latvia um in fact the whole baltics are quite flat so moving down towards maybe the more Balkan side of things you do see this kind of hooked pole like that quite commonly in Bulgaria not really sure if this is Bulgaria but it could be found there also I feel like Slovenia and Croatia quite often haven't maybe even Montenegro as well so that's kind of that's kind of some thoughts here we have kind of like a reddish soil which I'm not really sure how to interpret either but okay let's check out the sky here because we have some mini Rifts so I do wonder if that could maybe indicate that we were in a Montenegro because obviously Montenegro and Albania are the countries where you do have bigger Rifts often in the sky but we don't really see those so I don't know um taking a look at the rest of the architecture and everything I do think it could fit for Montenegro obviously we don't have that kind of typical like Rocky uh Mountain face that you would often see there um so I don't want to get baited here um so let's just take a look this house almost feels like a bit Austrian in the way that I would expect to like see in Slovenia or maybe in Croatia but the rest of it is kind of generic so yeah this one's actually kind of a difficult round I I may end up going the wrong country here I think my instinct is one of these three countries I would be surprised if it's not one of the Eastern countries that I've mentioned here um and I think I may just go from Montenegro because of these mini Rifts in the sky although as I said they can be found in other countries and I would not be surprised to be wrong here um but okay if it was Montenegro I would say maybe maybe further in the south of the country like somewhere like this and not too confident maybe I should go Slovenia or even I don't know yeah architecture it's all it's all a bit ambiguous I can even see possibly Serbia yeah Serbia is not impossible um especially because we can't see the car whereas so we would normally have no idea but we can't see that of course okay so I could hedge it in Serbia that's not actually a bad idea I think maybe I should have you in Serbia here well I've talked a lot and I think I'm just gonna make my guess here I'm gonna hedge it in Serbia and it was actually just over the Border in Montenegro so we lose the country there but get quite a good score okay that's good to know um and so sometimes in montenegger you won't see the full Rifts okay next one here is pretty straightforward with the language but let's talk about how uh this round is getable so this kind of black and white um diagonal um sticker on the pole is quiet Russian we also have like all white Road lands which you definitely see in Russia we have these long white number plates which don't have a blue strip we have this red and white um kind of uh thing on the pole which is actually quite a Russian thing to do um houses off uh feel quite Russian here green roof quite a Russian thing to do um not super common but if you see it you can definitely consider Russia uh round speed signs here obviously and The Ballad spam at the intersection this is a big one so Russia at Russia a big kind of Highway in sections which you'll see quite a lot in this coverage you often have these ballards with the black top and uh not necessarily with a black top but you often see like a whole bunch of them lining the whole um in section so um obviously then we also have this Russian language here and so now we've got to think about where this is so I'm looking at these trees they are really tall oftentimes really tall trees are somewhere around Moscow or a bit north of Moscow however I'm not so sure about this round whether that actually fits let's have a really dense bunch of like Birch trees here when you see a really dense birch trees that can that can often indicate like kind of like an obviously be as crass noise kind of area so I actually think I'll put my marker there for now as I look at the rest of the round because obviously Russia it's a hard country and so I could not I could not guarantee that I'll get close here at all um we do have some hilliness because that could fit for that kind of area of the country um harmatta would definitely help here but obviously we're going with that car um yeah it's just these trees that feel a bit more Moscow area but but yeah actually looking at these ones I I do kind of like further out now it could just be kind of two men um kind of Euros kind of area as well and kind of worried that it might be more so there um but I do yeah I do get the feeling that somewhere between here and here that's really my guess with these kind of really clumped tall trees um like this this this particularly looks quite Siberian and kind of middle Siberian okay so I have to make up my mind here again it's not an easy round so I'm just I just want to take my whole thought process in here as for me I think I may actually go Truman here instead of going further east but I guess we'll find out here I'll let us guess in human itself and it will be actually just in Moscow okay so uh I thought the uh tree those dense trees might have been more of a uh of a Siberian looking one but I was wrong uh the tall the really tall kind of orange barked trees uh where I guess the clue there and that's really kind of a Moscow area thing so at least I mentioned it but uh was not able to get too close there unfortunately it's still an okay score but nothing nothing very good okay next one here we have fairly obvious clues for the country so let's run through it so first off we're noticing we've got um blue strips on all the plates that's definitely useful um we have another number plate meta over there but let's take a look over this Direction first okay signage and language obviously do help as well um we do have these uh pedestrian crossing signs with only four dashes a characters that only use four dashes so Sweden and Norway two that only use four dashes I'm trying to think of on my feet one of the country is actually only used four because most countries in Europe use five or three um with some exceptions but they're the only ones that come to mind at the moment tell me in the comments if you can think of any others once you have all these long dashes on the outside of the road here this time it's actually quite useful so these would be like half the length in Sweden but you get this length in Norway also we know it's Norway because of this green normal plate over here on the service fan I can't really think of anywhere else that you'd see that on a van or that you may see that these days in Eastern Europe a lot of times green number plates indicate um like electronic Vehicles so that's also uh worthwhile to know I don't know where this place is um but I do get the feeling this could be kind of like Central uh in Norway or maybe southern um although I don't see I don't see Northern as absolutely impossible either I'm just not really sure so I think I might click Center here because I'm yeah I just don't really know uh there was something else I wanted to mention here obviously architecture would help out it looks like we're on some kind of a skiing like town or something like that I don't know where skiing actually happens but I suppose like where some of these toilet Peaks I might might be it but I guess my my real thought was to click over here just as a bit of a hedge as well because I don't really know where this is um but yeah definitely definitely going to be annoying that's something else I wanted to mention I think I forgot so let me know if you in the comments if you uh see anything else in this round but I will guess right now and it was just like down near the biggest mountains here which makes sense uh and was that actually ski Town it was very touristy for sure but I don't see any skis slopes so maybe just a tourist town instead but hey not bad oh we got the right country again and the last one of the first seed here is looking like it's going to be somewhere in um well actually let's take a look around here so first off uh first things first let's take a look at the number plates so this looks like a shorter number blade here which is very useful when you have this kind of Latin American Vibe because some countries use longer number plates and some shorter so this one also kind of feels like it's going to be a short number plate rather than a longer one now this one is really hard to tell but I think the number plate actually ends like that from what we've seen on the other cars it would make sense if the normal plate was also shorter here I think um we have wooden poles as well which is definitely interesting I I could not say uh this is a particularly easy round because I think the country we're in does normally use uh does normally use concrete poles instead of wooden ones so a little bit of bait here potentially um we do have quite a few Palms here um like the whole the whole Bible around is a bit Greener um than maybe what I would have expected um do we have like a number plate there almost feels a bit black but I don't think we're actually using black normal plates here this church architecture is certainly interesting as well although I don't know if I could really say anything specific about it okay moving on here um the sun here is to the South which I think is probably the biggest clue if you if you weren't really clued in with the number plates here the Sunbeam to the South is huge here because that really cuts off you know Argentina and Brazil almost to Brazil uh where you might be tempted to guessing around like this with quite reddish soil it's about the same but yeah with these wooden poles with this predominance of wooden poles it shouldn't be Brazil with the sun there it shouldn't be Argentina so we should be looking at Mexico here with short number plates and with the with the with the these poles um as I said Mexico would normally use like octagonal concrete poles but it is possible to see so many wooden ones and I almost get the feeling we might be very close to the United States here especially because on this bus it says stop instead of Alto which it normally would say Alto on stop signs in in uh in Mexico um also we have like three American trucks in a row here I think to see three like Chevrolets or Ford pickup trucks in a row inside um like South America would be quite unlikely whereas in Mexico it's quite common and then finally we also have like a Coca-Cola dispenser here and they love Coca-Cola in Mexico so that's also something to note okay with this many Palms we shouldn't be too far from water um I'm thinking like kind of this region over here um it could even just be like like near Tijuana like Mexicali kind of area but yeah I do I do not want to guess too far from the US border here just because the amount of wooden poles but yeah I think I'll go somewhere over here um maybe like this kind of this kind of region here I mean we can always check the angle of the road and it seems like it actually might be on a grid here so that could actually work um but yeah it's gonna be somewhere in northern Mexico let's just give this a go and it was actually in that kind of area there 28 kilometers away I think also this area has some more Red Dirt so that's actually a really nice guess making up for some of our poorer guesses in that one so let me know how you did on that first seed probably many of you beat me because of my lackluster Russia and uh uh no I guesses but uh let us head into another one here and hopefully uh improve on 20 000 which is certainly improvable on okay next link is also in the description so go ahead and play that and our first one here is a pretty obvious country for me um so let's run through why exactly that is okay so we've got reddish dirt here we've got a lot of corrugated iron roofs and we also have have a taxi here with yellow panels on it so uh with yellow novel plates and taxis with yellow panels this should mean we're going to be somewhere in Ghana pretty straightforward round especially because you guys will be playing with the Google car which um is pretty obvious for Ghana so we have kind of biggest mountains here uh mountains in Ghana kind of like along this section here and then South and around Kumasi um I think I may have had this round before the town feels familiar to me um but regardless we have wooden poles here um generally speaking uh Nigeria and Senegal would both use more concrete poles whereas Ghana is more of a wooden pole country which is definitely useful if you're playing no car no Compass or nmpz or something like that and we have these big ditches which also definitely fits for Ghana as well any other the other normal place is the big one here because yellow France and Rears should really just be Ghana here also a bit of English as well I can only assume uh the the crossbars are also kind of like thin metal here so well which fits and then also we have like big bulbs here which can fit for like Ghana or Nigeria quite often so I think this is someone new Kumasi is as far as I remember I think I've had this round before maybe a year ago or something but I think I remember so let's see if I'm right about that and yeah it was there I kind of remembered where that was so there we go a very good score to start us off with but yeah that kind of area is quite green and hilly so keep that in mind okay next one here we once again have that Spike on the top of the pole this one looking a little bit different though um and I'll take a look around here yeah okay yeah good to know okay so this uh is Japan we have the low camera here we've got that that kind of wide blur um we are set up for left-hand drive as well so if you couldn't tell us low camera should be left hand drive and that would pretty much exclude um South Korea because the sun is on the left hand side of the road here um this is an interesting one I honestly thought that this would be somewhere in southern Japan just based on this kind of long grass now I'm starting to doubt myself I think this actually could be quite a bit further north than I initially anticipated um so I don't really know I'm not I'm not a Japan expert so that's really worth bearing in mind here we have this uh black and yellow kind of guy wire here and I'm pretty sure black and yellow guy wires are mosh koku and then more Northern Japan and the thing that makes me actually think this is maybe Northern Japan here is these um like red and white poles here which I definitely think can be found around the place but are common in Northern Japan like in this kind of area here so that's where I think we are I'm kind of worried that this is all the way wrong and that we could be Southern here but it doesn't look like the solid guy why and those tend to be pretty consistent I also don't really know about the plates that I found on the poles here which are also useful um I yeah I'm just not too sure um it's not too Madness and you do kind of get quite a few flat regions around this part of the country especially near the coast so I could see it I might just hedge kind of here I'm hoping it's not on shikoku or something like that but um I'm kind of using these poles as my as my evidence here because this grass almost feels a bit more Southern um but it almost feels a bit like Coastal as well Vibes wise so we'll see here I'm just gonna go for the S and we'll be correct or not okay was actually on this peninsula here so I don't really know how the other guy wires work here it's not a bad score we're actually not that far away uh by Japan standards there but uh you know it's a fairly easy Japan so that's at least good with low camera always helps out okay next one here uh countries immediately obvious from when I load in so let's uh try and break that down okay so the double yellow line in the center of the road is actually quite useful here obviously double yellows um and uh meaning more often the you know the United States uh or South America or something like that um definitely in countries that prefer to use double yellows you can see it all around as well as I've said earlier in the video type one you can even see in Japan in New Zealand and all around the spot but yeah you know run around like this kind of flat concrete pole um kind of uh this American looking style a styles of like green and white text sign should be somewhere in like North or South America here now um I would actually say Vibes wise this is this is really quite an Argentinian Uruguayan looking Round And even still it looks much more Argentinian than it looks Uruguayan but that could just be confirmation bias because this can't be Uruguayan because in Uruguay instead of using double yellows they would have a double yellow with a white Dash in the center of it which we just do not have at all here and so that should mean we're in Argentina also this round poll with this particular pole top which is kind of like a bar almost looks like a bow or something like that that's Argentinian uh maybe you can find it in like Peru as well um but yeah yeah it should be just Argentinian here with this landscape uh yeah and also we don't see any mountains and obviously in the vast majority Peru you would see mountains so that's also helping okay so I think this is kind of like somewhere around here between Cordoba and nequan somewhere I'm not exactly sure where my hedge closer to Cordoba here um and uh yeah that's about all I have to say on this one it's fairly simple with the uh with the poles and the road markings so let's just go there and uh it was actually near the Queen instead should have gone further south but that's okay it was very green for that area often starts to get a bit drier by it then and your next round is kind of interesting this is one I would not say I know the country immediately so let's check it out I've got a sign which is uh red um outlined diamond or triangle which is uh set up for right hand drive so that that kind of a style of signage is most common in Europe and Africa with the uh with the um triangle we have like some fruit trees here so I feel like a warmer climate we have some like potentially holy poles here I would say these are probably holy poles so that definitely helps out um concrete pods with holes in them and we already know Romania Hungary and Poland are the three countries that love to do those these ones definitely seem thicker so Poland better to be cut out so it should be a Romania or hungry and this landscape kind of rolling uh with some more wooden poles as well I don't know it can be either it can still be either here and one thing that makes me think this is actually still possibly hungry is that this looks like another sign and it looks like it's really tall and small and so that would be a Hungarian type of thing to do but I must say that the rest of the round does feel quite romantic and so I'm thinking of getting somewhere on the border here because this really looks like a Hungarian type of sound where it's like small and high but the rest of the round I probably would have gone Romania so that's kind of my thought process here um it almost feels like a Romanian sign as well so I think I really do click right on the border here maybe maybe even just in Romania because I just feel like the landscape fits better anything else to say here a lot of crops feels quite sunny as well they both fit for Romania I would say um White Road lands obviously European thing and then we're lacking any architecture or anything like that so you can kind of distinguish the two countries from architecture quite often but uh yeah on this occasion maybe not do I trust this sign I feel like I maybe should just trust the sign but no I'm gonna go with my heart here my heart says like Romania on the border so let's see if I'm right and it was Romania good it ends up being just Southern there um maybe that sign in the distance was not what I thought it was um but yeah we come up with the country Street there so that's always good okay next one here I mean you know the country here so let's break down why exactly this is where it is okay so first off we've got the yellow diamond sign this is the opposite to the European style that we were just looking at it has a thick white uh post here as well which you would not see in Australia so that's at least something also we've got blue street signs here if you have like a Pure Color street sign like a blue one like a yellow one like something like that maybe even green um well I'd say blue and yellow definitely much much more common in New Zealand than Australia um Australia normally uses white ones with some kind of colored text normally just black text so it's really normally that simple um we also do appear to have wooden policy which is interesting and some taller mountains in the north there so this all helps um at this stage in time New Zealand is a country that tends to have more Generation 3 in less populated areas so that's just a good little rule of thumb um or less Generation 4 at least okay we've got Tom popular kind of trees here um yeah I mean there's not really too much else to say I mean this kind of uh style of Chevron is more New Zealand than Australia but it's kind of hard to describe why it's kind of a bit thicker a bit taller um and then uh yeah we got these like long rows of trees which are obviously also fits kind of kind of like Christchurch area so I could see us being kind of like in the outskirts of like Christchurch area even further south anywhere to like I'll say anywhere to Dunedin kind of works here although the mountains in the north feel quite distant so dunedin's obviously quite close to the mountains whereas uh Christchurch it's not that it's not that difficult to like find yourself relatively far from the mountains like in this kind of area I might even go over here to be honest that's kind of my thought here um I definitely think South Island just because of these like huge rows of trees um and wooden poles are often more common in South Island as well so I'll go there see if we're correct about that ends up being in that kind of area very nice indeed so we had some better guesses there definitely the Ghana the New Zealand uh came out nice and we've got all countries correct and I should have had better on the Argentina I really called it out so let's go for one more game here and see how it happens again in the description if you want to play along and first around here we have an extremely distinctive Road here so uh let me try and drill this one into your brain if you are someone who uh likes to remember some roads on GEOS so uh Chile is one of these countries that occasionally uses all yellow lions and when you have this overcast coverage on a concrete road with like ocean nearby and it feels fairly Southern a bit desolate but also quite green then you should be somewhere on is it the number nine or the number seven what is it the number nine here in southern Chile we also do have ocean here to our East which definitely makes sense for us to be somewhere like around here I would say if we see more kind of land in the distance here slight Hills that definitely fits that definitely fits so I'll assume we're somewhere in like the southern number nine here uh it could even be kind of a bit further up as well and so yeah that's what you're gonna remember all yellows concrete um overcast and uh yeah kind of dreary with a flack of trees but you can see forests as well of course like that so I'd say we just get somewhere around here and hope for the best here and indeed we are right there so very nice 39 kilometers away you can basically get three points uh by remembering that road because it's basically the only one in the southern region of Chile post um or like after the uh National Park of Torres Del Paine so there we go oh Pioneer so next one here Eastern European Vibe immediately with this kind of like rusted and colorful fence here um and also this kind of red and yellow a red and white Motif is very uh very Eastern European we've got another one of these triangle signs we've got our White Center Line here as well it's hilly we've got some like corn growing there which also is something you often see in that area of the world without an antenna this is actually a relatively difficult round and countries that come to mind with this kind of dry climate like Romania Ukraine maybe in Serbia maybe even Hungary or Bulgaria that kind of region is really feeling most likely to me here with the healiness about it definitely isolates it to certain areas we with that kind of healiness we probably wouldn't be in eastern Ukraine playing Western Ukraine and Romania kind of vibe here I would say single white line is interesting as well I feel like some of these countries would use this double double white so I'm wondering maybe maybe Serbia is actually quite possible here maybe this is Serbia I don't know about this sign I think roasted rusted signposts are definitely more common in some countries than others but it's definitely a hard hard to put your finger on it but okay if it is sober it's going to be Southern Serbia because Northern Serbia is quiet flat whereas as soon as you get south of Belgrade you start getting those mountains so I would say I would say I would say Serbia is a good a good channel here actually I'm not really sure about the country it could even be further north like uh Croatia Slovenia I just saw I have covered all my bases here in case I'm wrong but I think that's really the possible countries there Slovenia Croatia Hungary Bulgaria yeah without without Google car is difficult but I think I will hit it in Serbia here will be correct we won't Serbia even quite close yes we're actually on a good score to start off this seed so if we can continue on that luck and we have a yellow sticker on this pole uh so in Japan which we are again here with this low camera uh small cars have yellow number plates that's also another nice little tip here if they ever don't do Japan with low cam then you can definitely use that to your advantage this yellow sticker I feel like that might be you know this kind of central region here like gifu or something fukui or something like that I'm not really sure nagorno maybe even I forget um taking a look at the architecture here look like a flat roof we don't really have enough flat roofs to really get anything from that we have again this kind of uh black and yellow striped um guy wire which we last time saw in this region so maybe I even go in Chicago or something like that because that's when we had the last round with that but obviously as I said that's kind of like a North or Chicago thing this could certainly be north um I don't really see anything that I yeah this this this plug here is longer which I I think is something you see in the South and the North um like Hokkaido but the yellow one I really don't know I just need to learn my Japan matters at some point to get their guesses because they are really useful this is again a longer um a longer like kind of plaque here so I do Wonder uh whether this could be Hokkaido indeed I mean it certainly could be the head the head just kind of blocking our view and this amount of trees is a bit suspicious for Hokkaido but maybe I do guess further north here again that may actually be the viable option here instead but I hope I don't click away from the actual answer I'm gonna go I'm gonna go North here again as a hedge let's actually see about that and it was all the way South this time Yamaguchi Yamaguchi huh okay okay definitely not a good score there Japan is definitely a country where I could uh have some room for improvement but I would say those were just particularly difficult Japan rounds um normally I do do better anyway next one here we got wooden poles we've got yellow outside lines we've got a sign set up for left-hand drive with the uh triangle instead of the diamond so yeah with this diamond sign come over the yellow outside lines should just be somewhere with the triangle sorry it should be somewhere in South Africa we've got generation four camera as well so South Africa is uh yeah immediately the country of choice at this point in time the other three do not have our generation 4 coverage uh and so this this sign is also a very common sign to see in South Africa and South African countries you can also see that one in like Romania Bulgaria turkey and maybe something Middle East as well but yeah in South Africa definitely South Africa um and so what we say here about the landscape a lot of like corn or something being grown here um it's quite like it's quite industrialized we have clumps of trees it was quite nice I would say this is somewhere near hauteng like around here probably in mumpumulanga state um but yeah I could also see you could also see just in Hao Tang itself here so that's why I'll click right there um yeah that's about it to say here kind of rolling landscape um dryish that definitely fits to this region of the country we'll be right yes we were indeed so if only we've got Japan right we'd still be on a massive score but unfortunately that's not to be okay next one here and we appear to be somewhere in Thailand or something like that here based on this language right uh we have this like kind of like double lane concrete road that I was telling you guys is more common in Philippines but of course to that language this should just be somewhere in Thailand uh we do have what appears to be a type hole here oh this is interesting yeah we have one of these like bulb things now do we do we have oh unfortunately we don't have any pole close to us because that could actually really have helped us out getting a close guess but as for that yeah yeah this kind of bulb can help you get a close guess if you can see it clearly but unfortunately we can't count the number of ribs on it so we cannot get that kind of uh perfectly closed guess that we'd like to uh yeah these fences are quite Thai particularly with this kind of like Motif going on inside here um and apart from that the main thing to get here is the language really um I don't think I would have gone Philippines though I just think something about it is more tired with these fences this kind of architecture of these kind of stilts houses we got going on here like this particularly like with the stairs going up to the family room like that um so for this one I could see kind of anything from north to south this is very generic it is Hillier so maybe I don't really know I'll probably just click somewhere like that because I can see South here still is a lack of there isn't like a Palms I would say that we don't see a single Palm so to speak we do see a banana plants everywhere but no no actual palm trees from what I can see uh yeah so maybe I will click further north here not really sure lumpung seems possible so I think I'll just go over it but uh yes we'll find out where this actually is should be Thailand indeed but whereabouts and it is another nice guess 52 kilometers away so man we had a really good uh game there if only Japan was good I mean even if I clicked here it wouldn't have been good we had to get the right place there so I'm going to learn my guy wires after this video I think and the next time we come to Japan we'll be stronger than ever we'll learn whether it's yellow blacks are and all that kind of stuff uh maybe that was the southern long Clark but anyway guys uh let me know how you you guys did in the uh in the comments below thank you very much for the support do subscribe and like hopefully this was helpful to you in some way and uh yeah it was a pleasure I'll see you guys in a video very soon till then goodbye [Music]

that is obviously strange because we're driving right hand side of the road so the steering wheel should be on the left so this is actually an illegally imported car from japan what is going on guys zigzag here welcome back to another geographer video and this one is the third installment of teaching series where i show you guys in-depth round breakdowns and challenge you guys in the description so yeah find the challenge links for the description inside today's videos you play the rounds before i play them and then hopefully i will be able to if you're a weaker player than i am i'll be able to show you where you went wrong and that kind of thing also in today's episode we're going to be playing without the car um so yeah without the google car and that will actually um yeah make things a little bit more difficult but it's also a better way to learn because then you don't get reliant on the um you know the google car meta so this is challenge link one go ahead and hit that one and uh let's see how we go in the first round here okay so this one is going to be in generation 2 camera it's a little bit of an older camera um work here and it feels very tropical look at these banana plants over here um so let's take a look at everything we can see um we have some trucks over here is this the same truck three times in a row is this a camo glitch i think it literally is just three of the same truck parked in a row but yeah definitely an interesting one um so for me there's only really two options here it's either gotta be south africa or mexico because of the generation two um and and the fact that it's quite tropical so either way all the way up here or i think what's more likely is that we're gonna be somewhere in mexico but the the houses here don't strike me as particularly mexican to be honest um so maybe it will have to be south africa um yeah i think it actually is going to be south africa here now that i'm looking at it kind of almost looks a bit australian which is not really something you don't really see too many mexican rounds that look australian still a a weird round to be sure um but yeah i think we should go somewhere over here and pretty far north um but also quite green so maybe richards bay i wouldn't mind that we'll see and yeah this was 115 kilometers away so a really good start um i was actually kind of unsure with that guess um it was to be like this is really bad i won't restart the video but no there we go it's a it's a good it's a good start and uh yeah near durban there okay so this one is curious and that was what that was a very difficult round so no worries if you didn't get it it was kind of a vibe one um the architecture was the biggest clue because a lot of the times in mexico you have the paint in front of the houses you know the south american style architecture anyway so here we are um in what appears to be a european scene so first off noticing this white colored dirt it's very flat it's very flat all around uh we have some a-frame poles over here which is probably going to be a clue and the biggest clue of them all is this bollard which has a number on it and it's painted pure or it's not painted but it's got a pure a red section over here and it's white otherwise um so even before turning around here um we know that this one's going to be a polish boullard uh this is also a polish sign not only does it kind of look like polish language i mean if you know you know um but it's also green and those kind of green signs kind of like uh poland and hungary quite common in those two countries uh but this uh particular font as well is the polish one so i know with beyond reasonable doubt with those three clues that this one's going to be poland and honestly the flat landscape and everything fits that quite nicely as well so i think we're going to be somewhere you know fairly central here actually so i'm just going to go here a bit north of warsaw and yeah this is right on the border with the ukraine actually before 1400 is a good score so on to the next one uh this one is looking asian off the bat we can see that um this kind of spire here and these kind of like a pointed rooves are quite asian looking to me uh what's interesting is we have like these crisscross bricks which is going to be interesting this one's an asian van as well if you know your car makes uh you know that the asian ones are obviously quite common in asia um whereas like in south america or something you'd be getting more european cars in as well as asian ones uh and look at these roofs here so definitely super asian so now it's time to look at the power poles to see if they're going to give any clues because one thought i did have um was that this might be thailand thailand tends to use square poles though so even though i thought these might look thai they are they are not i don't think because we don't see any of the square poles and they're much more common over there so now my thoughts are turning to indonesia it's quite dry obviously thailand has a large section of dry area out here where i've just drawn this um this triangle also these islands out here get quite dry from from kind of the uh eastern point in java all the way over to timor-leste it's very dry um in indonesia so also this uh number plate appears to be black as well so i'm feeling fairly confident with that um for that reason i i think it could be bali um i might go in this city over here on the next city over um but i do think we're gonna be somewhere in this section here so let's see if i'm right about that and yeah this actually was in the um eastern part of java like i said it might be um and uh yeah i may easily have gone over there um but uh we still pull 4000 which is pretty good for indonesia i'd say next round okay so here we go and we immediately are greeted with some very european looking architecture don't really think we'd see houses like this anywhere else in the world so let's take a look around but we have a yellow sign here which is very um indicative of former balkan countries um these yellow signs i think slovenia croatia i think serbia has them too uh maybe north macedonia too i think maybe those four have them um so that's what i'm thinking off the bat um there's probably others that do as well i just can't remember this car is lacking a blue strip which is curious that could uh be a hint for later on as well um do we have just looking around at what the architecture is like here so we also have a like kind of a peak over the sea and a um and a dash over this sea and i see suffix i do definitely associate with croatia i have a bunch of croatian viewers said no doubt they'll be in the comment section but um yeah i think that i see ending especially on like a last name or something it's very croatian at least to me uh also we don't have any holy poles so that kind of uh excludes uh hungary as well but this language wasn't hungarian so it wasn't really an option to begin with um and also the lack of a blue strip i know is something is a bit more common in croatia so yeah the architecture fits for me as well i wouldn't be surprised if we were somewhere around zagreb here um it almost looks a bit serbian as well but we don't have the google car but we'd probably also have some cyrillic in serbia so that's probably why i won't go there also actually i'm i'm actually quite confident that this is uh croatia because a lot of the time they have the blue fire extinguishers so or fire hydrants so there you go i think that is going to be the clue that tips me over here and yeah it kind of has a bit of a hungry vibe so i'm thinking of going actually even closer to hungary here maybe in this town here let's see and uh yeah that's a super good guess 27 kilometers away very very pleased with that 4927 you already know this is this is going very nice sometimes you gotta sit and wait a while before you make your guess and you may end up making a better one because of it so uh this one is good um let's take a look at these double your whites in the center um the fact that they are double white lines is uh very useful because obviously this is a very dry country and um there are parts of south america for example that would look similar to this but we can pretty much count out argentina and and well chile is also using white lines but this is not a particularly clean looking um outback and maybe uh by the fact that i've said it out back here you can guess that i i do think this is australia we've got some australian bullards here um with a red reflector and a silver reflector on the right hand side of the road uh we have these double um white lines this is a a thing that indicates how likely a fire is um so that's curious but this is i assume is actually the name of the town um i actually don't know where it is but um but it is the cradle of bulk handling maybe maybe this town is that um i think this is in western australia and the big reason for that is that we have this very kind of ready orangey brownie dirt like i would i would describe it as more brown but a bit orange and that's super typical of western australia also we know it's not south australia because we don't have stoby poles that are concrete here this is a wooden pole um what else is there to say um these ballads are you can't you can't really see it too well but these bollards in the distance have a black base and that's also more common uh in western australia so yeah feeling fairly confident so we could and i imagine some of you who are playing the challenge will actually go and find this but i think we're gonna be somewhere around here so i will give a quick scan um just in case um but i i don't think i want to um waste you guys time too much here um but i can see some similar looking names out of this direction so i wouldn't be surprised if we were somewhere out here so i think that is probably what we'll go for and this landscape is quite green so maybe even closer to perth um let's just go here and see how close we are and uh yeah there we are so that was actually a really nice guess again and we have ended up with 22 700 and if i have listened to myself a little bit more of that indonesia it could have been even higher so that was a really nice first seat and i hope you learnt a little bit there but the dirk paula was the main decider there for western australia so that is really good to keep in mind and it can save you from some bad guesses on the other side of australia i say let's get into the second link here also if you want this script i'll probably remember to put that in the description if i don't just uh comment but here is number two and uh yeah let's head straight into the game here okay so this one is looking rather japanese um well let's explain that because it's not entirely obvious off the bat here so this square car is probably the main one that's making me think japan off the bat um they just love square cars in japan and so if you haven't picked that up yet it's very common over there also it's like a short and thick plate that's also quite japanese oh this is like a i guess it's a japanese stop sign i've actually never considered but i think because it's red it must be a stop sign obviously quite different to a normal one in europe or elsewhere um this car is also driving on the left-hand side of the road which japan drives on and here again we have a square car and not to mention this one is square as well so it's funny japan like sends out all these different looking cars all around the world but back home they love the square ones and yeah we've got some yellow uh front plates here that is also consistent with japan um and so what else do we need to say here it's fairly flat it is fairly flat and i'm i'm i'm not actually sure if i think this is going to be north or south um i do see a pine here often the pines might be an indication of more northern but um yeah i don't think that's any guarantee at this stage um i think i'll just have to pick someone flat a little bit north so i'm thinking maybe somewhere over here um i'm really not sure let's go in this small town here but yeah not really too confident here we'll just have to see how close we are and uh yeah that's not a bad guess 170 kilometers away we were over on this side um and uh yeah not not bad not much to say about japan it's a tough country to guess inside of um here is a good little round we are using all white road lines here so that is good um obviously this one already felt quite european but if you were confused about it being canada or the us well we can already rule those out because of the um white road lands we've got a bunch of thin birch trees here which is good to know we have a snow pole here as well now i remember the getting a bit screwed up by my snow poles last time but i think this might be a finished snow pole um and and it goes orange all the way up and then a little white band and then orange again so i think that's also the case also this is a generation three camera um so it's not generation four and obviously in um or maybe not obviously if you're new but a lot of norwegian rounds is generation four so yeah um there's also yellowstone here which is furious i hope this isn't um sweden or anything but with this bollard i think the spotlight might be the uh finnish one so yeah i'm not all that confident but it should be fairly far north here i would not be surprised if we're about halfway up finland here and obviously we see some lakes as well so yeah i think that is pretty consistent with that area of the country and yeah it's a little further south but uh 4500 again very good effort i would say next one okay this one is a nice little one here plenty of clues to get it but uh if you don't know them obviously it's going to be a difficult one so let's take a look around i just figured out you can do this on the keyboard check it out oh you can't do it yeah there we go look look you can use a and d too look around anyhow so we have plenty of clues here let's observe it so we have an arrow here saying that we're driving left hand side of the road so already we are exiting out a lot of europe all continental europe is out of the picture here apart from malta the uk and ireland okay so you we also have this yellow line in the center though which is quite uncommon uh for left-hand drive countries i have to say most left-hand drive countries using all white road lines this one apparently not okay we also have an english sign here so that's very good clue as well we have white poles and a bollard with a red reflector even on the right hand side of the road using a red reflector so that is what we're working with here um and uh yeah here are some of the more of the upper odds there like split down the middle um and so what are we thinking guys well this one is going to be new zealand so we can already tell that by the bullets they're similar to the polish ones that we had earlier except thinner what's more we have these white poles that is very common in new zealand as opposed to australia they almost never paint the poles white in australia so that's a really good clue um it's hilly so obviously that is definitely consistent with new zealand and yeah sometimes in new zealand they do this white yellow line with the whites uh dotted next to it and you'll also see that in argentina in uruguay and in philippines sometimes and maybe some others as well but that's the main countries you'll see and uh that's basically all that all she wrote so i think somewhere in north island here although this could be easily be the north of the south island as well and uh yeah i don't know where that is so let's just go here and uh yeah this is another good guess it's on the north island and we have been pretty consistent here just getting about 150 kilometers away each time and uh just as i was talking about malta this one is looking like it's going to be malta and the biggest clue for multi is these rock walls they have rocklers everywhere and obviously there are other countries like that where they have rock walls as well like ireland and sometimes france as well but this one's more dry you can see we even have some cacti over here which you definitely see in malta as well so this one looking like a pretty surefire motor before we even look around it's kind of got like an australian style climate where it's very dry but also you do get some green grass as well and uh yeah i would be very surprised if this isn't malta although perhaps um sometimes you will get a similar type of round in um in sardinia or in sicily as well yet feeling pretty confident this is just going to be somewhere in rural malta not that there's much of it but uh yeah i don't know and also i'm not actually sure if this is going to be the north or the south island um but i'm just going to go south because there's more uh rural land there and yeah we are super close 4.2 kilometers away very nice and uh yeah we are on track for another good score here if we uh get this one right so here is this round uh this one has a number of good clues that we can get it from first off let's look at the pole it is actually all concrete so that is going to be a good clue it's not holy and it doesn't have any like um like uh doesn't have any like ladder um element to it you can't climb up it so that's good to know we have white outside road lines here uh here are some more of those poles over there it's quite a temperate looking climate not particularly uh would you say not particularly um tropical it's also hilly over here and the biggest clue is that we are here driving right and we have these plates with blue on both sides now see blue on both sides plates in france in italy and albania but you will only see these short ones these these uh normal european plates are about that long but these ones are a bit shorter but the blue on both sides definitely means we're in italy um so even albania which uses a very very similar color scheme um they would have the longer place on the front so yep has to be italy whereabouts is the question this actually is looking to be a bit of a difficult round if we check down for this valley not entirely obvious to me i think i'm just going to have to guess halfway up the country here um yeah maybe a little bit further south here don't mind that right there a bit a bit further south of rome could be up north i'm i'm not really sure here um let's just rip it in and see if i wrap and uh yeah this actually was a bit further north unfortunately first bad guess of the video really i would say um but uh there we go 22 220 so hopefully i'm still beating you guys um but if you're beating me good job um hopefully you're still learning a little something maybe on the australian runs and whatnot but uh yeah let's go into the next one i like to play about five here so let's uh we'll be you'll be able to see in the description how many there are but uh let's jump in to the next one put this right here and uh go in i'm enjoying this i hope you guys are too these ones tend to be like nice slow burners they uh they get a lot of views as as the time passes so yeah i hope maybe you're watching this a bit after it comes out and i hope you are enjoying so this one says motel um and we appear to be in russia that is cyrillic of course this is the l in cyrillic um so yeah russia is feeling most likely to me right here because we don't have to google card i suppose this could be um ukraine um but uh one sad thing or maybe depending on what you look at it as um is that ukraine tends to have very poor road quality like i mean really poor like i would say like 70 of the runs you have in ukraine they have just cracked roads everywhere this one is nice quality so thinking more of russia here um taking a look at these poles i have seen these these are black and white stripes sometimes around belarus in russia so i'm wondering about that right now uh we have these very long white plates with no strips so yeah that is definitely russian looking i can pretty much exclude every other country apart from russia and ukraine here and definitely reminding me more of russia out of the two in fact i think when you have these this letter instead of an eye um that is going to be in russia more likely and uh yeah the signs and everything like that definitely appear to be russian to me so yeah it could be ukraine seems unlikely to me uh so that is pretty much all we have to go off here we have like kind of this white dirt it's very flat so very very generic rush around i would say here and i just kind of want to test out this theory of going near belarus um because i think i have seen that kind of thing before um the the as i said these these little markings here but i could be wrong let's see about that theory and uh yeah this is actually near moscow so 4 000 points is actually a pretty good effort for russia but if you just went to moscow you would have had a really nice score uh unfortunate but as for a rush around that is actually pretty good and let's check out this round it's looking quite similar this time we have a really poor road quality but it doesn't necessarily strike me as ukraine either so let's check out what we got going on it's very um like it's very rural yeah i would say um this sign at the very bottom has a bit of black and uh that's something you definitely see a lot of the time in russia um let's check out this one so this car has a steering wheel on the right hand side of the car and that is obviously strange because we're driving right hand side of the road so the steering wheel should be on the left so this is actually an illegally imported car from japan presumably from a left-hand side drive country um because to avoid fees or import fees or something like that um and so we have a cafe in busco so i have a feeling that we're going to be somewhere near japan here and a lot of the time that will be in succulent and so i want to see if there's any place called oscar um because it's possible and then we could get a really crazy score here the coverage covers about half the island i think and i just want to see if there is any oscar uh it doesn't seem like there is but it was worth a little check here so it doesn't seem to be any oscar so let's take a look around for any other clues um the the disrepair of the road could certainly uh line up with um suckling here um as for the rest over here i do actually just want to see if there's any oscars because you know could that would actually make for a crazy crazy guess but i don't think we're going to be able to find it and of course you do actually get some of those um illegally imported cars over this side as well on um um kamchat kamchatsuki um peninsula over here but the the uh soil tends to be a bit darker over there in my experience so i'm thinking just of suckling here and maybe about halfway up the island um that's the petrol station it's very interesting these blue buildings so so interesting but yeah that's going to be the main clue here i think so yeah i'm just going to go somewhere over here i actually wouldn't mind finding a petrol station at least to go off of here um that one doesn't seem to be it just i just want any petrol station you know um because you don't want to waste you don't want to waste the opportunity for a good guess here so let's go right here um i don't think we're going to be right there but it's possible and okay this one was a i mean i'm fairly confident that i was right about that car let's go back in and see here um this steering wheel so indeed it was on the right hand side of the car and so that one was making a long distance and actually this is 2013 but it says corona on the front of the car there so that's curious um but yeah i feel a little bit there a thousand points only so quite likely that you may have been able to get a higher score than me there but that's just how geogaster goes sometimes huh okay so here is the next round this one is definitely looking interesting one thing that i'm noticing off the bat is there there are quite a few trees here i mean there's a few here but we can see this massive uh like expanse out here that has hardly any trees on it so i dare say that will be a clue um these arrows are pointing so that the car will drive up this way and they'll wait here so that appears to be a right-hand drive so that would definitely check out with what it looks like so far these crossings are interesting the fact that they're using um a yellow and blue kind of like swedish colors but i don't think sweden you would get this mountainous so at the moment what are you guys thinking i think because of this little accent over the year and just because of the general lack of trees that this is most likely to be somewhere in iceland so let's zoom in on some of these number plates and see if they have a blue strip because in iceland you're lacking the blue strip so this one appears to be missing it this one the sun has kind of washed it out so we couldn't really draw any good clues from it um and this one's a bit too far away as well also the single story houses whatever reason i do think they are more common in iceland also we have an a and an e stuck together here so we know it's not um sweden because they would use the umlaut instead and there's a church over there as well it's interesting not really a massive clue but it's just nice placement and look at those mountains so beautiful um so this will be another time to use the compass we can see that we've got a big bay to our south um and so i'm definitely thinking of this kind of area here although we have to be close to the mountains so what is this i think this might actually have a good shot of working so to our north we can see big mountains um so maybe even someone over here um i actually think this is not quite uh working out as a proper location unless we were like yeah hmm not entirely convinced not entirely convinced that we're right there so maybe somewhere over here instead i don't know you can really take a long time um iceland is a great country because you can really get those 5ks using the geography um but yeah essentially we've got like a fjord going along here and it kind of runs along a decent way so i don't know it's so doable but i also can't really be bothered so we're just going to go somewhere in here i think um this one doesn't really work we're just looking for something with the mountains to the north oh this one could work i don't want this um no it really doesn't unfortunately we have to have like a fjord um to our south so i don't know i don't know i just want something that vaguely works let's go for this one here this one at least somewhat has a chance of being correct and let's see okay so it was actually over the other side of the country and unfortunately if we could see a little bit further out here we would have gone a much better score but that is four thousand points so i'm sure some of you actually got a guest on the right side there my brain wasn't quite working at full capacity unfortunately that's okay so the next one uh we appear to be in generation two camera so one of the older camera generations and if you tuned in for the first two episodes of the series you remember i said the older camera generations tend to be in more wealthy countries the countries that got first priority when it came to street view um anyhow we have a straight edged o on the 30 zone here so that is definitely going to be interesting and definitely definitely a clue um pill knits is one of the towns here with this yellow sign are the plates do they have blue strips on them this one does certainly this one appears to as well so i have some thoughts here just i want to see here this says kunst um so that would be german for art potentially we could be in a german speaking country here this one says swiss collection or something like that so that is also curious so we've got a number of clues here we can probably just do this um based on the um language i think photo studio so i think i think or start dutch um yeah i'm actually not entirely sure it says stutton fart or something i don't know it's gonna be some tour bus and they appear to be speaking german here so these straight sided o's i think you often see them in austria i just can't remember at the moment whether we'd have this kind of sign in austria or not so let's get into the map here um can we find pill nits uh which is the name of this town apparently um i would like to be able to find that before i guess here um so pierna it could also be in switzerland now that i think of it in the german speaking side of it so i'm just trying to think this one is actually giving me a little bit of trouble i have to say the blue strips on the plates really mean that we're in austria but yeah not sure why are we speaking german could it be in belgium too now we'd see a bit of red on the normal place then obviously is a bit hilly so i think this is in austria i just don't think austria has that much gen too so yeah i just don't no it's not lints well uh my patience is starting to run thin so i think i will just go for i guess here somewhere over in lintz and uh we'll find out if we are incorrect or not and this one was in germany so i don't know why that gave me such a austria vibe um but yeah it was generation two i don't think they have any in uh in austria so that might have been a bit of a walking mistake there i don't know anyhow uh this was i guess it just like the the language part of it sounded a bit austrian i don't know why i just went for austria not a good guess there um but uh yeah i guess it was the hilliness as well that threw me off on the uh long side of the o but uh anyhow we are on to the next round here and uh this one is very dry super dry and we have like some eucalyptus type trees here so often when i'm seeing that with dry mountains i'm thinking of peru area in fact i do think like brew is definitely the main contender here without seeing the google car if we could see the guru car here if you were playing it you would see either a black or a white car i assume um other possibilities it's got to be something in the andes so i i guess like argentina and bolivia are also possible here it would be a very strange uh chili if we were there but i guess that is also possible this is enough light water definitely reminds me of peru as well so if i was saying peru i would say somewhere around where i put my marker here obviously we are following a river along a mountain range so something like this is well possible the mountains are pretty tall but maybe not as tall as what i've clicked in here so something more like this may be possible um yeah you do like to find one that is at least somewhat fitting so that could certainly work and yeah very dry so don't don't don't be confused um peru does get certainly dry on on this side of the again of this side of the andes so let's click and guess and a little bit further south here right basically right on the center of peru so 3770 and this one was a bit of a disaster we had the bad russia and we had i mean this one i didn't lose many points but i'm this is one of the worst guesses on the teaching series so far i think in fact probably the worst anyhow it is what it is um and uh i say we get back into another yeah so definitely going well i might leave it at four today i think we'll make this one the last one i'm starting to get a little bit uh mentally picked i think i mean that austria guess not so good okay so this is the next one we have white outside lines oh we have a blue barn a lot of things painted blue here that certainly acts as a clue for me i think um and actually you can see just on the edge of the nocar script they're here that we have a wide blur and that is often indicative of japan and sometimes taiwan and always switzerland so always japan and switzerland have um lokam and we have another one these squarish cars here so i'm thinking japan here also these because they have like quite tight roads in japan that often have these kind of orange mirrors you see a lot of them in europe as well but something that japan and taiwan particularly like to use i think um this one is fairly like poor i would say fairly rural and poor for japan although there are still some nice houses around uh so the question is where to go where to go um i can see it actually being further south here i'm not really sure why i think that when it comes to japan you have to play quite a lot and get a bit of a hunch for it um but we don't see the same pines that we did last time when it was a bit further north in fact we even see a um we even see a palm here so yeah that is why i think i really have to go somewhere on this island here and whereabouts i might go on issa yeah so let's see let's see if i'm right about that this one was actually in tokyo so i feel a little unlucky because of that palm tree but of course this is still tropical enough to be growing that kind of plant so it makes sense and uh yeah i'm starting to play as well as it was at start of the video i think anyhow this one is a right hand drive we have yellow outside lines unless the road lines as i like to say are probably the most important thing to check straight off the bat when you get into a round and the yellow outside lands something you see in south africa and the middle east and obviously this one not really so middle um south african looking not to mention the fact that we'd be driving left hand side of the road not right like this car is and we also have yellow plates and in the middle east with yellow plates we have to be in israel obviously sometimes you'll have like israeli cars driving in the west bank um and it's kind of rare to get gaza strip rams i don't think they have official coverage there um so yeah we should be in israel here and it's fairly dry we have look at all these terrorist farms here it's quite interesting looking uh but yeah i wouldn't be surprised if we were somewhere around nazareth or something like that or that we could be further south as well so let's get around nazareth and see and yeah this one was actually over in the west bank but a pretty close guess so 52 kilometers obviously a tiny country makes things nice and easy for us so estrada so this one is definitely appearing italian with this di off the bat that is that's something that you definitely see in italy in the italian language we're driving right hand side of the road here and you can see as i was mentioning earlier we got that short plate so that one's going to be a big clue here we've got all white road lines and uh yeah i think so you can see on the back plates they're longer with the two blues but can you see how it's a that's a big plate the long plates are much more typical of europe and north america actually uses short plates um but over here this long plate with the two blues is definitely a different length to this short plate on the front so yeah this is definitely italian i think more northern i think more northern here um but i'm not sure how north kind of reminds me a bit of montenegro so it could be here but i'm thinking more around bologna um yeah the the the climate kind of reminds me of croatia a bit as well actually so i'm actually happy with that guess let's uh let's see how we go and uh yeah that is actually pretty good near san marino so that's right actually about exactly the same latitude as croatia here glad i didn't go near montenegro and we end up that's that's a very respectable score i'll stay say so here is the penultimate round of the video and we have a blue and yellow flag here so perhaps letting us know that this might be sweden taking a look around um we have a sign here that says gatan and yes gathan means road in or something like that street in swedish so we should be in sweden here also um this like kind of red house is very scandinavian so if we didn't have the clues to get sweden here these kind of red this is like this is actually a brick house but this like red painted house over here is very very scandinavian looking oh this one feels fairly northern to me although i have been known to be quite wrong about those kind of things in the past or one other clue we've got over here is that these signs are filled in yellow and yes that is definitely a swedish thing to do also finnish also polish north macedonia greece a bunch of countries fill in their speed and give way signs in yellow but yeah that's certainly something they do a lot in sweden also this car and this car from i can tell these two cars these both hatchbacks are volvos and volvo's also manufactured in um sweden as well this is a volvo here as well so definitely they're driving a lot of their national car here so yeah this is beyond reasonable doubt in sweden and uh i don't know i'm feeling i'm feeling more north than stockholm but we'll find out this could even be even further north to be honest we'll see um and no it's actually further south so i'm glad i didn't go too far north um but we're in tibral uh a small town a respectable town i like the look of that i'd like to go there uh and so this is the final round of the video still reeling still reeling from that uh from that austria i guess can't believe i did that but uh yeah let's take a look around here uh this one we have a lot of red roofs we have some white uh actually the walls are painted white which is curious um it's kind of a little bit more tropical looking even though this should be european architecture so that's definitely something to take into consideration we have an a-frame poll here um but i'm not sure if this is a country that would normally use them to be honest so my my feelings at this stage is that this could be like either albania or greece the fact that it's so green makes me think of albania here quite honestly albania is like quite a poor and mountainous country and uh yeah i can definitely see like this kind of big mountain over here um being the kind of thing you'd see around maybe even tirana um tirana so maybe we could be up here on this hill or in in this hill over here looking down i mean the city would be to the north then um and we'd have a big mountain to the north so yeah that big mountain is direct north we can probably readjust i guess because of that um maybe in this part of town here then we could be over here looking at this mountain over here that's certainly possible um so i think that's probably what we'll go for here albania doesn't have a whole lot of coverage but we're gonna use the geography here um to get this guess also just the fact that it looks quite poor like this house kind of looks unfinished or abandoned or something like that and even though the architecture is really nice um yeah that is my thought at this stage it could still be like a portugal or something with how hilly it is and with the red roofs it could be spain could be greece um off chance of italy as well but i'm happy most with albania here and this was italy so yeah i was not um expecting it to be italy that but yeah this is actually the north in probably a rich area as well so actually quite surprised uh but without the car meta it can be difficult so yeah i'm actually not too uh displeased here we rank up to 38 we also got 19 000 points um and uh yeah i think i'll wrap it up there i didn't get too much sleep last night so that's why the guesses were a little off in this video but i hope it still helped anyway thank you very much for watching to the end if you really did i hope it really helped you um yeah some of the guesses were not ideal um but uh yeah we're kind of learning together that uh that those italian ones were screwing me up a little um but uh yeah thank you very much for watching to the end i'll see you guys in another video soon catch you later peace ", "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/ZkwtiS7vPsL3eMuu",

i'll be playing diverse world games and explaining my entire thought process meanwhile you guys will play along and hopefully by that you'll learn some tips and specific hints to try and get a lot better at the game and uh yeah it should be a fun one i i think these ones always have a positive reception so we're just gonna head straight into it i'm gonna make this a challenge and yeah hopefully i just make a really nice and full explanation of everything that goes into uh each of these guesses that i'm making so here's the first link hit that up in the description and let's head into the first round here i'm also going to be playing without the google car so hopefully that um provides some more sustainable hints for you than just relying on the car meta the first round here one thing that i'm noticing is we have a little bit of english here so that would probably lean me towards some countries and not others you wouldn't see so much english in latin america i would say so another thing to notice here is that we're driving right hand side of the road and most importantly perhaps is that this road is made of all concrete so normally you'd have bitumen but concrete roads are quite common for example in ecuador colombia philippines um sometimes thailand and sometimes chile as well so several countries using concrete birds like this but now if we zoom in over here we can also see that we've got a yellow line with white dashed between and next to it and so if we add all those clues together as well as all these palms in the quiet tropical climate this has to be on philippines so philippines one of the only countries i think it's the only country in asia that would do these road markings also the only country in asia that would have wide highways made of concrete as well in thailand you'll normally see thinner roads made of concrete so yep all adds up plus we're driving right hand side of the road so so many clues on this first round to be able to get there and to me this feels southern although i'm i'm always wrong so let's go on bohol here not really sure where it's going to be ends up being not too far away in penne so a decent score for the first round there mostly i'm trying to get the right country here but you know there will also be there will also be hopefully good some good scores as well okay so next one here we've got these kind of ones here are like these concrete poles they're definitely soviet style poles so they'll often be in a-frames or just stand alone like this one and they'll always be like a square shaped and sometimes they'll be a bit darker sometimes they'll be lighter like this one and then at the top you'll have like a kind of metal bar like that so countries where you can see that baltics ukraine russia kyrgyzstan um that's about all the ones i can think of where you'd have such poles like this uh so now we when now we continue to look at this so this one it feels like a decently full climate but also um quite foresty so i was thinking like russia near the baltics or maybe latvia or lithuania for this one um so i'm just trying to think so the houses kind of seem more western european like these ones don't really look typical russia that's probably the thing that makes me like baltics the most here um unfortunately so in a run like this what i'd really be trying to see if is if there are any blue strips on the plates this this plate here doesn't appear to have any blue strips um so that may indicate that we're actually in russia um that's a really good one if you don't have any car meta presumably for you guys you probably saw a long antenna or a short antenna um but because i can't rely on that then it makes it a little bit more difficult but um as for this speed sign i feel like with the um kind of lollipop design with the smaller text that's might be a russian thing but that's kind of something you have to learn by vibes so um basically in conclusion i do think we're probably going to be near the baltics in russia here so maybe this kind of direction it could always be out here as well and who knows it could be in asia as well i i'm not really sure but um yeah it feels a little bit too cold and like too like green um if you if you know what i mean like it's kind of this like colder climate i'm looking vegetation it feels too cold to be somewhere in ukraine i think um so yeah let's go for this and see how close we are and yes it was in russia so the number plate helps us over the edge there we're nice and petersburg so all the way near estonia there but a good effort nonetheless okay next one here we have some bollards so here's where bollard knowledge comes in handy but let's just pretend we didn't know what well ours these were and take a look around shall we okay so here here is another country that uses this uh single yellow line with the white dash so not many countries so let me tell you all the countries where you can see that so argentina doesn't sometimes uruguay does it sometimes um as we said philippines new zealand i'm just trying to think of any other country that does that i think you may be able to see it occasionally in south africa possibly although i can't quite remember i know i think they'd have another yellow on the outside so um or next to the white dashes so i think that is pretty much the four countries where you can see it at a good like frequency um if we look at this car here it's definitely parked as if it was driving on the left-hand side of the road um because like obviously if he's pulling out here um it's easier for him to get on the left now he could have done a u-turn like that so it's always possible but yeah just something to keep in mind hopefully he wasn't behind the webcam there but that's the one i was talking about um okay and then uh yeah so we've got the bollards um we've also got english writing on the road and crucially if you don't near bollards this this uh this uh sign post is painted white and there is nowhere in australia i think you might see where i'm going with this there's nowhere in australia that paints them white so we have to be in new zealand here and also these are the new zealand bollards they'll have the thick red on one side and then the red strip that's a better example here uh the red the white strip on the right hand side um or on the left hand side sorry okay so uh we're gonna be somewhere in new zealand here i think maybe north of the south island or somewhere in the north island i kind of like this kind of area here just because it is quite hilly and quite cold looking but yeah it could easily be north island i could even see it being quite far north but yeah new zealand not really my strong point in all honesty so i'm just going to go here ends up being south island indeed actually on this section so probably quite distinctive if you're good at new zealand but unfortunately i'm not that good uh anyway we get away with that one quite nicely okay so next one is one where we're really going to want to rely on architecture look at all these white buildings everywhere so um that is definitely the biggest clue here once you're an experienced geographer you won't notice these white buildings so let's zoom in on this sign here we have some arabic here that's for sure and then it's kind of hard to read this language i think it looks like some kind of romance language of course i think i do know what language it is but i'm just trying to like uh say say i didn't know i think i would have trouble reading that okay so taking a look around here um there's definitely a combination of like blue and white in the architecture very typical of this country also the center line in the road is white and also the outside lines are white as well which is super useful because a lot of the countries look similar similar to this we'll use some form of yellow lines and then zooming in over here and we have a follow car with the red on the on the registration plate um which is a government vehicle inside tunisia this is the tunisian follow car and this is also very tunisian architecture there's nowhere else where you'll really see anything quite like this i think um so then we get to picking a town here um when it comes to tunisia i like to this one's a little bit more difficult i would say because i think we're right near the ocean so um i could see us being here or something like that i'm not really sure if that town has coverage but it's probably going to be somewhere near the beach which is making it harder for me to judge the climate regardless it's definitely tunisia driving my hands out of the road all my road lines got the follow car got the houses so let's see if i close ends up being on this island okay that actually kind of makes sense i did consider it so yeah that's kind of the southernmost extent of the coverage in tunisia there's not really too much south of that and it goes all the way up to tunis but all this uh all these towns out here in the west of the country are not covered at all okay so we've gone decently so far nothing too insane but also good okay so here we have all white road lines once again that's a great thing to consider um let's check out these signs so this sign is set up for right hand drive you can tell that because as someone pulls up here they're going to be you know more so to the right because they're driving on the right side of the road going to left let people in driving right here and we know that because this sign is here on the right hand side so yeah just just a good thing to always keep in mind when you aren't quite sure you can't see any cars like this guy's a bit too far in the distance this guy yeah you could get fooled so it's it's good to rely on signs because they're almost always telling the truth okay so we got what white road lines here fairly flat which is interesting and we do have some hills in the distance um one of the big ones for this round particularly is that we're using a lot of metal um power lines here um we do we see some non-metal ones in the background but definitely a predominance of metal one metal one all the way through into the background over here and that's definitely a distinctive feature of this country another distinctive feature of this country is that we have like a pepperish road salt and pepper kind of road is what people like to call it and there are certain places in the world where you ha where you see this more for whatever reason um one of them we're not in texas right now but you do see it in kind of texas and oklahoma i think quite a bit for whatever reason seems to be a bit of a help for over there but clearly with these red roofs and everything we should be somewhere in asia and uh we got white soil as well and so uh let me let me get to uh telling you what it is so i do believe that this one is going to be turkey the all-white road lines this kind of texture in the road as well as these metal power lines which are very common in turkey you see them often decently off decently often enough in like serbia and bulgaria i want to say um and then also in some of the middle eastern countries as well but yeah israel definitely uses them a lot as well but i do think this one is going to be turkey because of all the all white road lines as well which you can only barely see really but yeah you can see that these are white on the outside uh whereas that would not be in israel for example so we've got to pick a flat part of turkey here so let's zoom in and find a part that kind of fits i can imagine this being somewhere over here it's fairly green so if we zoom out we can see how green the area we've picked is and uh not particularly green there so maybe we are actually just really close we could even be in european turkey here i think in fact i think that's what i like just because it's so flat and green and it kind of reminds me of bulgaria especially this house over here kind of gives me a bit of a bulgarian vibe but i could be totally wrong here and we end up being in bulgaria wow i uh was not expecting that the the the road itself looked very turkish to me so there you go but i did mention bulgaria also has quite a lot of those uh metal poles as well so uh definitely a tough round and so close to romania there but um yeah so i did say the house look bulgarian at least we guessed close to bulgaria so 21.2 uh is a decent score especially with the russia i think that was that was a very uh commendable effort but uh of course i i can only assume that some of you guys did better than me all right let's head into the next challenge here and uh hopefully uh we go well i like to make these ones a bit longer just so that you can chill out even if you're not playing along and just have a good time watching uh so here's the next one uh this one again has a number of clues so let's get straight into it so looking at this play over here unfortunately the sun is a bit too is a bit exposed on here but looking a lot of these plates they don't seem to have blue strips this one doesn't this one does okay so we've got kind of a combination of blue strips and no blue strips which uh you know there are some countries in which blue strips which which currently in 2022 use blue strips uh but which previously didn't and so it kind of seeps into the older google coverage because i can imagine this looks like gen 3 coverage so it was probably taken somewhere around 2015 around that kind of time so maybe they weren't fully transitioned at that point or something like that okay you got me uh so fairly hilly here so that that is definitely something to take into consideration as for the architecture kind of an interesting uh mix of signage here and and brick buildings as well as like kind of concreted buildings as well looking over here we have a a giveaway sign that's filled in yellow i think that is going to be a quite a a useful hint when we think about that later on because most countries use white give way signs okay climate feeling fairly cold one one thing that's a little concerning to me is that we have almost no language here and a lot of times for a round like this we would want some language we have a lot of birch trees though so that kind of gives it a colder vibe as well okay so let me let me tell you what my thoughts are here with a yellow fielding giveaway sign i think our our two real options here for this kind of round are poland and finland obviously they're quite far from one another but i'm still not entirely sure which country i want to go with just yet i think i was i was leaning finland as soon as i saw it um because we got like a volvo over here um and it just feels more finnish i would say but could easily be poland as well um so yeah i was thinking over here um so yeah they're two countries that use these yellow field in science as for countries that do that finland sweden poland sometimes north macedonia and greece that's the ones for europe um you've also got like uh i think south korea um iceland sometimes do it does it as well i mean we could be in iceland here but you don't see blue strips so shouldn't be iceland also too many trees so yeah it was never really going to be iceland actually so then i'm just trying to figure out which one i actually prefer here um obviously um neither finland nor poland are particularly mountainous but you can get hills in both finland's more flat than poland for example poland gets a lot of mountains in the south and then kind of just hilly in in different areas other than that but as for me i do think this is finland i could be wrong um if we were closer to this giveaway sign i'm sure we could work it out better but finland's another one of these countries as i said at the start of the round we sometimes don't have blue strips on some of the cars so that's why i'm going to go for it let's see if i'm right ends up being correct there so pretty happy with that i mean it was actually not all things considered not a particularly easy round i i did consider poland as a possibility there so but the trees in the end kind of felt more northern which is yeah just a vibes thing you kind of have to learn okay so even even though we have google car meta turned off here i can still say this is generation two by the peaking out of the blur here and that means we've got old coverage which is actually quite helpful for determining the country often now this one um i feel like i've had this round before and i thought it was either mexican well so let let's take it more slowly here so the sun appears to be to the south so we should be somewhere in the northern hemisphere um so that pretty much well a lot of the countries in the southern hemisphere have no generation 2 coverage anyway so we can rule out south africa and australia but not that they were particularly strong options anyway so these cars appear to be approaching us on the right hand side of the road so that um means we're somewhere up driving on the right here we have this yellow painted um bridge here which is really interesting and i remember last time i had this round that kind of fooled me a little bit so but let's let's continue looking here white in a line so the white inner lines should suggest that we're not in the americas chile uses white center lines but that's southern hemisphere and the sun doesn't fit that but the rest of these countries all through the americas tend to use yellow center lines um so that is probably going to rule those out now in basically every latin american country you can find exceptions um but in north america tends to be almost no exceptions at all um and looking here we have quite decent hills it feels like a mediterranean climate or at least a um somewhat of a temperate climate here fairly dry and these hills are quite distinctive i would say uh and so um i actually i'm pretty sure i had this round like a few weeks ago and i'm pretty sure it was greece and i was really annoyed at myself for guessing mexico but the reason i guess mexico is because of this painted bright painted bridge but i'm pretty sure that was just like a kind of out of place thing that they had in greece and you should trust the white center line don't be like me um so but i don't think i was concentrating particularly hard and it's not recalling i think this is fairly far north um of course repeat rounds can be a curse um but i'm pretty sure i'm right about that and so here you can see this sign this is another example of signs set up for right hand drive and another thing that people told me about uh greece is that the poles are often really tall and you can see that this pole is actually quite remarkably tall uh compared to your average pole i would say at least so i think that would also fit here so i'm pretty sure we are correct and so it's almost time to guess generation two um obviously uh greece being one of the only southern european countries to have gen two greece italy spain portugal they're the only ones really so let's guess see if i was right about that it ends up just being central greece that couldn't quite remember but that's fine okay so next one here uh we have some good language tips here but let's let's kind of run through everything else first so we have blue strips on the plates so blue strips on the plates don't get too confused because blue strips on the plate doesn't mean it has to be a country in the eu it just has to be kind of eu adjacent for example um iran actually has blue strips on their plates as well not the direct not they get that ngo guessing but um you can see it on the other maps as well um and uh so bearing that in mind so we're not in an eu country here's is kind of what i was trying to say um and we have we have a flag here so let's continue the round as if we hadn't seen that flag and we don't know what it is um so we've got concrete poles here which is interesting i i do think we would typically see more um more uh like as i said earlier in the video we would see more metal poles in turkey than concrete ones but looking around here we have ac with a hook on the bottom so the only countries i can think of that do that are turkey and romania i believe romania and romania has it with the s i think romania might has it would have it with the sea as well if they don't have it with a c then i think um i think uh portuguese does yes i'm pretty sure portuguese has it with the c maybe it's just with the s in romanian uh but regardless um you do see that in turkish as well obviously because we are in turkey here but good to remember that c um as for this kind of uh pavement quite common to see this kind of like brick pavement um in towns almost like a yeah yeah just kind of like a what you've got tiled road um and uh we have lots of like apartment buildings and definitely some countries do apartment buildings more than others and it just tends to be the way in turkey that most people live in apartment buildings and so you tend to see these big kind of three-story buildings at every corner really throughout the country so this is definitely useful what else is there to say here driving right hand side of the road um yeah i don't think there's really too much else to say here we have hills in the background but it feels fairly flat otherwise so it's kind of typical typical turkey i kind of want to guess somewhere like kanye or something like that kind of feels something to me but really not too sure here let's go in esparta uh ends up being a decent gas here we're over closer to the mediterranean sea but still decent 4.3 is good to me okay so here we have generation four lovely saturated coverage there's a number of clues here that are going to give us the country so let's run through them so we are driving right hand side of the road we can tell that by the car here now i we can see a number of bollards lining the side of the road now despite the fact that we do have yellow center lines here you would almost never see so many bollards in the u.s or canada they just tend to be two countries that don't use botlars nearly as much now you will see kind of similar looking bullards in the us but one two three four five in a row i don't really think you'd ever see that in us or at least it's quite rare to see it whereas in europe and australia and countries like that you see it all the time okay so these bollards have like a white reflector with black on it so these are unique to the country i believe or at least uh only unique to a few countries i'm pretty sure these ones are unique to this country turning around here we can see a car with a green registration plate that's a government vehicle it's got the blue strip and then the green plate if you can make that out over youtube we have hills here it feels fairly cold you have to say it's a fairly cold climate um we've got like kind of a lake here of some kind i think we can see that peeking through the trees and some kind of lakeside houses here okay and then yeah just a really good condition road that there's definitely something to be said about learning where the poor conditioned roads are like if you if you see a really poor condition road there's a really good chance you're in ukraine you know ukraine it's a country with a troubled past and not to mention the present and uh you know that that for that reason a lot of the infrastructure is quite poor so you often see poor quality roads in ukraine especially if we're talking about europe obviously africa has a lot of poor quality roads as well but when you see really high quality roads you might be thinking of a country like norway very very uh very very strong public you know um services and roads i don't think i've ever seen a bad quality road in in norway maybe once or twice but suffice to say it should be annoying here this is the only country in europe that uses any green plates for service vehicles like that they're normally going to be like bigger kind of mercedes or something like that bigger bigger truck kind of vehicles like this but not that kind of size if you know what i'm saying um and yeah so it's hilly fairly green i kind of like this area of the country could be all the way north as well i could easily imagine that but yeah i'm going to think like maybe we're near a lake but i don't feel like it's massive like i'm going to go somewhere like this it doesn't feel too far from oslo for my money so let's give that a go here and see but the yellow the yellow dash is there oh man i think that's about where i clicked unfortunately but um that's fine 4.6 is still great but yeah um um norway is one of the only countries in europe that uses yellow dashes on the center you have yellow dashes on the outside for um ireland and then double yellows occasionally in finland and finland is actually another one of those countries that uses a single yellow with white dashes as well next to it and like you likely saw in philippines so that's one i forgot to mention okay so here we go we have um this is this is an interesting one we've got a concrete pole here um generation two coverage we can see that from the wide blur again a bit of language here but we can ignore that for the moment because i'm i'm sure a lot of you guys have decent language grasp already this one is hilly uh so at this stage i would love to see some kind of a car number plate because that would really help me out um regardless it doesn't seem like we're gonna be able to get that this house is made of bricks so when you see exposed bricks in europe you could say like northern france luxembourg belgium netherlands and the uk are really where you're gonna see a lot of express bricks sometimes germany as well and denmark okay so that's kind of like the belt uh like kind of this v shape of where you're gonna find a lot of brick houses elsewhere in europe not all too common you do see them but not all too common okay so we have a concrete pole here this one's got like a lot of metal bands around it i feel like you see that a lot in like france belgium luxembourg area i don't really consider that the other european countries use these kind of metal bounds around around a concrete pole too much but that could be wrong not only too sure so this language kind of appears french however i do have some reservations looking down at these houses over here well they certainly could be french the kind of black slate roofs definitely also reminds me of luxembourg and we can see we've got rolling hills here so the fact that we see both of those may indicate that luxembourg is also a strong possibility here it's not to mention that it feels like a fairly affluent area and the north of france as far as i know here is not the richest area which is where i'd place it for france whereas luxembourg is a wealthy country so not really sure if that's actually a good line of logic but it's something i'm thinking about at the moment luxembourg tends to get uh helium in the north and and flatter in the south so i'm thinking north luxembourg here of course this could be like france near strasbourg or something like that or even just over here well possible okay so that's pretty much what we're working with here um i don't think there's any specific country hint here so we may actually lose that streak it's well possible um but uh that's kind of what i'm thinking here is here's a good example of that black slate roof that i was talking about which is common in luxembourg so i think we'll just go for the guess here it's going to be one of the two i assume uh but that's pretty much it there's not actually not too much going on here so let's see if i'm right ends up being 66 kilometers over the border in belgium not entirely surprised there to be honest um but at least we kind of picked up the vibe now that that house so this one would be like very typical of south belgium but not of the north in the north of belgium and basically the rest of the country kind of cutting off from the hilly part down here you would see much more red brick whereas in this one we saw a little white brick so i'm not entirely surprised that we're over the border here but still a decent score 22.5 actually that was all europe we played europe well it was asia here but we we almost got the full europe seed and we get 22.5 to show for it losing our country streak but guys i say we do for one more here um and uh hopefully i i beat some of you guys at that one i i'd like to think that that was a decent game especially for no kanji compass but yeah giving those country streaks is tough on this on this uh map and this mode okay so here is a good little round i like this one should be an interesting get see if we can get see if we can win a bit of a 50 50 yeah okay so here now we've got a bit more bollard guess so if you know your bars this round does become significantly easier but actually there's a number of things that i can tell you guys about this round okay so first off we've got a chevron here uh red and white red on white is the most common chevron type in europe there are so many countries especially in eastern europe that use this for example um like croatia romania turkey i believe hungary slovakia czechia um and then a lot of the kind of um ex-soviet countries in in kind of the more russian sphere of influence use a white on red as opposed to red and white um so you can distinguish them that way i'll flash up a map if not um someone remind me and i'll put it inside the description but yeah that is that's definitely worth learning these chevrons for example um there's there's also like you can also get yellow on black which is in portugal ireland uh norway and uh luxembourg i can't remember which the other one is that uses those but you know it's where it's supposed to say very useful to learn those but here we have the bollard with the two orange reflectors this is only in two countries and those are slovakia and czechia so we've already narrowed down mostly using this bollard but say we didn't have the blood we could also narrow it down to some kind of eastern european country most likely with this one here okay but now let's uh let's look at this guard rail which also had which also has like a flat edge and a wide gap between and i'm pretty sure this one if not exclusive is most commonly found in czechia and slovakia so czechoslovakia are cheeky because they they tend to use all the same things and it makes it very very difficult to uh tell the difference okay this is generation three coverage by the way uh which you would which you would see in both countries whereas generation four would only really be seen in czechia um by borrowing a few tiny examples so yeah we should be somewhere in either of the countries as we've established okay so then uh we um i guess we i guess we look a bit further around and see if there's anything else here this one is definitely hilly but not in a way that kind of tells me one or the other i guess as a rule like slovakia is more mountainous but you do get tons of hills in czechia as well i think at this point i do actually prefer slovakia but it's not it's just a vibe thing at this at this stage there's not anything that would really tell me one way or the other and i'm very prepared to say that it could easily be checkier also we've got a skoda here and scrotas are quite common in both countries made around there and also we have all white road lines obviously typical for europe if you if you didn't know that yet and blue strip on the plate so it'll it all checks out that's for sure um just trying to think of where i actually want to put this one but yeah as for me i think i think just somewhere well i might just click near the border as a bit of a hedge sometimes you've got sometimes you've just got a hedge in geoguessing i feel like that's that's kind of right now um road quality is very good here i don't really know if i could use that to swing my decision one way or the other might feel a bit more western european but you could certainly see it in either country there's no doubt about that i might actually go check you here i might um but yeah i'm still going to click near the border here just because i'm i'm pretty i'm pretty pretty hopeless when it comes to this 50 50. so let's find out shall we uh ends up being 32 kilometers away so a good switch a good switch there really nice score um plenty of clues to get that one off of but um we end up getting a nice guess as well which is fantastic okay here's the next one here um very dry round off the bat um will we see any cacti here i don't see any but i wouldn't have been surprised to have to be honest um we got a painted front of the house here quite typical for latin america you could say um taking a look at these houses a lot of them like kind of made of mud bricks as well also also decently typical for the area of the world as well we've got hills in the background here definitely worth paying attention to um so we can pretty much rule out a country like uruguay where you would not have any hills that size um so that's good now let's check the sun so sun it seems to be more so to the south however it is almost midday so it is quite hard to tell whether the sun is to the north or to the south i would say it's more so south uh looking just ahead of us here we have what what i would call an octagonal pole um you can see one two three sides here but i assume this one would actually be either hexagonal or octagonal probably octagonal it's also got some writing on the side of it as well and so countries that use octagonal poles mexico is the big one mexico you will see octagonal poles very uh very commonly um colombia also you occasionally see octagonal poles and i feel like i've seen them in ecuador too if not similar ones now this round could have been difficult by the by the fact that we have clear satellite dishes which are much more common in brazil however i'm thinking this one's mexico and i do think that you would kind of see that kind of thing in rural mexico as well so satellite dishes that are clear common in brazil i think you also get them quite a lot in indonesia and malaysia maybe thailand too i think that they're some of the other countries where you'll see such satellite dishes but the big one here is the the octagonal pole and the architecture as well i would say these kind of white buildings more common for mexico so it has to be fairly dry here but also i don't really feel like it is too far north either because of the kind of whitishness of the soil i feel like it would be a little more red up here so then i'm just kind of thinking like somewhere in the dryer zones out here would kind of make sense to me otherwise we could be a little bit further over this direction and that's kind of the two things i'm really thinking here um but yeah i think i think i think this would be a chill guess regardless we're going to be decently close sarakin we're 40 kilometers away so this has been an actual actual nut start to the seed very very very happy with these guesses um and so there we were oh this has been a really nice start see what we get on the next one especially for um no car no compass okay so next one here we are aided by a number of things we're driving our hands out of the road first thing to tick off the list um okay so we've got a bit of a donate domain name here so that will definitely help out um okay so let's just run through some of the things here this architecture i would say is very like typical of czechia slovakia and serbia um yeah definitely those three countries would come to mind when when i see uh around like this also we have these round poles round concrete poles are also very common in all three countries maybe particularly check your own slovakia they love to use them over there so no holy poles or anything anything in those three countries at all okay so then uh let's check out the kind of um what i want to say next i think this sign is quite common in eastern europe this one you also see a lot in turkey and south africa and the south african countries um okay so uh the houses are also going right to the um footpath here so like like these four houses in a row here that's something that is typical for all three countries as well very common in serbia but obviously with the sk domain name we are in slovakia this time so i may have been tempted to go serbia um had we not had that indeed i probably would have to be honest um so let's see if we see any hills that looks like it's probably just trees so we have to be in in a rather flat part of slovakia here i would say we're going to be far south i would say we're going to be far south in a town like that maybe um we might even have the town name here not that i'll try and find it but yeah don't don't really see it not to worry not to worry okay so yeah definitely feeling slovakia um there's not really too much else to say here just just a very like european breakdown of cars all the cars are european very it's just very eastern european vibes you kind of have to know it um a lot of single-story houses but then also apartments in the background i would say that this is just super typical um slovakia and so i think like a southern guest the only thing atypical about this round is the flatness but we can just guess in a flat region like near bratislava and we're going to be 98 kilometers away so it's still a decent gas here in malaki so right near the border there with austria interestingly and i did kind of think some of the houses looked a little austrian but um or more so western european but you know it's hard to get those fabs sometimes as well okay next one's interesting here so we're driving right hand side of the road with double yellows in the center here we also see them here yeah we do um so let's ignore the signs just for now so we have like uh interestingly we have some like eucalyptus trees here um which is not yeah and this one true this one too not not entirely typical of this country but certainly something you can see here um okay as for um what else can we say here we got like a lot of american cars here this is a very good way to tell this country apart from others so look pick up american pickup truck here here here um [Music] yeah we see three at least so yeah and that's pretty typical that one might be asian but yeah it is very typical to see these kind of american pickup trucks in mexico of course we are in mexico this time um and we got generation four coverage as well which you can see in mexico colombia argentina and brazil at time of recording uh we also have hills in the background and mexico is kind of it's very it's one it's a certain kind of country where it grows flat and then heals and then flat and then hills and that's kind of so so you you'll normally be in a flat area but be able to see hills in the background or something like that okay we're also near plucks flux carla which i have heard the name of i was thinking it's further over this direction but um maybe i'm wrong about that well because run such a good score i do actually want to find this of course um so flux color um that's probably what i was thinking of tukstla um but yeah this one should should not be too hot i've definitely heard of this place we're given that sohili we shouldn't be anywhere in yucatan yucatan and kampachi are pretty uh pretty flat areas so over this direction here then okay so let's see what number they were seems like it might say 130. so we're in 170s over here 125. so wouldn't be surprised if we were nearby here i don't see it okay so so here here's tox um here's here's the state we're in it's a very small state so we're guaranteed a good score for that reason okay we're on an overpass with a road underneath it that basically goes directly north to south so this one's certainly gettable oh it doesn't bend at all from what i saw no so we got a hill to the north as well so this is certainly certainly findable and that's why kind of why i just want to give it a quick look at least um yeah that's too built up we when we're kind of outside of a town here um and would that be a yellow road it's probably just a white road that's going to make things harder to see whereas this one would appear to be a yellow road on the map i imagine so yeah it might be a little too hard to find i don't really know if we're going to be able to but i mean regardless we're going to get good school i would not be surprised if we're just outside um down here maybe we can use the other the other town name to help us out puebla so where's puebla oh there it is so so we're probably between the two towns in fact there so so puebla is kind of kind of east of us and so maybe southeast and then so we're probably like somewhere between the two towns so play something like over here so do we see any road that runs north i don't know because it's a longer video i'm kind of comfortable with trying to get the 5k that almost looks similar but it has to be north to south you see i have to be running this direction i don't really see any good candidates to be honest also our road kind of is running more east to west than the one i clicked on so i don't know if we are actually going to find the one here okay well that's it for searching for me let's go right there and we end up being 14 kilometers away this was the one okay so there we go that's what that's what we're on it wasn't quite directly north to south but 14 kilometers away is still a great score and we can get 24.5 here looks like we actually will as well because we are in a small country here okay so here we go white center lines very faded yellow outlines this car would appear to be driving left at the top as well so that pretty much cuts out the other countries that use yellows on the outsides jordan israel and uae okay so we're looking down in this region here it's very green with a lot of hills so botswana is immediately out the only hilly region is around gabarone you see hills here but yeah it would be too dry there anyway so south africa lesotho s martini um lesotho would never have this many trees i'm quite confident in saying when you see proper forests like this like this one here never lusudu i want to say that at least very very rarely if so okay so then we're down to south africa and this martini um and well with these big pine forests you see these big pine plantations and these big hills when you see that combination it pretty much has to be on the s martini south africa border and uh as for this one because this kind of long yellowish grass i really like swatini better and so i think we're going to be somewhere on the mr19 somewhere around the border here near embabani so i think that's pretty much what we're what we're dealing with here now again because i'm on such a high school i could probably find like like a way that it you know that that fits this road i mean to be honest where i've clicked right now doesn't even seem too bad um if we're going there then it's going to bend away too yeah not not not correct but i i do strongly believe that yeah we're going to be one near one of these kind of green sections here in the west of s martini uh she also might be wearing traditional dress which would be more common in swatini um and uh these kind of straight wooden poles i i think also more common there i'm i'm quite confident also with this red soil that we are on there teens out of the border rather than south africa but regardless we're gonna be close uh and so guys i think i think we're gonna go for it here also the kind of vast hills this is also a very hilly area so you can just see the rolling hills way into the distance there to the north um which yeah would check out we can we see a lot of hills rolling over to the north there so let's go for this guess and we end up being okay not too far away but actually quite a bit further north than i thought so we get 24 348 there we go not not a particularly difficult seed because both of the mexican rounds had signs did they not i think they did no no this one this one was more of a vibes guest so i i have a sneaking suspicion that even without the car even without the google car there i will be the top scorer so we'll see if my suspicion is correct regardless it's a pretty easy seed and a good way to finish off the video guys thank you very much for watching i'll see you guys in a very this video very soon and i hope you guys learned something do leave a comment smash like as well and yeah until next time goodbye ", "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/Pa4VzJtr1buUctLf",

"transcript": "what's good everyone it's zigzag here welcome back to another geo guest video good to have you along on the channel today so today we're going to be playing some community world on a play along and the idea is that you're going to play these seeds first and then i'm going to teach you guys what i know about the different matters that we're going to see in these rounds and all the different tips and tricks that you can use to up your level of gameplay i hope by watching this video you'll at least learn some things hopefully in every location i'll be able to teach you at least two or three so let's get straight into this first link which is found in the description hopefully you've played it by now and uh let's see what we got going on i've also blurred out the car so that we are not using that to decide where we're going to go because a lot of people like to learn the actual tips rather than just the car meta here is the first one this architecture strikes me as quite southeast asian off the bat also we have a whole bunch of motorbikes motorbikes are fairly common in latin america as well but certainly the part of the world where you see them the most is southeast asia particularly you could say like indonesia malaysia thailand that kind of area there okay so we see plenty of those scooters and bikes right now so let's take a look around here we've got a mix of like what appears to be arabic and also what appears to be some kind of latin script language as well here which is interesting interesting indeed oh this girl is wearing a head scarf as well so that would definitely factor into our guess later down the track okay so just looking for anything let's have a flag here so that will probably help as well at some point okay so we're fairly built up here which is interesting um again we have the flag painted on um the pulse here so this will be indonesia and indonesia is a very patriotic country so you'll often see that around the spot here okay so let's take one more look okay here's here's a very uh important thing to know for indonesia is that oftentimes they'll have cigarette ads all around the place and the price is normally around 15 000 i think it's root rupees over there so i'm pretty sure that's what they use in uh it starts with an i i think it starts with an r anyway um and and it's normally going to be about 15 000 somewhere in that ballpark 16 000 is also pretty common for the price of cigarettes so you can often use that as a pretty good way to tell indonesia because that's the only country using that um uh currency so yeah um we also have this kind of very very indo slash malay looking language here so yeah obviously that is going to be pretty nice um the question is where it kind of reminded me of borneo a little bit it also kind of reminded me of sulawesi so i'm kind of tossing up between those two seeing if there's any i've learned i know the phone codes for indonesia but i don't think we're actually going to get any or offer here so yeah uh and then polls are also quite useful but i don't think we see any as well so then actually the longer i look at it the more i kind of like just going java here um i could easily see sulawesi or any any any uh island here but i think i will just go java so let's find out where it actually is and it ends up being all the way up here so well done if you are able to get sumatra unfortunately because it was so urban um i couldn't get it although i'm sure if you're an indonesian expert you could have so starting off with a low score but hopefully you learned some stuff about indonesia and uh here we are and uh this one would appear to be in a similar type of region of the world let's say okay so let's take a look at what we see on this one we see all white road lines it's going to be very significant for helping us decide where to go we also have a black and white signposts which will also help factor in for the country here um it's quite apparent that we are driving left-hand side of the road here even though this this whole like pulling over section over here this car is driving on the left-hand side of the road and you can see this sign is set up for left-hand drive this is the back of the sign the cars for their headlights facing us here we'll drive down the road and they'll be able to see this sign facing towards them okay so that's pretty useful um vegetation wise we also have a whole bunch of oil palms here oil palms very common in indonesia particularly borneo and likewise maybe even more common in malaysia um also common in southern thailand as well i'm pretty sure that's the extent of where they're very commonly found so good to keep that in mind okay and then we also have a black number plate which is divided in two here we have one set of text here one set of text here wide black number plate if this were in indonesia which it's not then we would have three sets of text as it stands we only have two and so that would that would indicate that we are in malaysia okay so yeah all white road lines as well very malaysian and oftentimes you'll have a double white line um in the center double white line but we don't have that here if you do have that and you're in asia i'm pretty sure malaysia's the only country in asia that uses double whites at least the only country that commonly does it so um yeah we should be on borneo here and the reason i say that is because we're in generation three camera which is more common in borneo and we also have all these oil palms which are also more common in borneo and it's very flat as well whereas peninsula malaysia tends to be quite hilly all the way through so i would say we're somewhere around here maybe i'm just trying to think actually how far up i want to go here maybe it could be somewhere around here it's probably going to be somewhere between here and over here and so i'm just going to go for that and it ends up being 200 kilometers away other side of bintulu so not a bad effort there although no doubt as well some of you guys got better scores okay on to the next round here let's check out what we've got going on uh okay so we have some language here we'll return to that at some point soon okay so we have holy poles over here that's definitely going to factor into our decision later on you'd call this one a wide holy pole um and there are three countries in europe that tend to use holy poles very often and there's a hungry romania and poland you can also find holy polls of some description in france and belgium and then also occasionally in portugal although portuguese one's a bit different and then elsewhere in eastern europe as well okay so that's kind of what we're working with here okay we are fairly hilly but not all too hilly um one also one also thing to mention about this holy pool here is that it's painted white at the bottom which will also factor into our decision later on as well okay so we have some bollards here these are in the australian style this is an australian style bowl a little bit shorter so you'd find this kind of a board in in the netherlands as well although of course we're not there because with mountains like this these would easily exceed the highest point in the netherlands okay and then uh we also have some architecture here which will come in useful architecture kind of the thing you need to get like your own feel for by playing a lot but i would definitely say that that's useful here and also the white center lines should guarantee that we're in europe as opposed to elsewhere okay so i'm coming to my decision here given the fact that a lot of the trees are painted right at the bottom as well as this wide holy pole here i think this should be in romania so let's uh take a look at this sign here to confirm that we're speaking some kind of romance language and we are we can see the de uh kind of word here that would that would definitely remind me of a romance language such as like italian or french or something like that but of course we're in eastern europe so this one will be romania this architecture here kind of reminded me more of like hungary or slovakia or serbia so i was thinking of guessing this side of the country uh who knows if that's going to be correct or not that's kind of my own thinking on the round though and uh yeah that's about it i mean these bars these are not typical for romania although you can find them there so i think that's about all we need to mention here let's guess it and it ends up being 155 kilometers away so a pretty nice effort there okay next one here uh seems that we are continuing on with the theme of the first two rounds from this video so here we are using a concrete road this is probably the biggest clue on around like this concrete roads around the world fairly common in philippines in thailand um you can find concrete roads fairly often in like peru ecuador and colombia as well uh bolivia i believe every now and again uses some concrete roads as well i'm just trying to think of other countries where where concrete reds are fairly prevalent but yeah these ones in southeast asia are particularly where you'll see a lot of them and now in thailand you wouldn't see so many concrete roads that are indonesia i forgot to mention as well uh thailand you wouldn't see so many concrete roads that are double land uh whereas in philippines you would see them quite often so philippines immediately coming to mind here okay so we have some like banana plants here very common all over southeast asia that's for sure we also have these red and white chevrons here now i can't claim to know my chevrons of asia that well i know them pretty much all in europe but as for these chevrons you can definitely see red and white in philippines and it's quite useful i think you'll also see red and white in sri lanka um and probably some others as well although i think all the ones in all the other like proper possibilities would not be a factor with red and white i believe also clearly we're driving right hand side of the road and so that cuts out uh thailand cambodia japan malaysia indonesia i'm not cambridge sir but you know um and so yeah plenty of countries that drive left-hand side of the road okay so all that having been said we seem to be quite high up here and so the tallest mountains in malaysia i mean in philippines i would say somewhere up here so that's really what i'm thinking of guessing although it could just be a really wet day and that's why it looks so elevated and so is there anything else to say here um we also have a bit of english which is very typical to see in the philippines and uh we do probably have the location of where we are here but i can't be bothered actually pinpointing on a teaching video well all white road lines is interesting as well um because sometimes you would see yellows in in philippines unfortunately this was all the way far south um it's interesting because i seem to be able to get the middle of the country quite well but then i often confuse north and south with one another so unfortunate result there but we do fine okay so the next one here we are on full country streak let's see if we can continue on that theme this one we're immediately going to look at the road lines obviously i'm always harping on about road lines in this series but i really do think it's so important that you learn where we'll have yellow in the center and when we'll have white in the center and so we appear to have double yellow lines in the center here which would mean somewhere in the americas is immediately much much more likely so the only country that where you would never see like double yellow lines like this is like chile where you'd have double white lines and then some of these countries like peru ecuador colombia mexico are more likely to use a single yellow line in the center but still most you'll be able to find double yellows as well okay let's take a look at the poles next these poles are sectioned they have three sections in them they have dots towards the top and they're completely made of concrete so perhaps that rings a bell for you if it does then um then you should know the country if it doesn't then keep keep the image of this pole in your mind because it is one of the more useful polls to know in the whole geography i would say and so we have red roofs on a lot of the buildings as well this would probably indicate some european influence i think it's fair to say we also have a lot of motorbikes as i said motorbikes can be found quite often in south america this one does not really feel like southeast asia in fact the only countries you'd see double yellows in southeast asia would be like taiwan just trying to think i think maybe in some times in cambodia you'd see or maybe sometimes in thailand as well but yeah not particularly common thing to see in southeast asia okay so i am thinking with these uh concrete section poles that we should be somewhere in brazil now brazil uses these poles all around the country you can see fairly similar ones with shorter sections in them in ecuador and then brazil is a pretty good good uh a good call when you see a pole like this in south america also to mention we have these clear satellite dishes very common for roofs of brazilian houses and so the question is where and um with these hills i am kind of liking north a lot of red roofs and kind of dis-shaped hills in the north of the country um i could as easily see it being somewhere like much further out here i could also see it being you know somewhere in goyas or tokantins as well but yeah i mean um i uh i think we should be correct here and so i'm just trying to see if there's anything else that's particularly useful a lot of motorbikes and i think that may indicate that we're in a poorer area and this is kind of a poor area as opposed to the deep south which is quite more or quite a bit more wealthy in brazil um but i think that's about all i can see the double yellows in the center those concrete poles here and kind of this just general landscape and feel is quite brazilian indeed so let's see if i'm right about where it is it ends up being a nice guess in uh so i don't really know if i'm pronouncing that correctly but there we go in 18 000 so by no means a terrifically high score especially because my philippines guess left a lot to be desired but i i think that was a good one so let's head into the second challenge link now and the hope for a another seed where we can uh just run through some of the more important things here so um yeah let's get that one click that in the description play it before you move on to this one let's see how we go okay here so first one here is immediately giving me a certain vibe so we should be in generation two camera here now generation two camera is the coverage taken about a decade and a few years ago 12 13 years ago and uh yeah yeah about that long ago almost and uh we should be in somewhere in western europe for that reason eastern europe did not get much generation two coverage there's not too much generation 2 in the united states interestingly although mexico and canada have quite a bit of it south america is largely devoid of generation 2 apart from a little bit in brazil and maybe colombia as well i think and yeah and then australia new zealand have it but this is a european start sign here and uh yeah i mean actually you may be able to see a single sign in new zealand but regardless i'm pretty sure with this climate we shouldn't be there okay and then south africa also has gen 2 as well so um yeah let's check out what we've got going on here seems like some oak trees or something like that a lot of fruit bushes as well this is the first video round of the video where i'm not entirely sure of the country although i'm pretty sure we're gonna be able to get there um i hope anyway okay so we do have a a mountain or a volcano over there which is really interesting we have another red tiled roof we also have an olive tree here or something regardless it might not be an olive tree but it's very mediterranean looking so i'd immediately start thinking about those types of countries but anyway portugal all the way through to greece here greece is another country that has a lot of generation two camera um these poles here do appear to have the color of being concrete especially this one here i would say and uh greece tends to use wooden balls so we can probably cut grease out here at least tentatively um so we're on a fairly it feels like a warm climber i would say um it definitely it definitely does not feel too cold and with this and this this uh concrete pole does feel round to me and um so i'm thinking italy and now let me let let you know of the thing that most makes me think of italy which is this kind of dark back to this sign and now dark backs to science can be found in many countries in europe but it's especially prevalent in italy albania and romania they're the three countries we can reliably have it now north macedonia i mean i've seen fairly grey looking ones in poland just today and in many other places but uh generally speaking when you have a darker back of the sun like this italy is a good shout and of the countries that we mentioned romania has extremely rare gen 2 and north pacific has no generation two so italy is the go right okay so fairly mountainous over this direction i don't have the compass enabled because that's what the uh cast group gets rid of i think it's actually k we can bring back the compass okay so like the uh kind of mountain or volcano to our south and then over to our east we also have some mountain range as well so um i'm just going to guess kind of somewhere over here but i dare say that we are going to be somewhere in like central southern italy here so let's see and it ends up being a nice guest right near rome there so we will take that okay so hopefully that black back of the sign helped you guys out there next one more on a bridge so this one this one may prove a little bit more of a challenge um okay so next one so we have a single yellow line in the center of the road um single yellow lines okay so um quite commonly found in thailand cambodia and indonesia i would say um let's take a look at where this car was driving so this car is driving right hand side of the road so we can actually eliminate all but cambodia there okay i'm moving over to south america i already mentioned earlier in the video that you often see a single yellow line in bolivia um peru actually i'm not sure how common it is in bolivia made brew ecuador uh colombia guatemala mexico okay and i am thinking um that this truck here this pickup truck kind of looks more like one that will be made in the united states and when you see a truck like that then mexico and guatemala have got to come to mind you often see quite a lot in ecuador a lot as well in my opinion in my experience but uh um i i definitely think that when you see a truck like that mexico and what have got to come to mind for you also this might be an american car as well come to think of it um as for architecture here there's not too much going on uh it's very lush it's very green so a lot of mexico is surprisingly dry and so we can we can definitely chop off maybe the first half of mexico here and so that's probably not a possibility also the sun here is to the south so that would indicate northern hemisphere most likely i mean it's not directly to the south but it's definitely more so to the south so i would feel fairly confident using that hint here okay so because we can't see the google car generally speaking when you can see the google car you can see the the silver car with the with the rear view mirrors which um would probably be visible here if we are in guatemala which i have a feeling we might be um if not if you're not using the uh google car meta and it can be quite difficult to distinguish the two countries but essentially we've got a fairly mountainous landscape here and we are fairly tropical and we have this single yellow line as i said both countries use i would be leaning towards what here but i i could certainly see a southern mexico even something along the coasts here either side where it's a bit greener is also certainly possible we have a political poster here i feel like both countries you do see them and but i'm i'm relatively confident that it is north america here so we may lose our six country streak here it's possible but i will go for guatemala uh let's see if we correct about that and so it was guatemala just on the mexican border this is kind of the the region i expected it to be in and so we uh we end up surviving yet again and so we are sitting on a seven country stream here going quite nicely okay the next one here plenty of clues but let's let's try and break it down here for ourselves okay so first things to notice road lines always always look down for the road lines first we are using all white road lines here including a double wire in the center and that is going to be very useful indeed in fact will be one of the deciding factors in our guess here we're driving right hand side of the road so assuming that we are you know in europe which i mean the architecture looks very european indeed i think it's fair to say then uh we should not be in united kingdom ireland malta and cyprus as well although there's no uh coverage there okay so that is uh they're the places that drive left so we've got a blue strip on the plate as well so probably not russia probably not ukraine generally speaking two countries that don't use blue strips on plate um and so then we are kind of thinking about you know mainland continental standard europe here okay so let's break down some of the things that we could use to get the country here and i'll reveal to you that the country is poland okay so why is it poland we have this concrete pole here with the with the uh kind of um oval holes in it here and these ones are are the polish variants where they don't go all the way to the ground whereas in um in for example hungary and romania normally the holes would go all the way out into the ground whereas on this one they cut off before the end and before the top so that is quite a polish pole indeed um we also have double whites in the center of the road here and for whatever reason on a on many roads around europe you'll find up whites don't get me wrong but on a thinner road like this where it's kind of like it's quite suburban like why would you really have a double line here generally speaking which means no overtaking um well you have one here and and and you have those quite often on thinner roads in poland i think denmark is another country that has a very uh has a ponchon for these uh double white lions where else do i often see them um greece often has them and they're often faded in greece as well so that's three countries where you often see them where you might not expect to see them in other countries okay of course you do see them in other countries but in in zones where you might not see them in other countries okay i can also think of two other things for poland here here's a pedestrian crossing and here you don't have any straps on it in poland you won't have any straps on the pedestrian crossing signs so that's quite useful indeed as well and then looking over at this house here very typical polish house bright red roof but what's more important is the dormer here inside the roof which is kind of like an extra room in like the attic or whatever you want to say um and so that is quite a common feature in polish architecture uh what else can we say here it's quite flat as well poland is a relatively flat country at least in the in this in the interior of it and uh yeah okay and these these trees also quite fairly northern feeling as well okay so i'm not exactly sure where i'm going to go here i probably just click in the center of the country for this for around like this so uh i think that's what i'll do maybe a little bit further south let's go let's go there okay and so we should be close here ends up being all the way down south near in near cadavitza and actually the mountains are not too far away from there so i i misjudged it a little bit but that's fine okay next one here well this one's interesting this one's interesting very red soil we have not had many soil dependent rounds just yet as we've been playing today but this one has very red soil uh and so countries where you can see red soil around the world brazil is the stereotypical red soil country and it's funny because the rest of the south american countries minus parts of uruguay and argentina in the panhandle here um do not really have too much red soil at all so brazil really confines it in its own borders obviously you can find some in kenya and uganda they're two countries that are quite known for having red soil as well australia cambodia thailand um they're all countries that have red soil as well maybe sometimes south africa has reddish soil kind of orangish soil um sometimes in the us where of as well like alabama mississippi area can have some red soil so that's where i'd say even even part of canada as well maybe um but yeah red soil like this i'm thinking of i'm thinking of uh brazil so other things that make me think of south america here are these kind of wooden fences with like a woodwood wood like that um fairly typical of brazil and obviously we are not using any script here so a lot of time people confuse cambodia for brazil but of course if you have any like latin script then uh brazil should be fairly safe to send as opposed to uh cambodia which normally uses the khmer script or whatever it's called okay so this one's a kind of a rolling landscape i've just been practicing my brazil recently but i'm still not entirely sure i kind of like talk on teens here but i could also see something like like in the really dry part of akra or rondonia maybe rondonio or mata grosso maybe so somewhere along this band here i kind of expect it to be um what i said to say dirt road coverage not too common in brazil but certainly seeable and um yeah yeah it's kind of like a brazil's kind of a country that has like hills all around the spot and then mountains along the coast so let's uh let's go for token teens here ends up being goyas so not the greatest guess ever but only one state over to be fair so 3 thousand there brazil stuff brazil stuff okay this is a fun one this is a fun one so where are you guys thinking here um this one i imagine many people will have gotten but at the same time it could trip you up if you're not used to seeing this country because it is relatively rare to see in geoguessa but okay so we appear to be driving left hand side of the road here you can particularly see that from this guy although um he is kind of driving more so in the center of the road so if you didn't pick that up i could certainly forgive you for that was i have a black and white curb here and for whatever reason i have no idea what the reason is but like black and white curbs painted like that seems to be much more common in second and third world countries um only first world countries i can think of where you could really see a black and white curb often would be like israel israel you see it quite a bit but yeah most most times when you see something like that you're going to be in a poorer country obviously you can see that from the uh from the kind of infrastructure here anyway but you know it's worth bearing in mind i think especially if you're playing an mpz or something like that okay so we have like a lot of pine trees here or something like that which is which is certainly interesting and the big one here is actually going to be the architecture so let's take a look at these houses we have like intricate patterns on this one it's very very cool looking house and then and these ones here i would say are the kind of typical ones very asian looking roofs here i think it's fair to say kind of flat and wide um and then you know you know and they they also have like kind of wooden panels and then also these white panels as well i think that's the that's the really uh that's really uh unique thing about this country's um houses and so i do believe we are going to be somewhere in bhutan here now i just don't think you can really see um any kind of houses that look like this outside of bhutan like it really is just the the bhutanese maybe maybe if you're in nepal or something but nepal has very limited trekker coverage whereas bhutan actually has some street view now if you see these then uh and these these types of houses lots of windows as well then it should be bhutan and obviously the landscape fits here as well now i'm not sure where this one's going to be the mountains are not the tallest so i was thinking of like some valley like that something like this it also feels a little dryer but i'm actually not too sure regardless left hand drive also uh british influence inside bhutan and uh yeah i feel i'm feeling pretty good here i'll send in this one will be correct it ends up being just near the capital city tempu or over here near the airport okay that makes sense with the with the fence so um well done if you got that because that was probably pretty gettable so we get 20 000 that time a 10 country streak which is pretty good um i say uh we'll probably end off the video there guys if you want to see more of these coaching videos then definitely hit this like button hit that like button rather and let me know in the comments because i'm always down to do more of these i like teaching so just let me know and uh yeah i hope this one was useful to you guys had a nice balance particularly asian focus this time um but i i hope that we uh we uh gave you uh i gave you some good hints on this one and yeah i'll see you guys in a video very soon

on guys it's zigzag here welcome back to another geography video today we are back on the teaching series where i go on diverse world and i break down my entire thought process for each round on no moving try and give you guys the best tips to improve your own games and hopefully make it quite enjoyable too what's more this is a play along so every time i go into a match i'm going to hit the challenge section and uh yeah we're gonna go no time limit on uh no moving just so i can explain everything and uh yeah i'm gonna uh post this uh link right here and it'll be at the top of the description for you guys to play so let's get straight into the first game here might play three or four today uh depending on time and yeah we're just gonna see um if we can get rather close here so this one is um almost well let's let's break things down slowly so we got um solid white lines on the outside here um so obviously it's filling fairly northern with these like pines uh so we can pretty much exclude um that it would be norway or sweden here um well you could be sweden but normally you'd have the short dashes on the outside of the road and a lot of the time in norway you'd have long dashes uh so yeah couldn't a hundred percent count out any of those ones but uh yeah definitely feeling more like finland i guess i've been kind of alluding to the fact that i do think this is finland also this snow pong wood that's orange the whole way and then has a tiny bit of wide at the top is quite a good clue for finland as well so it's a little hilly and as people tell me the uh the healier it is in finland the more likely it is to be north so definitely thinking of somewhere around there for this one um anything else that we can use here this looks like a finished sign you can't quite see it there but i assume it's probably going to be white on that side more snow poles so yeah just definitely feeling like northern finland here might even go uh more often than i had it so maybe over there let's see here and oh nice guess 64 kilometers that's a great way to start it off uh but yeah i guess the outside lines was the big clue there and right very close to sweden so a nice guest by me that i'm quite quite happy with that the border there gets a bit hilly so all off the bat here we've got an interesting clue here in the form of this stop um this stop marking on the ground you can see it's set up for left-hand drive so the car would pull up here and he'd stop like that and you can see he'll be on the left-hand side of this uh of this uh driveway here so this one definitely feels irish to me but let's take a look around for more clues the biggest clue for ireland or whales often often on along the coast here of the british isles and ireland um you have non-brick houses so you can see they might they're probably built out of brick speed they just have like a wash over the bricks painted over so you can't see that they're made of brick same with this one over here so definitely thinking ireland at this point um as for this one flanagan also i think might be an irish name not entirely sure about that though um but uh yeah yeah yeah i'm pretty sure o flanagan kind of a kind of an irish sounding name also it's generation four the newest type of like very saturated camera and uh that one that one is uh quite common in ireland as well as well as uh norway and stuff so that's pretty much all we got to work with here uh the left-hand drive is definitely gonna mean we're gonna be somewhere inside this area but yeah flanagan definitely makes me think uh of ireland and pretty much i'm sure most of you guys would know that as well but it's worth knowing where some of these english names come from so this one's pretty hilly not really sure where that's going to put us i would i would probably just put us yeah somewhere near dublin uh so let's go for that and uh yeah okay it's a little further south here uh but 90 kilometers away is a good result and uh we are on track for a decent school here that's for sure uh interesting we've got like very uh orange or yeah orangey brownie dirt here so immediately when you see that you can kind of isolate certain parts of the world uh you often see in thailand and cambodia you often see obviously in brazil it's quite known uh in brazil uh like ghana often has quite red dirt maybe sometimes even um nigeria and obviously kenya and uganda obviously obviously have some as well uh so let's take a look around here um we do have um some like concrete poles here an interesting mix of like whitish and orangish dirt definitely thinks makes me think of the amazon rainforest and obviously like a lot of rainforesty kind of trees as well almost looks like the northern end of australia that's another place where you get quite orange dirt so we don't we don't have any brazilian poles here which is a little bit concerning obviously the brazilian polls are the ones with like the sections in them they're kind of uh more flat these ones around uh but still definitely looks like brazil more than any other country just by virtue of the fact that the the the is very red and so yeah i'm thinking like northern amazon here not really sure whereabouts maybe maybe somewhere around here i would say oh there's this like fairly sparse coverage all through here nothing really out here it goes all the way up to here as well though so but yeah it's it's it's it's hilly but it's um it's it's also fairly flat so i think around where we have it here is good um could also be up near boa vista there um but yeah i think i'll just go where i have it here um also we have the stubby antenna uh which is you know possible to be found in brazil so uh let's see if i'm right and oh my goodness this one was actually in uh in cambodia definitely looked brazilian to me um so maybe the polls i'm not sure if they have those polls in brazil i think they do sometimes uh so yeah just a super tough round there and uh i guess a new number if you guys will have gotten that correct i didn't usually look at the sun so maybe the sun could have helped us there um but uh yeah a super tough round and not much more to say i guess sometimes you're just going to get those 50 50s wrong and i'm not really sure if there was anything that i could have uh used to get it right anyhow the next one we have a single yellow line in the center of the road and obviously that one is a clue that would make you lean much more canadian than american um obviously the uh surroundings pretty uh canadian looking as well let's look at here we we have a speed sign and uh i guess like in in um in the us it would say speed limit and then it would have the number but this one you can't make it out but it says maximum and that's what all canadian speed signs say so just the fact that it's one word will definitely help us out here also the fact that at 70 on a dirt road here you can kind of use some common sense it's like well it this road clearly would not be 70 miles per hour um which would be like well like a 130 or 125 or something i don't know exactly how it converts but you know it will be a very very fast speed limit for um a road like that so you can use some common sense and work out that okay it has to be in kilometers per hour which would mean it's canada um what's more we have a sign over here not really sure to be honest um it's fairly hilly so um i am kind of tossing up between both ends of the country here um the hilliness obviously could indicate that we're in bc but more mountains over there so i am thinking of maybe i don't know where it gets a bit hilly in like quebec or something like that but that would kind of be my my biggest thought at this point um so i might go there uh feels like it could be a fairly cold climate this could really be like anywhere in this area i think so all the way from newfee around to here so or even maybe a bit further south so let's find out um and 80 kilometers that's a really good result there so um i guess uh yeah quebec city yeah right in that area just one fail so far and everything else has been a nice guess uh okay so this one's interesting i don't want to look at the google card just yet we we have these uh square poles with the dots up them and uh to me that is looking most like a um a uh sri lanka round so far because oftentimes they will use a square pole that's made of concrete however this could still be thailand or cambodia or something like that or lao so we have no google car at all so this uh this leaves us with a bit of a predictive predicament obviously both countries drive left-hand side of the road um it's fairly flat which is interesting a lot of palms as well i'm not really sure what that means to be honest this one uh could be another fail i'm not really sure so sri lanka is pretty mountainous but you do get the flat areas as well so if we were up here that would make perfect sense uh say likewise down here it's just the middle of the country that gets quite mountainous however i think i might be leaning um more towards thailand here just looking at this pole the thing at the top is interesting for sure awesome just looking at the google car a lot of the time in thailand you won't have any but that's actually kind of the same for sri lanka's uh sometimes you'll see like the french flag kind of blur um but we don't see it either here so that that that is a consistent with both countries i would say so just kind of got to go with my gut here i think it does look more like sri lanka i think i will have to go for sri lanka here maybe all the way down south here is there anywhere flat enough yeah i'd say like somewhere over here would be flat enough so i think that's where i have to go here could easily uh be uh thailand but let's just rip it in and see if we're right or not and okay yeah walls just really far south thailand so about the right latitude uh but i'm full and and and in a uh flat area right next to mountains so a little unlucky i would consider myself there but yeah sixteen thousand uh so i'd be hoping to get more than twenty thousand on uh ones where i'm teaching you guys but uh at least we had three good guesses on the first one don't worry i'll come back now um so yeah those were type holes i guess uh sometimes you'll see similar ones in sri lanka but they might not have the dots up them like we had there uh so it seems like well doesn't matter because i didn't actually make this a challenge so it doesn't matter that that location was broken so let's add this one to the notepad and get straight into the second round here so hopefully this will be an easier one for me uh what's interesting here is that we have the yellow lines on the outside so that tends to indicate south africa or middle east they're the two uh regions that uh use the uh yellows on the outside we got white on the center so that's all consistent and what do you know we have flags here so um let's talk about what we could have uh used even if the flags were not here so obviously it's uh it's pretty flat here and pretty dry so obviously uh botswana would be dry but this is a bit more built up than botswana looks more middle eastern off the bat we're driving right hand side of the road so that would exclude south africa you can see this is set up to stop on the right hand side of the road also yellow plates um that is uh that is israel for the yellow plates and we have hebrew here and uh also we have the black car with a long antenna so plenty of stuff that could tell us that this one is israel beyond flags and uh yeah it's it's very dry here so i'm thinking maybe more to the south um but i'm not really sure yeah it with israel tends to be more green to the north more dry to the south uh so i'm just going to guess a bit south of tel aviv here let's go in ashdod here and see how close we're going to get and actually it is fairly far north so high foot you get pretty green this one's just on the beach and actually it didn't look very coastal didn't it um but uh yeah not not a fantastic school um should be getting closer in this rail ideally oh this one's cool because we've got a bollard so here we have a uh the alberta northwestern territories bollard which has the black white black and then wyatt and uh yeah yeah it's nice to see it because uh you pretty much know you're gonna get a decent score uh what's interesting is that we have like some significant hills to the north there uh and and and kind of rolling landscape to the south as well so i guess uh we could be somewhere around calgary here um the problem is that if we had mountains to the north um it would be easier if we had mountains to the south because then we could be looking at these but uh yeah i guess we're just gonna have to guess elsewhere here so is there a little bit of elevation here kind of yeah it looks like we have a bit of elevation over here so i don't mind guessing somewhere in the medicine hat here it felt a bit southern to me anyway and i didn't actually know about this elevation but uh it seems like it makes the most sense if i'm if i'm honest or maybe it's even too much to be honest um but yeah kind of willing to take that risk if we look back at it certainly uh certainly a significant hill but nothing nothing that big i think so hmm maybe i'm wrong uh the road we're on is going roughly directly north but not quite so it could be something like that um hard to say here but beyond that we have a fairly dry climate so that's why i want to guess southern here would probably look a little bit greener like this further north instead of all these dry fields but it could just be the winter anyway um i think we're just gonna have to go for this what about this yeah it does not seem to be healing enough so let's go for what we said and okay what's just all the way up here where i was just looking um so those hills are not showing up on the map those ones i could see to the south so i guess they were just kind of quite small uh 4.4k is fine though and it was southern alberta to be fair uh so this one's interesting um we have this like kind of black and white checkered bridge here definitely uh screaming post-soviet union countries to me over here we have a lot of uh bollards and um these ones are russian or ukrainian can't remember which actually this might be ukraine um a lot of times what you'll see in ukraine is extremely poor quality roads and actually i think these are ukrainian bubbles a lot of time they're pretty thick and just black and white the ukrainian ones are always black and white but sometimes you will have russian ones that are the same um but yeah the poor road quality is probably going to be the biggest hint here um in ukrainian you have the eye letter which is not present in russian so if we had if this was legible we could probably work out whether it was ukrainian or uh russian um i'm not entirely sure it's very green for ukraine um so my guess perhaps more to the north uh but yeah yeah not exactly not exactly obvious to me it's a little hilly but nothing nothing too extreme so i'm just thinking of guessing somewhere up here um and uh ripping in could easily be russia as well uh but these bollards and the poor road quality are the biggest clues for this one as well as the of course the white road lines and all that and okay this one's just a bit further south than ukraine but a decent school a decent school very green uh so here is an actual trail lincoln round you can see that the pole i was talking about before is actually quite similar and yes you do have these dots as well so it's very similar to the type hole very very angular and square looking down here we do have holes in the bottom of this sri lankan pole um so yeah that's worth keeping in mind here interesting just rock in the middle of the road lots of tuk-tuks in uh sri lanka also these are wavy like uh zigzag lines uh no pun intended um but these zigzag lines are quite common in sri lanka as well also they have these black and white poles so unfortunately that last tie round you can easily see how it looks quite similar to this round here um but uh yeah what can you do so here's that french flag that i was talking to you guys about on the google car and uh whereabouts will i go here obviously also we got the squiggly kind of writing very circular for sri lanka i would say um they too they speak two languages tamil and something else i i can't remember the difference between them properly oh it's fairly green so i might just guess near the south here similar area to where i would guess last time let's find out and the yeah 111 kilometers if i guessed where i went last time which i think i guessed around here would have had an insane score but you can just tell how similar it was to that last uh thailand round anyhow not to worry next one we also have concrete poles uh this one we have a cobblestone on the ground when you have a cobblestone road you you're generally thinking of uh europe with the possibility of south america but yeah generally europe when you have that uh we have a thin border on the uh giveaway sign here that's interesting um but yeah these are these uh concrete poles seem to be the biggest clue it's leading to me to believe that this might actually be ukraine again um but we don't have any antenna and a lot of time you will have the red car in ukraine or have a long antenna so i have to go back to the drawing board we do appear to have cyrillic here so my my thought now with the lack of antenna might be uh actually um somewhere in serbia we do have a hill in the background here the architecture there's a bit too many uh double story houses to me uh to feel very confident with serbia so i guess um i guess bulgaria is also possible but yeah i guess i might just guess in southern serbia here is that a bad guess hmm just trying to think these uh this sign on the house here kind of does feel a bit balkan to me it's just uh concerning how many double story houses there are uh but yeah this song could be serbian just trying to think this this does look like a hill in the background uh this like darkness over here so yeah i don't really know i think i will go for sober here but i guess we'll find out if i'm wrong right now lack of antenna as well okay this was this was ukraine a lot of time you will see uh the uh antenna in ukraine sir and also very hilly wow i didn't even realize the mountains passed through ukraine like that um and i don't have enough i've ever had or had around in this city before so there you go an interesting round um southern serbia obviously i guess there because it's a there's a bit more killer than the north the north is pretty flat uh but there you go these these mountains that wrap around through romania and all the way into slovakia and the alps that was uh the undoing of me this round and and uh i think most people will agree that was a tough ukraine round regardless we get 21.7 which is much better uh and most guesses were good there apart from the second ukraine uh but yeah let's let's head straight back in for a third one here hopefully uh this one will be an improvement on the last two because you know i i have it in me to play well and um well yeah hopefully you guys are learning a little bit anyway do smash like if you're enjoying please uh helps out the channel helps youtube know that it's a video that people like and here we are back with these polls again a fairly similar looking around to the last ones fortunately this one's uh a fair bit easier because i'm going to teach you guys something that you may not have known so this uh this light pole here with the extremely it's kind of like a saluting almost and it's got the extremely long light bulb here and this one is is only in thailand so if we zoom in here we should see some thai language definitely looks like it's a bit blurred but yeah we have another one of those light lamp posts over here um we got the standard tie poles this one's even got some sections in it which is kind of rare but this one's more than normal one i would say um yeah just the dots all the way up square um a little bit less square like i feel like these sri lankan ones are often like harsher edges whereas this one kind of has the edges sanded but yeah i don't know that that's just my conjecture also this house is on stilts so fairly fairly common to see in thailand as well so this one is green and fairly red dirt so i'm thinking somewhere near bangkok here maybe in this area of the country here could always be over here as well if it was a bit hillier i would definitely be tempted to go there but um as it stands i can't see any big hills in the background so yeah i guess i'll just go where i've said uh we have a phone number here unfortunately it doesn't really help me out um so yeah that's that's what we're gonna see again no google car here in thailand which is fairly common so a little bit further north than what i said here but still fine uh next one uh we have this one's certainly interesting so before i even oh wow so we are driving on the left-hand side of the road here and this one will actually be australia um but it's so green that off the bat i was actually gonna say this might be uh um this might be hawaii but now we have some aboriginal art over here australian aboriginal arts so if you're familiar with how that looks um then uh that would that would be a good clue um but yeah check it out this is really interesting so before i look at i'll make a guess before i look at these signs which probably tell us what city we're in um the fact that we've got these big mountains to the south is very interesting over to the north less so um so obviously we're kind of like thinking between darwin or the northern end of the northern territory when we're seeing around this green um i think um with these yellow dashes on the outside of the road that seems to be more of a thing that they do in um cairns or or in queensland rather but i do think this is going to be cairns also what's what i've noticed that there are big mountains here and the northern territory does not really get mountainous like that uh in a city this big so um well alice springs is but that is the house springs has big hills but they are much it's much more dry there kind of looks like a similar climate to adelaide but a little bit uh but even drier um so it kind of has a similar look over there whereas darwin is this green but no big mountains interesting red number plate here um but that doesn't really tell me anything uh so yeah yeah it says cans on the table tennis stadium there so if anyone's ever been to comment if you've ever been to cairns table tennis stadium but yeah we're gonna guess somewhere in cairns here obviously mountains to the south we're going to be fairly uh we're going to be fairly central here mandurah or or in the city center i would say the city center is probably probably about where we are um and we could 5k this but for the sake of time i'm just going to go there and yeah we were 300 meters away so very close indeed right near the central business district and 499 so good that i was able to get a good score in my own country okay so we are back in here and we have some number plates clues for this time so let's break it down slowly we have some old architecture we have double yellows in the center so we know this is going to be some old colonial part of the americas um because europe obviously no country is there apart from occasionally um finland will use the double yellow lines we've got yellow plates which is interesting so this is where a bit of a united states and canada um plate knowledge comes in handy uh the cut the the states that use yellow plates are new york i believe new jersey which has a lighter yellow than uh than what this one is and uh alaska the old place i'm pretty sure are yellow over there um so that's pretty much or maybe new mexico or arizona or something also has like a slightly yellow plate but yeah in this terms this dark yellow orange plate we we know we're going to be in new york state or or thereabouts um and uh yeah that's pretty much what we got a lot of brick buildings are over there in new york as well um and uh yes i'm also fairly elevated which is interesting but um yeah this is this is definitely going to be new york with these plates which is a very nice uh giveaway look at them all these yellow plates uh and uh yeah we're just gonna be somewhere that's fairly built up in a city is it gonna be new york city is another question i i'm not entirely sure but it could easily be like albany or um syracuse or something like that um maybe albany i don't mind albany here i'm not exactly sure if this would actually be in new york city so um it's also a little bit elevated around there which i like so i'm just gonna get albany today and oh five thousand points are you kidding me oh my goodness wow wow what a guess guys a hundred meters away a perfect guess literally a street down and uh you can't lie that was a bit of luck but we've basically gotten two 5ks in a row and that one's even more impressive because i had nothing really to tell me that that wasn't gonna be in new york city just didn't quite feel like the big apple to me and uh yeah there we go 5 000 points what a beautiful round there can we follow it up i think we're going to be beating people here i do think we're going to be beating some some of you guys who are playing along you gotta comment if you're able to get me but uh this one is uh quite nice we have we have a lack of trees here big mountains with a lack of trees and some snow um so yeah what does that tell you well a lot of times when you see a lack of trees it's gonna be something like iceland or northern norway or something like that maybe even northern canada as well however uh also in the caucasus and uh turkey you also have like quite a few trees for whatever reason especially in the rural parts uh as in the east of turkey oh so that's where i think we're going to be and we have some turkish language here we have the double dot over the o um not really sure if they call it an uml out there but similar to german um and we have we have town names here so if i really wanted to go for a good school here i could um so maybe we maybe we should search if or i don't know if i can be bothered but it's definitely going to be somewhere um out this direction of turkey um in in in some hills um i don't i don't see the town name or anything so i think i will just guess here but um if i was a bit more that's a very similar name there sankaya hey i i don't know i'm not gonna try and pronounce these properly but yeah this is similar name so i'm just going to guess out here um but regardless we got these also these these poles here um this is also helpful they use a lot of metal poles that are quite rusted and have lots of holes in the middle like this that's that's quite a turkish thing to do um what else dirt road also these chevrons with the red red white red and white other turkish colors and that's what they use for the chevrons as well so yeah a lot of good clues here and we should uh no no no antenna as well we should uh pull a nice gas here 122 kilometers so a nice guess once again this is looking more like it guys we are on track for 24k if we can nail this round here we have some uh russian uh but we have the latin transliteration as well so that might tell us um that uh that we are in like serbia or something like that so we have no uh antenna here and a lot of the time you will be lacking an antenna in serbia and north macedonia a lot of other european countries are the same uh but those two would definitely make sense and uh look we have the name of the capital city of north macedonia so uh that was not too hard we would have we wouldn't have needed any google car meter to get this here um so here's the serial link here's the english and uh it's saying that it's over to the south what was that that would be the south kind of yeah it's just directly south from us i guess so i guess we could be like somewhere over here uh do we see any mountains we should see mountains and we also have the name of this town here taban so do we see that we could still be over the border um in turkey uh in us in um serbia it's still possible but no i don't see it so yeah this is uh the other direction so i guess we should be between scorpio and there probably closer to here because it's a smaller town so um yeah what about like that we're honest we're in a roundabout right next to a highway here so could be that could it be no it's a proper roundabout so we need to prop around about here um it's got to be close to this place it's got to be close to this place i must say because otherwise they wouldn't include such a thing so i think we could be here um we're kind of on this side of it so let's let's hope we are it's no guarantee but it could be and uh yeah five minutes away so there you go i knew it fitted and uh what an insane see there 24 029 is a super good score uh so i've really really improved over the course of this one so let's check the game breakdown here just because i want to admire myself here so it started off with a decent guess in thailand if only i tried a bit harder there maybe could have gotten closer well around two was cairns that was simple enough we had the name of it round three an insane guess and round five as well around four was uh turkey and even that was a good guess so 24k you have to say guys um a really nice really nice seed and uh feeling a lot better now than i was at the start of this video but uh yeah let's uh let's head it that was a play along yeah yeah i made that a plan good okay and now let's do the final one for the video let's hope this is a good one as well 24k is hard to beat but uh yeah definitely pleased with that definitely pleased with that i told you guys i could improve and you gotta you gotta you gotta stick around to the end for for the magic to happen right so here we have a typical russian intersection guys you gotta know this when you have bollards on all sides like this this is russia for sure um and uh yeah double white lines in the center so as i said as i've told you guys russia often has the long antenna what's interesting here is this uh sign often you will have the uh yellow border on the russian crossing signs this one is strange for russia i will say okay that's what the normal ones look like so normally they have blue not red that's why it was throwing me off so these are the normal ones in the in the distance here this is a dry climate for russia so i guess we could be thinking somewhere around kazakhstan or further south here where it gets a bit deserty almost feels like an australian climate you'd have to say oh we've got a kilometer mark here so 28 kilometers till the next big town or something like that if we can see that sign we could probably get a good score here uh but we're kind of we're kind of relegated to just guessing based on the um road angle and whatnot so the roads kind of going up this direction here could even be could be this road here i mean we need an intersection so it could be something like that i don't see why not the road kind of goes both directions there so it's good to look on the map to see if you can find a a location that actually fits here but yeah it's gone fairly northern it could certainly be something like this um yeah i mean i i i like this road just because the angle is quite good um could also be down here uh we don't do we have a railway traveling along the using this uh gray dotted line can often be a good idea because uh if you can find that you do have a um a railway running alongside your road then you can just exclude all roads that don't have that um i'm i'm still in the mood for good schools i must say i'm still in the mood for good score so i'm looking for anything any road that fits a bit better here um but asset stands doesn't really seem like we're gonna find one so i'm just gonna go there and okay that was good uh 435 is is definitely decent for russia or a little bit further north here so uh kind of in line with poland there definitely felt dry to be that far north but uh yeah still fine and there's russian intersections with all the bollards that is what you take away from that one so here we have some snow coverage um very very snowy um we have like an avenue of trees along here it's fairly hilly um we have like some wagons here and some tractors so i don't know about you guys but that that often makes me think of eastern europe um we also have some brick houses which is interesting um kind of straight roofs but yeah um some poles as well okay this uh this sign is very washed out it's actually very difficult to read uh but we are we're clearly in europe this is a european style of you know when you're exiting a town to tell you that you're exiting it um but yeah the avenue of trees is interesting well what i want to saw notice at the start of the round is that we have this little an antenna with the flag on it this little black thing here and that is like in a bunch of countries such as bulgaria um it's also in slovakia and hungary i think um a lot of the countries with winter coverage tend to have it i think you can even find it in italy and czechia probably as well so romania as well so yeah it's a bunch of different countries but does help you narrow it narrow it down somewhat the road quality is poor here and also with the with the heavy winter coverage i am thinking of bulgaria that's my main port here these kind of like wagons as well i don't really know like these kind of trailers are very common in like i want to say uh bulgaria and romania they have a lot of those it's just like a kind of meme about them that they that you often have them but uh i i find that to be quite helpful and it does seem like it could be cyrillic here so that's why i like bulgaria the best also the uh the poles could be bulgarian so i think i'll just go here kind of central oh let's find out if we're close and 200 kilometers it is uh right near um romania like i alluded to those trailers being quite romanian as well uh but 4.4k is good uh next one uh speak of the country i think we might be in romania here well actually this language doesn't feel too romanian so maybe it is just poland it's going to be one of those two oh so these these polish uh houses here these are polish houses so i forget what it's called when you have this little outcrop with the windows but that's definitely polish architecture the holy poles as well also polish um and uh yeah we've got a blue strip on the plate here uh yeah so this one's fairly self-explanatory it's a bit hilly so maybe more to the south you often see a more hilly uh areas in the south of poland and this is polish language as well um i don't know if we have any uh l with the uh line through it but that's definitely a typical polish thing um i guess the only concern is that i could be misreading the language and it could be hungarian but hungary is quite a flat country and also i'd just say these are very typical very very typical uh polish um houses as well so yeah just somewhere in the south of the country here near krakow could be a good guess um yeah yeah i think i think that's what i'm gonna go for fairly hilly um small antenna as well that is that's pretty typical for poland and uh yeah yeah i think i'll just go for that let's uh let's see if i close here and the nice 150 kilometers i was right about the latitude a little bit further over towards uh ukraine slovakia that area there but uh still a good score so obviously this one is not going to be quite the same as the beautiful game last time but still good oh this one is kind of cool we do have like some big bear mountains here another place that does not have uh trees is where we are right now so we've got uh white road markings here we have a google car you might have noticed that it's kind of like a maroon brown color here we also have uh roof racks so where are we gonna be where are we gonna be here um we've got red houses white houses kind of a mix here we're traveling over a river and we have a ball out here a yellow and uh red bullet with a little white reflector there do we see any ones that are closer no these are the closest over here so what is that bollard guys it's a quite an obscure one but this one is actually the faraways bollard over here we're in the faroe islands we're gonna be somewhere crossing a river so surely that's pretty distinctive we could be like here uh the road doesn't quite line up we would have a uh we would have a roundabout so we have to be on some fairly sizable bridge between towns here um this one is not quite right either so not going to be there um this river this river is too long it could be something like this okay are we going east to west uh we we aren't really so yeah we're just gonna have to find the right one here i'm still in the mood for 5k things today i'm not always in that mood but today i really am so i'm just looking for anyone that fits nicely um kind of feels like it could be in one of these bigger towns here uh but yeah we're definitely crossing a sizable body of water so it can't be it can't be exactly there um starting to lose a bit of patience here not really sure um but yeah this this google car is only in the faroe islands you'll see similar ones elsewhere but with this color a car uh it's gonna be there so hmm can't find it i'm gonna give myself 10 more seconds here just to look uh it's not going to be that not going to be that one we already established that it's not there so i guess 10 9 8 seven six five four three two one okay we're just going to go over here not really sure could be close uh but uh yeah 18 kilometers away it was over here uh interesting so kind of the uh river it's it's actually showing us to be on land that was a very small part of the bridge there i guess uh but farrah island's so small that you're always going to get a good score and we have an interesting one to end off here this one with the landscape we've got big mountains double yellow lines in the center and kind of arid so this one is definitely a mexico united states toss-up just the way the dirt is as well quite very dry um and let's take a look around this way so uh we do have a just trying to think now could this also be this one could also be argentina i just thought this could also be argentina so we have to eat um sun actually to the north so yeah this will be argentina um when i saw the mountain because argentina is quite a flight country i i didn't consider it but now looking around a little further the the thing that alerted me here was that the uh the license plate has a little bit of black in the center um and that is because well that's just the way it gets blurred but uh argentinian plates are black with the white white writing on them so the double yellows in the center here that's also pretty self-explanatory uh can be all over the americas just thought it looked more like us or or mexico but then these uh double poles in the in the distance also feeling argentinian so yeah relatively confident that we are going to be in that part of the world now it's a nice road as well argentina being one of the one of the wealthiest south american countries and so we are looking for something with uh mountains on both sides but we're closer to the mountains on the east so [Music] um looking for something like that closer to the ones on the east yes we could be um that's a little bit too close i think when we could be that close hmm and then yeah we have mountains to the north as well they kind of end off and then yeah i like this actually the mountains over there are very distant indeed so we need a kind of uh we need we need a part where the road goes away uh this road is definitely just gotta kind of try and find the the road kind of angles a little bit the other direction so yeah we could be like over here um and now we just need to find a road going off to our east here which which doesn't appear to um that doesn't appear to be any that's kind of unfortunate um but yeah this is the wrong this is the wrong structure and i'm pretty sure the the road you can see it bends off that direction like that so obviously that that's not what this road does at all um i'm fortunate to be honest but we're going pretty north to south so this one's definitely gettable i'll just go over here somewhere um yeah it could be something like this let's go for that it's going to be somewhere in large though and uh oh we were pretty close so we were trying to go over here i had my had my marker there so we were just in the next little section over it makes more sense but this road was quite it wasn't as north-south as i thought the compass was a little dodgy there i feel like um regardless that was a pretty good round and we end up with the 22 280 so do comment how many how many times you guys beat me um and uh if anyone gets more than 24k on the one where i got 24k i'll be impressed with you oh but yeah certainly certainly not not the hardest seat ever and now yeah a nice round to end it off the first one was a bit rough so hopefully people don't click off the video because of that at the start but if you made it all the way to the end thanks very much for watching i'll see you

over here i like that near sendai let's go what is going on guys zigzag here welcome back to another jira guest video today we are back on the educational series where i'm going to be teaching you guys how to play geoguessa better and i'm going to be running through my entire thought process in each round as usual the links for the play along will be in the description so you can see how you guys stack up against me no doubt some of you will be able to beat me but hopefully i'll play pretty well nonetheless and here we are on the first round here we have a really washed out generation two camera so i'm immediately thinking of germany or perhaps luxembourg uh so let's see what this says here uh so this is in german so um i think this should be somewhere in germany pretty easy this is also germany german here as well and uh yeah not really sure so apparently i'm pretty sure maybe it's like dresden or leipzig where you get more rural coverage but obviously uh normally speaking germany has only coverage inside cities so this one is interesting yeah relatively sure that this is not going to be anywhere in austria so i think i'm going to go for leipzig but yeah it could be one of those two i think so this one was over here near essen so a decent 4000 score um obviously it's quite nice to hedge around here just because there are so many cities in this kind of uh area here um so yeah what can you do not the best school uh next one is looking fairly green also another thing to note about the last one was it was a little hilly so could have could have used that for sure okay so let's take a look at this one we appear to be probably driving on the right-hand side of the road here um taking a look at the architecture we got some brick here interesting like mix of houses kind of reminds me more of canada than the us so far and look at this we have a little mary here so perhaps that is catholic but the only real catholic part of canada or like north america to begin with is quebec but we have a front plate here so shouldn't be anywhere in quebec so i'm wondering i'm kind of feeling ontario perhaps here for that reason ontario uses front plates um so just taking a look here taking it all in i i do i do like canada better here i can't really explain too well why it's kind of like one of those very generic north american rounds although it definitely feels like a colder climate you could say that much uh so yeah i think i will go uh in ontario here maybe in ottawa maybe in ottawa that there might be some more um catholics around there toronto is also kind of tempting i actually think i like toronto better just because bigger population let's see okay it's actually over the border over here in new york so again not the best score um but it was kind of a generic ground and we didn't have any yellow license plates which you would normally have in new york okay so here's an interesting one uh we got well let's take a look it says kenya's number one soap bar here so that definitely helps but even without that taking a look around very green obviously going to be driving left-hand side of the road here given that we know it's kenya but you can kind of tell that uh by the way this car's turning into this lane definitely seems like a left-hand drive and also this guy's also driving left hand side of the road we've got a yellow rear plate here uh and then just quite uh quite tropical temperate kind of mix of temperate tropical climate here obviously we do have the uh snorkel as well on the silver car and so the silver car it's interesting um well the black car kind of drives north and south of nairobi and the silver car kind of drives well it drives in nairobi but all the way out here as well and with this soil color i would expect we're somewhere between el dorette and kisamu here kisumu um also both cars do go to um mombasa as well but yeah i kind of like around here do we see any hills because this area is a little more hilly uh we don't really it's a bit more flat so maybe let's go and elderette then i'll see okay we are 67 kilometers away um kimi lili community interesting place name but we we actually get our first good score of the game so that's nice um also the idea would i forgot to say this stuff but the idea would be that you guys played first and then come back and see and then and so i can explain if you did anything wrong or anything but no doubt many of you guys are ahead of me so far because i made the first two errors uh anyway this one is interesting uh we appear to be driving right hand side of the road we've got a concrete road here which is interesting always something to pay attention to when it's not bitumen but concrete um we have a japanese car here interesting kind of like these wooden fences quite common in central and south america i would say a hilly landscape and the big thing you can't really go past here is this silver google car with the roof racks and that one is found in among other countries guatemala but guatemala is the really the only one that fits with a landscape like this so yeah let's take a look around um if we're in mexico so excluding the guru kanye if we're in mexico i'd probably see this pole being octagonal although they have round ones too but octagonal poles are really quite common in mexico uh and um yeah it's quite this one's quite flat and quite green so i am thinking maybe south of the mountains here closer to the equator i'm not really sure this could easily be to the north of the mountains too uh and to be honest maybe i am preferring north of the mountains here i don't know it's only light mountains so we can't be on this central ridge that runs through we have to be somewhere south or north of there i actually kind of think well given the way east to west maybe something like this would work i'm not really sure but i do kind of like north actually better so let's see if i'm right about that ends up actually yes being north of the mountains on this lake so i wonder if i could have seen that i don't think i could regardless if i had to click guatemala i would have had a lower score so it's nice that i was able to you know click in rather the right area and uh well for a good school here especially if we nailed this one okay so immediately the thing that stands out to me on this one is that we've got double yellows on the edge and that is making me think of britain um and also this kind of dark red brick is also definitely consistent with britain i'm thinking more northern here but it is quite a hilly town so we'll have to see it could also be ireland as well uh so we've got dirt uk so that really helps out a lot and this one henry bres bessemer or something i don't really know how to pronounce that if it's uh uh from another language but anyway we have some yellow rear plates here so that would indicate that we're in the uk rather than in ireland um because ireland uses white back plates we've got an alzheimer's society here but no place name braniff i i i don't think that's what the place name either so that's pretty much what we've got to run with this round um the i would say the architecture is fairly like generic um if it was a little more hilly i would be thinking of bristol because it gets quite hilly around here and i still might go there anyway but it feels like quite a cold climate so i'm not really sure maybe i'm i'm kind of just tempted to guess in the middle maybe birmingham or something like that kind of go between um some of the bigger cities here i like that let's just see if we're right oh could even be scotland i suppose okay we're actually not quite in scotland here but right at the north of england in uh workington which is a funny funny place name but um yeah right as i clicked guess i did kind of notice that it might be more northern we end up with 21.6 so not a fantastic score but also not terrible so hopefully you guys beat me there but i'm i'm coming back watch this watch this so let's procure the second link here put it inside uh my folder here and get going okay so i really would like to get 23 000 if i'm spending this long long around i would like to get a 23 000 here this one's interesting when i was looking here with this kind of white dirt and the big mountains in the background i was immediately thinking of chile especially because they do like a lot of wooden buildings and wooden fences over here uh looking over here though we do have a a uh an asian car but that's not really what i don't know why i brought that up but anyway we have a long cut black car with a long antenna here and uh in chile you would have a white car with no antenna so that is going to be the big one deciding here now what i meant to mention was probably this architecture where it's brightly painted which they really like to do in russia and with mountains this big to our north you've got to be thinking that we are somewhere over here uh or over here so that's what i got to think about here which is more likely with the mountains to the north that's certainly an interesting proposition we also do have mountains to the south but not quite as big so let's think here um interesting all these houses are made of timber the the climate does not feel particularly warm a lot of the time around here the climate will feel quite warm i'm just trying to think if we were in a town like this i mean that would fit that would to be fair fit um but i i i'm kind of landing more over here so i just want to check out how how some of these villages would look with big mountains to the south so let's say we were in this town here we could see these massive mountains back here um yeah i don't know i'm actually kind of conflicted on which mountain range i like better here i think the architecture would lead and then the climate would lead me more to these ones but i guess when you're high altitude it's kind of hard to tell what the climate is actually like and that's my main concern here um i think also around here might have some autumn coverage or rain coverage or something i can't remember exactly what the rule is there but um regardless i think i will go up here let's see if i'm right and okay it was over here uh near lake baikal uh we only get 2000 points well i kind of thought we were a bit closer there but yeah there are actually big mountains over here and it's interesting the bigger ones appear to be to our south here because on the map it looks like the bigger ones are to the north so i suppose we were kind of looking at these over here it wasn't quite south or maybe i just didn't take a good enough look around or maybe these ones were just obscured by their houses or something i'm not really sure but yeah i don't know if i've ever had a round that far up in lake baikal but yeah certainly not the best score hopefully some of you guys at least got it um i've seen some of you would have uh this one is interesting we have a white car here uh yellow outside lines with white inside lines so oftentimes to new players i do suggest that looking at the um colors of the road lines is one of the best things you can do and that's this is certainly a circumstance with that being the case because this should be somewhere in south africa i'm thinking s martini or south africa here so let's take a look around we have a yurt here which is interesting often something that you'll see in lesotho um however this does not feel particularly like lesotho to me but yeah some of these houses almost look south american and it is the it is the yellow outside lands that are going to help us away from that the longer i look at these mountains the more i do consider that it could be lesotho and this year definitely making me reconsider my first decision here so let's take a closer look the thing is this long brass in the background definitely looks more esfatini so this is the first time i've actually had to think lesotho versus espartini in quite a while i think because normally they're they're a little easier for me um because normally i just guess lesotho would normally be a little bit greener than this that's my that's my main thought here so i think i will go with my initial instinct which was s martini but both both use the white color both have like a hilly landscape and are quite poor compared to south africa in many ways at least um but the yolk is certainly interesting i don't know if i if it was lusu i would expect it to be maybe somewhere up here hmm so if it was s martini maybe just you know maybe just somewhere over here or something like that so yeah by no means easy this one this flat mountain is definitely reminiscent of suture but i think i have to guess martini here let's see and okay it was s martini right at the south of the country so maybe somewhere i'm not that familiar with we managed to get the country um yeah plenty of mountains over here so that kind of makes sense and then yeah more mountains over here on the southern border this whole area of south africa and lesotho is quite hilly as well so 4.7 k it's not the best you're gonna do in s martini but still just fine uh okay here's the next one uh so i remember in my last country streak video i really had a struggle on a round that was like this but it ended up being somewhere in sweden but yeah when i see the generation 2 camera i'm i'm always quite tempted to go somewhere in finland this has like kind of a rolling landscape rather than being completely flat so i would be thinking somewhere a bit more northern with this one as well something like this um but yeah it's just the generation two the pines the birches uh also the fact that the tree cover is kind of a bit scattered here definitely feels more northern um also feels like quite a cold climate but i guess that that's just uh maybe that's a bit of confirmation bias or something i'm not really sure but yeah the generation two definitely points me towards finland possibly sweden here uh so let's go there oops didn't press space uh okay this one was sweden again in almost the exact same spot that that that wasn't the same round but uh wow uh super tough and really i was thinking north and there so that must be taken during the winter or like during the spring or autumn or something like that uh so yeah i don't really know if you guys know how i could differentiate that do do say uh but yeah for me that was that one was definitely a bit of a toss up and when it's generation two i'm normally erring on the side of finland there so yeah maybe maybe someone can tell us in the comments uh but what's interesting here is that we have a kazakh flag despite the fact that we have the google car that would tell us that we are in um in kyrgyzstan and i think what's definitely notable there is that uh there is no coverage inside of kazakhstan at all in terms of um official coverage on the road so that pretty much leaves us to kazakhstan kirsten here we've got a redstrip on the plate here so that is also definitely reminiscent or definitely would let you know that it's going to be kyrgyzstan only a few other countries would do that for example albania which i think uses i'm pretty sure the red strip might be on the other side of the plate no it's probably on that side but yeah it looks slightly different perhaps or just it's a lot rarer and the countries look quite different anyway and then i think also um bulgaria the old plates there might have had red strips as well regardless we should be somewhere here and so i guess we got to be thinking of places in kazakhstan that we could be near so we're in quite a mountain pass here so i don't think we're right on the border unless we can find a proper border crossing here that's inside the mountains ah so it could be something like over here or something like that although it feels like we're on a main road so this road kind of just ends which is interesting it's actually double lane this one is single lane and this one has a divider so yeah i'm not really sure i guess that is possible um are we right on the border here it certainly feels like we could be so i guess this one this one we're not close enough to the mountains if we look or i don't think so anyway it could be something like this actually okay here's something i'm kind of enjoying uh we we have the mountains very close on either side we're kind of crossing over a river as well so maybe something like this although the roads do not are not meeting each other or anything like that so seems like we're getting close to the border here this road just ends so i think this is what i like best and one thing i was watching a channel and if you can see the road here uh that means you're not in or uh jalal abbad that was uh that was on i think his name is jasper or something like that he was a i was watching his uh kazakhstan tutorial and he said that so if you can see the road here properly and and the angle that's like this then should be somewhere uh in the main part of the country rather than down here not really sure where this one's going to be but presumably somewhere along the north border uh looking at this one also doesn't quite feel right so yep uh oh almaty that there's probably a road running through here surely i might use a big city well i don't really see it so let's just go where we have it and okay what's over here so i wonder why they have the kazakh flag definitely not a land border but maybe just advertising tourism more i'm not really sure why that is but yeah 4.3 k is okay next one we got a generation two camera so thinking somewhere in western europe rather than easton um we have a kind of like uh black kind of slate roof here which often i would associate with luxembourg or somewhere in france near luxembourg or maybe in belgium near luxembourg um this kind of architecture also would fit we have shutters on the windows these shutters with the lines through them are definitely like french italian kind of vibe going on also this sign that's like attached to the ground with a border on i think would also fit for luxembourg so starting to like luxembourg the best here driving right hand side of the road we can see that here so we'd have to worry about it being ireland which it kind of looks like as well uh i would love to see the plates here because they use uh yellow plates in luxembourg but there are probably plenty of french travelers anyway so you can't trust it too much but yeah i think i think i do like luxembourg best here also generation two luxembourg is predominantly over in generation two so that would make sense as well feels pretty pretty decently flat here so i think uh i think a a guess around merch would be fine it could be northern but that gets more hilly around the north so let's see i will be close we will be close okay 4.5 kilometers away literally a village over um which is a really nice guess we were in unclesberg or something like that angelsberg can't really uh read it properly there but still a really nice guess went up with 18.6 so uh the rush i guess i'm not disappointed with at least we got in kind of the right region at least we got an asian russia the sweden guess i am disappointed with now i'm not really sure how i could have done it better i think i have some theories obviously it wasn't winter coverage so you know a lot of finnish coverage is winter so that's that's something we could think about there but you're not really pleased with how that when one went overall uh and then happy to get s14 that was definitely a tougher seed i know getting around that definitely going to be a tougher seat there um but uh yeah let's head into the third seed here and hopefully change our luck for the better hopefully get some more small countries or you know hopefully some places i know maybe we can get some australia that would be nice okay so we have like a medium length antenna here we have um foley poles definitely the first thing that uh drew my attention here holy poles in europe uh we're talking we're talking poland hungary romania am i forgetting one i think that's the main three that use them um you know some some similar ones over in france and spain as well we've got a blue strip on the plate so that would fit all three countries uh the landscape is decently flat also fits all three countries i would say um so now just to think about where makes the most sense i think there is a clue to do with the like length between the gaps or between the holes but i can't actually remember so we have to kind of go on architecture here this house would remind me more of poland so with this one i think this one in the distance would too one thing i've noticed about hungary is it has a whole lot of single-story buildings um i don't think this architecture reminds me very much of romania although i have been surprised by romania in the past so yeah pretty much feels like it's between hungary and poland also it's not winter coverage so that would also probably lean us towards poland because just hungary has a whole bunch of winter coverage in generation three so that's pretty much what we're looking at here we've got a tennis court definitely feels like a nice area i i i think somewhere in the south of poland or something like this would be fine and then you know if it ends up being hungry we still get decent points if we guess in the south but if i had to go as close as i could yeah probably somewhere southern i like this i think so let's see if we are close here yeah so as i said these uh holy poles can also very rarely be in france and unfortunately we didn't really have any other clues there so it ends up being france i thought the tennis court was interesting for eastern europe not too many houses over there have i observed having a tennis court and it turns out we're right near luxembourg to be honest guys such a bad start i want to restart i have to have to keep it a hundred we're gonna go we're gonna go for a better score than that so no more of the of that third link we're gonna play this one don't worry there was no mistake this is the reason okay let's go in again i don't like getting i don't like starting off with a bad score and then knowing i'm not going to get a good one after so this one is interesting plenty of clues here the big one that everyone will tell you is that the outside dashes are short here so that is something that would indicate sweden um for example norway also has outside dashes that are about double the length um so that's easy to distinguish you also sometimes get them in like estonia uh in in other countries around europe maybe like netherlands france sometimes do it i've seen it around the spot but yeah it's very common in sweden these uh speed signs are also filled in yellow which is something that a lot of um countries do around this area sweden finland poland greece sometimes north macedonia i think uh so there's some other countries that do it and obviously feeding sweden fits with our current like hypothesis this gun this car doesn't have a blue strip for and for some reason not really sure why that is uh and we also have a yellow yellow sun with a red border which is a swedish sign so we can we can be pretty sure about sweden from here also red painted houses also very swedish uh and blue signs up ahead as well which is also swedish so very sure about sweden at this point feels sovereign to me i kind of just like rolling landscape um quite quite pleasant like kind of looks like it at least gets decently warm uh rolling like rolling hills around i kind of like this kind of area here not too far south um but yeah decently far south these houses almost look a bit danish so i'm wondering if i should guess more towards denmark maybe i will do that let's see is it a good change no it wasn't really a good change we're up near stockholm so i guess this whole part like below and above stockholm here it kind of looks all pretty similar so 4.2 k yeah i'll take it this one is interesting we're driving left-hand side of the road and obviously it's kind of between australia and new zealand here just because we got all white road lines and all that and i actually think i do prefer new zealand here just because i'm not really sure where in australia i would put this so let's take a look around oh we have no car at all but the crucial detail here is that we have new zealand bollards so they're red like this sometimes they have these yellow bits and that's what they look like on the other side of the road with this gray strip between them or through them and yeah this is indeed going to be new zealand and i i have a heavy suspicion this is going to be north island and fairly far north too could be over this side could be over this side but these kind of rolling hills obviously i thought it could be australia at first so it it's quite a warm climate kind of reminds me of like wagga wagga or gundagai area so if i use the same like yeah if we were on the same latitude it would be somewhere around here so maybe that is where i should go uh yeah i kind of don't mind that to be honest otherwise just somewhere around hamilton or somewhere around here would make most sense if this was south island then i don't know the climate just does not quite fit for my books so i think i will go quite far north like here let's see and okay so it was around napier actually also 3.8 k by no means a great score but i feel like these rounds have been pretty tough so far not really feeling it too much today either this one's interesting no google car so we're gonna have to use uh the our surroundings more so here we've got sanskrit uh text which has a a line straight through the top so that is that's something we're definitely gonna be considering here we appear to be driving left-hand side of the road um but yeah everyone with sanskrit text i'm pretty sure it does drive left as well just because of the british influence back from the day um taking a look at here we we we definitely have like indian looking people around here but india has very limited official coverage so for that reason i think i think bangladesh is a pretty safe bet here despite the lack of a google car yeah so looking around further i'm not really sure a lot of the times in bangladesh you'll have a red google car with um bars on it and we don't have that this time which is interesting but yeah actually relatively common i don't see any town name anywhere um so i would just be probably willing to go dakar here just because it's an absolute massive city uh and uh this this place is pretty built up could be another city as well i'm pretty sure that there are some of this coverage out this direction here without the uh normal um bangladesh car maybe joshua or something there like that but yeah let's go dakar on this occasion and okay so whilst this one i said joshua ends up being a little bit further south so maybe that is a meta but i'm pretty sure that same car that we just had also covers dakar as well so it was always going to be a little bit of a toss up we get 4.5 k because obviously bangladesh is pretty forgiving so here's the next one yellow on the outside of the road but it's not yellow double so the question becomes is this actually going to be um britain or not this looks like they're flying a jamaican flag unless i'm mistaken and i know that london has a large a jamaican diaspora i might be reading into this too much but could we be around london here is the question so this car looks like it's kind of driving towards us or parked at least for left-hand drive um also the single yellow lines i don't think it rules out england i think it's just that often england does use the devils um so yeah isn't that jamaican flag is the question i have to i feel like i kind of have to guess london area or maybe somewhere around there maybe southampton or something like that or maybe birmingham or somewhere in this kind of area here because i feel like that's where a lot of the jamaican diaspora lies i could be wrong uh and i could be wrong about this flag as well does that actually make sense i think it does i think it actually does so maybe we'll have to check it out after this round ends but yeah i think i will go i don't know maybe somewhere on the outskirts of london would make sense here let's try that okay this was jersey so that's not the jersey flag so let's actually go check this out was it actually jamaican flag i hope that the wind picks up a little bit here as we go over so wasn't right yeah this was a jamaican flag even with the bob marley in the middle there so pretty epic and it even has like a pan-african flag in the middle and it says freedom so pretty cool uh and wow you can actually see like a little bit of a red on the jersey number plates here so that would have really thrown a spanner in the works but could this actually be a meta um this kind of single yellow line is it that in jersey they only use a single yellow line whereas elsewhere they use double that would be an interesting experiment uh but yeah i guess i guess i kind of got baited by the flag a little bit not as hard as i could have been now i guess in jamaica would have been truly bad but yeah we still we still pull a decent score guessing in london this one is interesting a red number plate would definitely scream brazil to me off the bat because uh in brazil somewhat like people were different definitely arguing about this in the comments section of my last brazil one but yeah i'm pretty sure people were saying that it's actually service vehicles uh also these are brazil poles with the sections in them section section section painted white at the bottom with dots at the top so yep definitely brazilian um taking a further look around we have a clear satellite dish also something that they like to do in brazil this one is fairly dry but we have a few palms in the background so i'm thinking more northern here uh paulo salto is interesting i'm not really sure if that's actually a city i'd i've never heard of it i don't think but i'm definitely thinking of somewhere around here off the bat yeah i don't see paolo or salto anywhere here um these red plates for some reason i always see them around sao paulo and rio de janeiro um but yeah i don't really feel like that feels like this area on this occasion we don't have any dirt a lot of the times the dirt is a good way to tell but unfortunately without any dirt i'm just gonna have to go on instinct here it's quite hilly so yeah maybe something like this would make sense somewhere inland a little over here uh how big is this town yeah this one is a decent sized town so i think i like that let's check it out if we are correct or if it is to be southern uh okay so it's a little bit further south not a bad guess near salvador here 3.2 k yeah not fantastic i mean if we went for a bit of a hedge it would have been better uh but uh yeah so we end up with 20 000 again not the best school but i'm still hungry for a better one and also because i don't think i've been playing that well today it's bound to happen sometimes hopefully you guys are beating me that would be really nice if you are especially maybe if you're less experienced because you know always nice to be someone who is better than you or maybe you're just better than me to begin with so here's the next one we got a bunch of white road lines we've got a bollard here which looks like the australian blood you can see the grey reflector and uh it's quite short compared to what you'd see in australia so this one is turkey that is the turkish bollard this particular sign here is also quite common in turkey with the kind of white v through the red and that that some they also love to use in the whole the south african um you know sub like sub-region or region um we have lots of like rolling brown hills here this almost reminds me of israel or something so i am kind of thinking of somewhere further south here where there are kind of rolling hills rather than big ones maybe something like this uh this could easily be north too i'm not really sure also this kind of like black and white road is also quite typical of turkey um not really a hit hint you'd want to rely on but something that you can keep in mind uh but yeah the bots are the main thing here for this one the white bollards look like australia but not quite also uh metal poles as well very turkish so let's see if we're right uh okay ends up being more uh central turkey being a very hilly nation even when it looks flat it's hilly uh but yeah six in a row now oh this one is interesting we've got some interesting like pavement here not really what you normally expect to see normally have an asphalt road um here's some people uh looks like we might be speaking a bit of french here definitely definitely feels like french so obviously france feeling most likely here this guy's shirt not really giving anything away okay let's look over here plus three two i'm not actually sure if plus three two is indeed the french uh area code or not i actually don't have not given the time to learn those and to be fair it's uh it's probably useful for europe and not not too much elsewhere uh looking at these guys not really sure a bunch of white people so would certainly fit for france um okay so let's take a look closer here it looks like it says fu but i'm not sure what what the deal is there that's interesting uh regardless short antenna yeah not really sure not really sure what this one but france would certainly make sense here so let's go and tour uh i don't really know where i'd put this this was in belgium okay so definitely a tough round architecture did not scream belgium to me but i guess the fact that it was like very packed in close together would like be more of a belgian thing i don't really know that that's definitely a tough round also speaking french like most most of um belgium speaks uh dutch significant french speaking population as well but yeah just rather unfortunate i guess now we have now we are in france because we've got a ladder pole here very typical france i'm looking around as well hold up hold up i changed my mind this scene right here really looked french looking at these ones these are the like hunting zone signs that you get in portugal and they kind of look like a like a like a miniature like they're either an on its side peru flag or like a squished together like latvia or austria and yeah this one definitely was reminding me more of france just because it's a bit flat but yeah i i guess this must actually just be somewhere in in portugal this architecture does not scream portugal to me i must say it looks more french there's also winter coverage also just quite flat this would be one of the flattest areas of portugal for sure so i think both countries do use these lighter poles this one looks more like a french one though so let's take a look in here winter coverage it just does not quite make a lot of sense for portugal for me this kind of like blackish roofs could this also be luxembourg is what i'm thinking because we have like this border on the side i feel like they might do that sometimes in luxembourg oh this one's definitely hard to get we've got some red roofs so but also some black roofs as well these black roofs over here were making me think of luxembourg so winter coverage huh i don't know how much winter coverage luxembourg cass i think i actually have to go france near luxembourg here or luxembourg near france here it's quite flat though so maybe we're just over the border in france here i don't really know but even though we have these hunting grounds things it just doesn't make sense doesn't make enough sense here for me are to go lock some uh to go portugal this church doesn't feel portuguese neither do these houses at all then we have to trust the architecture here so let's see if i'm right okay so we were right would have been better if we went in tour again oh where is that actually nearby anyway how can i not see that that's so strange oh here it is that because it was underneath the line but um yeah we were actually out here a bit of winter coverage definitely a french architecture so interesting guys from france have to tell me if that's also hunting little science there because there's those the ones you find in portugal so definitely curious that we saw some in france never seen that before uh but we managed to get away from bad gas uh here we have kind of a long lamp and a concrete pole he's driving on the right hand side of the road but i actually happen to think that's bait the um the ghoul car is completely obscured here which is interesting generally speaking completely obscured google car is not in too many countries although it's always possible in any given round you can kind of have places that normally have a car meter for example say you're in argentina where there's normally a car meta you could still possibly have the car obscured um but this one also looking at this text definitely screams um thailand could be confirmation bias but i'm pretty sure that is a tie flag there they're definitely patriotic so it would make sense uh but the big clue is this long lamp uh and in this concrete pole with the dots in it uh because these are thai clues so this this kind of concrete pole can be found around the spot with the dots in it but this this lamp post i'm pretty sure just thailand or maybe thailand and lao um it's fairly green here i think somewhere around bangkok would make most sense for me at least uh maybe it could be further south down here but we don't really see any big hills or anything so i think i like you know just somewhere around here best let's see if we're correct about that and something way far north so we were like in a valley here which it's a really cool shaped city but i just couldn't see any of these big mountains so not really sure what the story is there but um you're not fantastic guess this one we have the exact same long light so i guess we can just slam it in for um thailand this time we again have like some more red dirt so definitely feeling thai banana plants here southeast asia definitely a staple of southeast asia for sure and we even have a outline of thailand here so this one is certainly thailand this reddish dirt makes me more think of the cambodian border anyway anywhere up to the lower border so let's go there and okay we're fairly close actually ends up being closer to the mountains again so couldn't see them once again but went up with four thousand points and nineteen thousand so guys ah man if i swap these two guesses we would have had a nice seed there regardless i want to do one more maybe go a bit quicker this time let me see what the time is yeah i'll go a bit quicker um but uh yeah let's get straight into another one guys hope you guys are enjoying smash like and subscribe if you are and don't forget to leave a comment whatever you do feel like but let's head into the fifth seed here and hope that my luck is a little better huh okay this is russia this is russia this is russia uh poor road quality though could could lead us to guess um ukraine so let's take a look here it appears to be the black car with the uh long antenna so yeah definitely russia normally in ukraine you'd have a red car of some description all with or without an antenna so we have like some dirt roads here uh quality so this should be like snow affected to some extent so i just want to guess here and uh hope that we're kind of close let's kind of go up here i don't know okay this one was asian rush did cross my mind um but i just kind of wanted to go quickly so that we can make a new challenge i want a good score i part of my like part of the enjoyable part of geoguess for my monthly at least is you know getting that twenty three thousand twenty four thousand score which i have not been able to today uh here's an interesting one our generation two camera shutters on the windows so immediately thinking somewhere in italy or france because of these shutters uh over here we have plates that do have blue on both sides but i'm kind of less convinced that this is the italian blue and maybe then it's the french blue because both of the both countries do a similar thing so maybe french alps here um architecture could fit for either country for sure um but what i'd love if is if we could see a front plate but of course whenever you want to see a front plate you cannot um yeah but look at these wooden shutters these green ones can't exactly remember but looking at this language there um yeah this looks more french to me this whole word here i'm no expert in french or italian but generally speaking i can tell them apart and this looks more french so generation two somewhere out in the hills presumably i kind of like somewhere around here right on the italian border well that this is the only region that makes sense unless we were on in the pyrenees which to be fair my first thought was andorra so maybe this is pyrenees now i've gotta think for a second longer i bet they do have some generation two down here so yeah maybe i do prefer this i think i actually do regardless we're getting a decent score but i i mean i could be i could i could hedge in the middle and hope for the best but i i actually do that look in the background this kind of looks more alps so these houses here maybe this rock looks more pyrenees kind of just tossing up between them i'm going to go near andorra just because it was my first thought and this was italy so i misread the language you already know we're starting again we want a good score here so let's let's get that challenge link going come on we gotta get we gotta hit something here um replace that link again and get going okay guys first round is uh looking to be senegal before we look at the google car here so we're driving right hand side of the road as we can see from this uh car here we've got lots of african guys standing around so that would definitely make sense this is even a mosque so yeah senegal a a a predominantly muslim country uh and check it out we have the roof racks and rifts in the sky these rifts are pretty much if you're in africa and you have these rifts it's going to be senegal and these french style poles with the ladder on them as well obviously former colony of france definitely makes sense to have that this kind of attire as well where he's kind of like wearing like a dress definitely more reminiscent of the arabic world not really sure what the actual proper name for that is but yeah some kind of like long toga kind of not toga i don't know i don't know what the actual name for that is in the muslim world but something like that are interesting what's she doing she's definitely packed in there there's a lot of stuff in the back i think but nice nails she's she's on fleek you know um all right so yeah also some french as well so plenty of clues together this is center goal but you can see i'm kind of stalling because i'm not really sure where i'm going to guess here definitely reminds me more of the i've gone kind of north to south here it does remind me more of the sahara so i think i will guess somewhere around here but could easily be the other side of the country and it is so 4400 it's not bad it's not good i don't know i i tend to struggle with senegal this one is japanese we have japanese architecture wide blur with the low camera uh concrete pole and look at that we have some japanese as well um yeah and this is the standard japanese like uh kind of hazard um reflector on the poles with the uh straight lines that are black and yellow uh so yeah somewhere in japan uh it actually gets quite flat here to our east so that is interesting not really sure where i think about or what i'm thinking about because of that reason maybe somewhere over here i like that near sendai let's go okay first good guess in a while goodness me uh sendai so right near there uh okay we're just on the brink of fukushima there uh interesting i don't know if i've had around in fukushima in a long time oh but yeah turns out the the mountains were right close to us and then the reason it was so flat was because there was a whole city there um so a good start to this seed finally we managed to get a good score here we have the short dashes sweden and we even have a swedish kind of like um nordic style thin flag there easy easy easy decision um so lots of pines as well white gravel thinking very far south for this one definitely thinking quite far south it's it's summer coverage though and this this road does look a bit winter damaged i am very very much hoping this isn't all under islands but i'm pretty sure it's not i'm pretty sure just somewhere around here would make sense yeah i'm gonna go for that we're in like kind of the lake district you can see i could like over there i like this i like this i like this let's see okay ends up being further north again um yes sweden giving me some troubles today 4.3 000 is not terrible though next one looking at this poll immediately whenever you have a toss-up between england france ireland pays to look at the polls because if you can see a blue dot on the poll then you should be in france as for this one we're gonna have to use our you know thinking cap because this is not exactly easy a bunch of cows here this kind of grass looks like more cold climate to me we've got a big hill in the background so maybe even wales not really sure a lot of trees though hmm this house almost feels more i don't know it's too far away to tell could easily be um irish as well the fact that the fact that this hills is kind of confusing me i'm not really sure what i'm thinking here hedgerows as well always always classic for this part of the world yeah i don't know i think i'm just gonna have to go for england here despite the fact that i do think there's a good chance that it could be ireland i don't think france here i don't think france uh this kind of hedgerow these long dash is definitely typical for england and france by the way these this this is kind of the kind of length they use for the center dashes as opposed to shorter ah but let's go around bristol let's see about that okay this was northern ireland so correct country and that actually makes sense for how cold it looked uh but yeah not not a fantastic guess though here's the final one before we look around this looks like an american bollard where it's just like kind of a generic pole with like a little reflector on top uh yellow center lines no trees hilly yeah a blue reflector here which is interesting uh but yeah very hilly uh let's go for a good score here we've got a we've got a railway running to our north and we're kind of going east to west this reminds me of south dakota um or the dakotas come somewhere a bit more hilly in the dakotas so let's go around here oh do we have a railroad if we had one i'll just go for it but looks like we don't back to the drawing board no hills would be too big there how about over here i just want somewhere that at least could be the right road this one certainly can't be it oh what about over here no railroad again so starting to lose patience here this will be the end of the video but i want to go out on a bank you know the fact there's no trees i mean it could be like montana or yeah it could be a montana or wyoming i suppose but yeah i'm not really sure where i should go here south dakota wasn't really initially my first thought here by it by a mile so i think i will still go out just somewhere around here let's let's go for that so we were just over the border in nebraska i would count that as a good american guess those kind of like bare rolling hills were the big the big clue there as well as the american wallets of course uh on the canadian side you wouldn't really see like kind of those bear hills like that it gets pretty flat over here most of the planes is pretty flat but you have like a bit of the remnants of the rockies or something going on over there as you exit colorado so we end up with 22 000 i think that's probably the best for the video it is the best for the video shamefully um normally i'll be doing better than that but you know sometimes five seeds are just hard five scenes and and and and that's all you can do so we'll get a country streak of fire for the last one thanks very much for watching comment how you did comment you stacked up against me probably you beat me at least some of them i assume if you're a decent player you at least beat me in one or two or three or four or five uh but yeah guys thanks very much for watching the whole way and i'll see you guys in a video very soon till next time ", "images_path":

"transcript": "how's it going guys zigzag here welcome back to another geoguest video today it's some more expert geographic coaching i'm just going to be taking you through my whole thought process on each round and hopefully that helps you to improve by breaking down all the different things that go through my mind before i instantly send guesses on my other videos so this one's more for my less experienced members but even if you're an experienced player you will gain something and hopefully have fun playing on the play along as well so let's see what got in the first round here also i'll be playing no car so hopefully that also makes the guessing a little bit more difficult for me and makes me say well i'm thinking a little bit more clearly so first one here we do have a interesting round well first thing i love to do is always look at the color of the road lines we are using all white road lines here and so we can pretty much rule out the entire americas apart from chile and actually some other countries in south america do occasionally use whites as well and then we can actually uh say okay it's likely to be somewhere in oceania or europe or maybe some countries in asia like indonesia that occasionally use or whites or malaysia that use all whites um but as for this one we're looking at what appears to be a fairly cold climate we can see like very green grass here and so i would say that rules out a lot and it's not tropical at all as well i think i think like once you gain a little bit of experience you can definitely see we don't see any palm trees we don't see any banana plants sea pines that's for sure um and so yeah that's definitely that's definitely uh gonna influence our gas here okay so let's take a look at some more specifics here we have some bollards and they appear to have some yellow reflectors on them so not too many countries using yellow reflectors like this on plane bollards um you can see here's a better view maybe so there's no black section on these ones and so that's definitely a good tip and then also uh we're driving right hand side of the road so we can immediately get rid of ireland uh uk malta cyprus even though it's not in the game but those ones so i'm kind of leading you guys towards the fact that this will be somewhere in europe and also this uh red and white warning sign coming up would be yellow in australia or new zealand so there we go we've made sure it's europe now and now the question is where so as for landscape it's fairly rolling and agricultural quite a nice looking place um we are looking at some language here and we do see it seems to be some kind of a germanic language now if you didn't know uh this veg is specific to the country where we're in or at least very rare in other countries in fact i don't think i've ever seen it in another country so it's a it's a highly um it's a highly useful tip if you can remember the va the ej and then looking over here yeah fairly generic so so rolling landscape green nice looking high quality road and all that bit and the bars here are the other thing that seals it for me as well as the bay and they would both suggest denmark so this is this is danish language here uh blue street sounds very typical for denmark as well then we have a white number plate with these orange reflector bullets which are a bit thicker and sometimes they have this orange tab on them at the top and then also maybe a bit more of an advanced tint is that you often see this like very finely dashed outside line in denmark it's quite a dangerous thing to do i think you may see it in other countries but definitely most common in denmark i would say so i'm gonna say we are somewhere in the north here but yeah i'm not really sure um could be could be anywhere in the country for my money um but uh let's go there and ends up being yeah on the middle island here or actually on the on the eastern island near copenhagen so a good score to start off with no doubt many of you beat me there because um denmark is a relatively recognizable country but let's see what we got going on in the second round here this one has a bunch of country-specific clues right off the bat but let's run you through the round even if you didn't have those okay so we've got relatively short number plates here short white number plates as opposed to the long ones that you see in europe so but clearly we're not in europe anyway looking over this direction appears that because both of these cars are parked on the right hand side of the road we're probably driving right hand side of the road and so let's see where the sun is the sun is definitely more so to our north although on a round like this it doesn't appear to be too useful and that's because it's like nearly midday and so when it's nearly midday i wouldn't trust the sun too much here we have some script over here but as i said we'll kind of come to that later on um and so yeah definitely right hand drive double yellow lines there aren't too many countries in asia that use double yellow lines i'm just trying to think so so i think uh i think hong kong doesn't there might be they might be white w um doubles in hong kong um taiwan uses double yellow lands we are in taiwan right now i'm sure i think of any other countries in the whole of asia that use them i think occasionally you will see in in thailand and cambodia but yeah overall it's quite rare to see the double yellow lines you normally see single yellow lines in a country like uh like indonesia or cambodia or south korea for example and so these uh warning rails as you probably know if you've watched my channel much go all the way down to the ground they're painted yellow and black and these ones are the taiwanese ones you'll very occasionally see ones looking similar in south korea but yeah and so this one's very flat and so uh taiwan has like a flat section along the coast here this one gives me a bit of a southern vibe i feel like the south is a little poorer and this round although it doesn't it's not it's not very poor it just feels a little bit poorer than normal for taiwan i would say and so i'm thinking of going somewhere near tainan city where we have a lot of these like canal looking things around here um i wouldn't be surprised if it's a good guess um we could always use the angle of the road which is kind of east to west here so so maybe uh maybe this one here could could be possible but yeah not really banking on a 5000 point around here just just more so kind of getting the vibe of the round and yeah taiwan is easy to recognize because you almost always see these ones so let's guess it here ends up being a really nice guess 16 kilometers away so yeah this uh these kind of like water works uh are very common in this region of taiwan i would say so yeah good to know and uh that's one maybe one for the more advanced players in here okay so all white road lines again i mean what i say about the road lines very very uh very useful the first thing i normally check so we're driving right hand side of the road here we can see cars driving right hand here and yeah on the right hand here as well we have some language but we'll come back to that in a minute uh okay so um we actually have some french and mont blanc here so mont blanc if you have some geography knowledge it's something something that's on the uh border here right so mont blanc is between france and italy so maybe uh we are you know in this region here we can just put our marker there um as for the signs a lot of them are really big and have like a metal metallic outline and i feel like you do see that quite a lot in switzerland so switzerland is one of the things going through my mind at the moment and when you see such a a massive amount of mountains that are on all sides switzerland is obviously always a possibility now in switzerland you always have low camera and i think the camera is low here but i kind of cannot actually quite tell because of the no car so the script is doing its work so i'm actually not quite sure um but yeah with the with the uh french presumably we're in france or or switzerland here so now we can actually use a bit of 5k king abilities here so we look down and try and get the road angle so we're going more or less east to west here which is which is really interesting because this road goes north to south so we've got to find a section of it that kind of does go east to west maybe something like this would fit although we've got like kind of like a bend in the road like this um which um yeah it seems like we're more on like a freeway maybe something like this would fit more so um although even still i think we see all these side roads going off and i'm not really sure if this is really what we're after to be honest or that's a tunnel okay so it could fit it could fit um although i'm kind of not so optimistic about it to be honest but somewhere around here should fit and then we can also check the french side where we're not going east to west either so unless we're over here like kind of makes sense but i do think we are yeah maybe maybe this kind of region over here makes makes more sense if we're going east to west um so yeah that's about all i'd say about this one um these kind of bigger face signs i do think that is a good switzerland clue i'm pretty sure we are in switzerland here although the n205 i guess we can easily find that maybe the n24205 is actually french yeah it's actually french okay so so i feel like these still might be swiss signs you know i still think these might be swiss signs just in france um but yeah n205 presumably if we are right here then then some something around here would would definitely make sense uh maybe it is this bend here in fact i kind of like that not sure if that's actually a roundabout but uh the bend in the road kind of fits so let's go for that yeah now and 2.3 kilometers away it was actually this bend so kind of similar looking all things considered and uh hopefully you guys uh spotted the mont blanc but i have no doubt that you did and so the next one here okay nice little round here um all white road lines again so once again keep in mind what i said um chile europe australia and new zealand some parts of asia and africa uh but that's what we're working with right here and looking around we we have a bit of writing on the road which we which will be useful later on here we're using these yellow diamonds which i was telling you about you don't have in europe the the yellow diamonds would be replaced with um or with white and red triangles which have the warning signs in them we also have bullets here with a bit of red on them they're a little far away okay here's another one the red bull odds obviously bullards are just an instant win if you know them but if you don't know them i'll try and i'll try and um help you remember and so uh this one is either going to be australia or new zealand i don't know which country it is but i'm going to try and help you guys get it so obviously if you know your body's difference then you can use that but here we have a a signpost which is painted white and is thick and that one is is not going to be ever in australia or at least exceptionally rarely and and it's all over new zealand so we are going to be in new zealand this time even though the round you know plausibly could have been australian so here is a concrete pole that's kind of like hollow through the center of it and these kind of star ones you obviously see like similar ones in many countries such as brazil but this particular style seems to be common in chile and new zealand and these are two countries that can look quite similar in new zealand though you'll almost always have like a metal band around it and i'm pretty sure that's to prevent possums from running up but it's also to keep the wires in as well and i'm pretty sure that is most common on new zealand ones and uh concrete poles are more common on the north island where about 80 of the poles are concrete whereas on the south island is only about 20 i think so um yeah definitely feeling north island here it's very green uh and it's kind of rolling hill landscape so kind of feeling maybe this direction here or maybe just near the center of the island could certainly make sense i mean we even have the name here so um wimbledon is interesting i feel like i have heard of that i mean it's not wellington um i'm not really sure where wimbledon is but i'm sure within a little extra time we can find that regardless um this one is a pretty clear new zealand so the bollards in new zealand are interesting because they don't have just like plain red reflectors they have like a white reflector on a red band and we have red bands on all the on all the bollards here so that's about it to say here um yeah new zealand's pretty recognizable as soon as you know the bullards and the polls um but even still i think a lot of you guys with that much to your guests or experience could easily have gotten this one uh and so let's send it in and hope for the best here ends up being over here we're in herbertville interesting so wimbledon doesn't appear to have helped much but a good score so we're actually sitting on a rather nice one here on nineteen thousand so if we get a really nice score here we can still pull a 24 000 uh and so let's check it out so we have some autumn coverage here first thing to mention uh autumn coverage it's common in some countries very uncommon in others but you can kind of see like the orange leaves on the trees kind of deciduous trees so um yeah definitely definitely um going to be playing part of our decision making here so road lines once again we have a yellow center line here single and unbroken and we have white outer lines so that that definitely precludes certain countries and makes certain countries more likely like the ones i mentioned that have this before we also have this one which does not all go all the way to the ground which is similar to the taiwanese one but because it's not all the way to the ground we know it's not taiwan uh what else can we say here um we have a bollard here and this is just a metal wallad with a orange reflector and it'll be white on the other side here and those ones are very common in japan but also in south korea and maybe occasionally in taiwan as well okay so the asian style one and we have a lot of concrete um thin ish poles here um and some like very asian looking buildings here a lot of things painted blue which is very common in japan and korea as well um and um [Music] what else does that say here the the autumn coverage is what's going to make me lean massively towards korea here korea almost always uses the single yellow line as well and uh that is kind of more rare in japan although you do see it and also we're not in low camera uh the camera is definitely like a normal height here and so that would also uh help our decision making as well so korea is very hilly and that will also uh point us towards korea as well and then yeah what more is there to say i'm not sure where to go here i'm kind of just thinking like a northern hedge here to hope we can get that 24k um but uh yeah it's definitely just a normal looking korean round here kind of like these fields in between the mountains like like this field here is very typical as well and so uh i'm feeling pretty good about this one uh let's see if we're gonna get close here we end up pretty close just missing out on the 24 000 so 23 727 here is really really quite a nice uh score here and i say let us head into the second seed so hopefully do comment what you got here i think it was a very achievable seed in fact all five countries relatively simple especially when we had the french clue there so you guys got to let me know uh how you did and uh let's head into the second and final speed for today's video okay so the first round here we are using all white road lines again so remember that is a very important flute you must remember all white road lines it's the first thing you've got to look at if you're a new player next thing we have a green sign here and we are speaking a certain kind of language which is very recognizable but i'm going to assume that you don't know what it is okay so looking around here uh the roadblock is pretty good here uh it's definitely uh like these houses definitely give you kind of like an eastern european vibe i i think i think that's quite a reasonable thing to say here and so seeing a good road quality can help you somewhat decide between countries although of course it is a rather unreliable clue and we have a few a-frame polls here a-frame poles is when they just put two um together and they they supporting each other like that and uh those are certainly more common in some countries than others i would say like particularly when you see a lot of a-frames baltics poland um occasionally sometimes in the post-soviet countries such as russia and ukraine and all that you do see a-frames as well but yeah definitely uh definitely poland and the baltics are the main ones where you see a lot of the time you can see another one in the distance here and so we've got boards again these ones are kind of thick and they have red a red band all the way around so you can see that here and here and here and uh it's pretty hard to miss this one and sometimes then you have a white reflector on the red band on the left hand on the left hand side of the road i guess yeah and uh what was that to say here not too much the poles are made of wood often in this country you'll see uh concrete poles but only wooden poles on this case which is interesting okay so it's hilly as well that's the last thing i'll mention here and so this one is poland these are polish bollards and this is a typical polish town sign so town police town signs are green with white text and it's it's a particular font which hopefully if you pay attention to a few times you'll start to see there is a different font to other countries so um yeah feeling pretty good about that um good road quality is is pretty typical for poland it's one of the wealthier eastern european countries for sure and they just tend to have nicer roads than for example neighboring ukraine where the roads are often very shoddy um and yeah um what more is there to say they often have like double white lines in uh poland you can see that over there kind of in the distance but yeah the the dashes are also typical but if you see double white lions you may want to consider poland because it is quite um likely to be poland when you see that in europe okay so i'm thinking southern here because it's more hilly but you can get hills all over poland anyway so i'm gonna go there and ends up being 155 kilometers away right on the border with ukraine and so yeah i don't think you'd see such a good quality road in many parts of ukraine of course you can as i said not the most consistent clue but 4.6k there are certainly solid and hopefully some of you guys even found the towns which i couldn't be bothered going to look for anyway next round here we do have some bullards once again so it's really been bollard's o'clock here um uh know your bullets guys know your bullets it's it's very useful if you can pick them but also we have a bunch of eucalyptus trees everywhere here and of course this is very typical of one particular country i'll let you guys think about that for a second while i run through the rest of the round but very typical of one particular country okay so we have some uh white road lines in the center here single white unbroken with the white dashes and then it moves into what double whites which is also quite typical for this country um it is quite dry one must one must admit quite dry here and so the ballast have the grey reflector on one side of the road and the red one on the other um and uh yeah so we we're kind of using like um yeah i don't really know what else to say there's not too much to say here we're kind of missing any other context clues here we don't see any polls any signs we're just working on the bullets in the landscape here and i think most of you guys would be able to pick this is an australian round and uh yeah it is it is so many eucalyptus trees you will see often eucalyptus forests in other countries uh south american countries even sometimes in like portugal and spain but this one is just so many that you've got to think and they look like they've organically grown you've got to think that australia is easily most likely here and so i'm thinking maybe like sydney like outside of sydney inside the uh blue mountains kind of area uh but this one could be anywhere up to like brisbane area as well and i could even see it being you know around melbourne or adelaide as well all things are possible here i think i like best somewhere around the blue mountains because uh you do get quite like thick forests in that kind of area it also feels a little hilly but yeah i could also see easily around brisbane here as well in fact i may change my mind to go there hmm it does kind of remind me of both quite a lot so um yeah it's kind of hard to tell the difference between the forest when there really are so few other context clues but i'd say somewhere near brisbane or someone in sydney here ends up being right between really so we're near coffs harbour there uh and that was the guy fawkes river national park right near there so yeah 3.9 k is definitely solid for australia but to get the right to get the right state is what you really want there oh another interesting round here this one this one's a very interesting round okay okay okay okay so let's let's run through this one i think i can get a very good score here but i think some of you guys may have struggled with this one so let's check it out so we've got ocean over here interestingly to our east we've got a some blue text on the number plate here which is really interesting i've got we're in trekker because this street is probably too tight for a car well i know where we are so i'm pretty sure this would be tracker even though i can't see it um and we've got thin streets here we've got an ambulance which is interesting um so like a very white sandy soil and we've got we got a telstra uh phone box here this is this is an australian style of phone book so if you ever see this logo that's the australian the main telecommunications um provider in australia but uh looking around here we also see uh land to our east so where can we be so we've got land to our east we're either on a in a bay or on an island and i'll tell you guys this one is actually on rottnest island which is an island with a fascinating history in australia so there we go we are looking presumably over here over to our east we have like a small jetty here so i think we can use that to maybe 5k here um although okay here's the small jetty so i think we might be on like cusack street or something like that um do we yeah this would make sense this would make sense honestly um although maybe this one makes more sense looking at the right angles yeah i think we found the actual one here uh because that road kind of looks like it lines up and this one kind of makes the right little angle like that can you see this little this little acute angle here is kind of if there's kind of this kind of angle here that we see on the screen so yeah that is that is what the rottnest island coverage looks like you can often see on this island a lighthouse where is the lighthouse actually oh there's a big lighthouse up on a hill which i guess is this one here yeah so a lot of time you'll be like somewhere else on the island and you'll be able to see that one in the open fields but we're right in the middle of town here and uh what's crazy is that we've actually just found the location that easily so i think this is a really really cool little round and uh i don't blame you you couldn't work this out but oh yeah because there's not really any eucalyptus trees here either kind of just some like some pine needle kind of like a looking tree spindly trees but yeah an interesting round um and we're gonna get 5k here so there you go seven meters away hopefully some of you guys worked that out definitely a difficult round without moving if you don't know what that looks like but of course we could see perth in the background and it's only trekker on rottnest island and uh yeah not many cars either okay so next one uh and uh we are looking at some more white road lines again once again baby you already know we have not had many yellows so far just the korea so far actually uh we have these bullards with a black top on them uh we have some language over here which we'll uh which we'll come back to later we have hills big mountain big ones big ones and we have blue strips on the plate so thinking europe immediately when you see that and um we are looking at some of these european style warning signs as well okay so we have some like slavic looking language here which is interesting and if we turn back um this sign it's also kind of hard to tell it might be slavic as well i think i think it is and so this one is one of those classic toss-ups between slovenia and austria for me and they're both very hilly countries both use these similar bullards with the red reflectors and uh the black tops they also both grow a little corn we can see corn here corn very common i would say in romania serbia slovenia austria um well i said grow a lot of corn maybe maybe maybe sometimes in ukraine as well so i think those five countries italy and maybe sometimes france as well so they're the countries that mainly grow corn i would say and so uh definitely keep an eye out for that if you if you see corn in a round in europe likely to be one of those countries and hopefully you can use some other context clues to maybe pick one of them although of course it can be grown in any country naturally um all the time in uh in in austria on these black bloods you'd have a little like hat at the top or a little side piece but here we just have to play in black cats so that's more common in slovenia and i think the main thing that's mainly mainly making me think slovenia here is this ge suffix which i don't think you'd really see in much in german i mean actually i can think of words that you would see that in but you know it it run linger and this feels feels more eastern european more slavic and so uh that's about it it's just the reflectors and the language here for us um also on on austrian um numbers you can often see a bit of red peeking through uh which we don't see here but obviously these are kind of far away as well yeah i would not be surprised if we were kind of near the border here um so i'm going to go around maribor here which is you know fairly hilly and also probably more likely to grow some corn out this side of the country as well uh so let's see how correct i am 31 kilometers away yeah right on the border as i kind of suspected and uh yeah that's where you'll probably see more corn being grown and so 4.9 k is another nice result so we are once again on track for a high school here um unfortunately the australia around uh prevented us from having anything insane but uh you know still nice and so this one we have a black back of the sign here that's going to be the biggest clue we also see that these clips are kind of like all these are these side um you know escarpments or i don't know if that's the right one but um these red these red cliffs are kind of you know red so some iron in the soil or however that comes about um we also have like a curb on the side of this like rural road which is fairly typical of this country actually so kind of like a more meta or kind of like cheeky hint but quite often the case and so um we're also using the american style of warning science rather than the european style and we have double yellow lines always remember your landscapes double yellow lines okay so combining all these factors also so hilly quite nice hills um very green um with a bit of trees but not heavily forested this one is going to be brazil it's going to be southern as well i would say uh the hills the double yellow lines and particularly the black back of the sun the black back of the sign is a big one here brazilian black cracker science there's no other country in south america that does it quite as much argentina you will occasionally see i think maybe peru as well and and maybe some other countries um but brazil almost always does it and that's why it's known as the brazilian black back of the sign also red tiled roofs are quite common in brazil because of their portuguese heritage which is something you want to see in portugal as well and here's another example of that curb on the side of the road so high rainfall tall grass um we don't see any brazilian poles here which you'd normally see in brazil obviously but yeah we don't see any of those on this occasion but with these like grass covered rolling hills i would say somewhere around sao paulo is always a is always a safe shop because that's what you get a lot of between rio and porto alegre um and so that's what i'm gonna go for actually and so it ends up being yeah more so near below maybe if i thought about that a little longer could have got a better score there i think that was definitely an achievable one regardless we end up with 21 400 here which is a respectable score for the second seed i hope you guys really enjoyed this video thank you very much for sticking around all the way to the end and let me know if you want to see more of these these ones are always fun to film and i like the teaching element of it so yeah hopefully you guys did well in the seeds i think my effort was pretty decent here despite some hard rounds and yeah guys i'll see you guys in a video very soon um like and subscribe and until then goodbye you ", "image_not_available": [2], "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/fHm1jzq5mi5wxmOK", "data/images_zi8gzag/OzlVKGVJ687fh0To"],

that's sick that's sick so we are on the panhandle uh what is going on guys zigzag here and welcome back to another jira guest video welcome to the second episode of the teaching series um we had a good seri uh suggestion after the last one uh basically i've been trying to teach you guys by going in depth on some of these more difficult rounds on diver as well just trying to break down my entire thought process and alexi suggested that i actually do it uh with a play along and i'll put the play along links in the description so that you can play first and then watch my explanations and so hopefully if i'm a stronger player than you then i can help you uh to determine where you may have gone wrong and apart from that um i hope it's just a fun little way to play along as well anyone can play the challenge link so they're free to play in the description we're going to be playing no time limit with no moving the best way to play geoguess in my opinion i'm going to put this inside my uh untitled notepad here and i'll put that inside the description so without further ado let's head into the first link and play here so pause the video if you wish and come back once you've done the seed here we are in the first round here and we have a bit of language so we are in generation three car here we have a short antenna on the back we have a really thin um outside line on the giveaway sign here which is interesting let's have an interesting uh book on this u to be honest i'm actually not sure where that's going to put us in but i do have my theories about this round so far um so let's check it out yeah interesting language here an interesting architecture too i can't say this is a particularly easy round the way that this sign ends in a s um is definitely curious and we also have a hook over the zed here so i'm thinking that this one is probably going to be lithuania and the reason for that is that um inside latvia you have a bit of a thicker border on side on the um outside of the give way signs whereas it's a really thin border uh inside lithuania and estonia also the end of this word is a s which is something i do associate with um lithuania one thing you can do is just come in here and look for the hook on the bottom of a u so we're gonna look for a town with the u and just confirm that they actually do have that insight in lithuania i think i will go for lithuania even though we haven't found it and it kind of has capital city vibes so we'll go for vilnius here see if we're correct about that and actually that was in the other big uh city kaunas so not a bad guess 91 kilometers away that is going to be about as good as you want to get um in diverse world 4.8 k so moving on to the next one we have generation four camera and one thing we one great thing that you can do in geo gets is just look what side of the road people are driving and it appears that the way that this uh give way sign here is set up that we are driving left hand side of the road so that's going to be a massive clue obviously in terms of europe the only left-hand drive countries ireland the uk malta um wherever mortar is and uh cyprus i guess i think cyprus drives left as well but they don't have geo gases so that is a okay so let's check it out what i've got going on here we do have a yellow rear number plate so um you wouldn't see the yellow reenable plate very often uh in ireland they're meant to be um in the uk in the different countries of the uk um so that is a big glue as well and we can see actually a bunch of yellow rear plates here so feeling pretty confident now this language here to me at least um appears like it will be welsh i think that's going to be welsh rather than anything else and to be honest the hilly landscape would probably fit with that and the architecture too where instead of using exposed brick like red brick buildings we've kind of got like the white brick um could it be northern ireland um actually perhaps it is but this word particularly here these two words this kind of like odd um consonant clashes reminds me more of welsh um but i'm i'm certainly not an expert in in either so i think i'm just gonna have to go for it given that we have the uh yellow num number plates and everything i think that would make sense and uh we don't see the sea anywhere so let's just get guests somewhere um in inland let's go in this town here and whoa that was actually um scottish or so scots i guess that was actually scots so not a particularly good guess um but we got the right country i guess so but uh that was a tough one um actually in hindsight you can actually kind of tell that uh that was scottish but um yeah not not a fantastic guess and we'll have to we'll have to deal with it won't we so uh into the next round we appear to be somewhere on a kind of dirt road here we actually have some african-looking people but i'm not confident that this one is going to be in africa because we have a little bit of spanish over here so where then can we be um well we have painted front of the houses here so this is something you typically see in south america where on the side of the house there is no paint and just on the front they do the paint and it's also brightly colored as well um as for being on a dirt road i definitely think that makes you more likely to be in colombia and one thing i just spied as i said that was that the rear plate here um is actually uh yellow which means that um which means that columbia is much more likely because that's the only country in south america that uses predominantly yellow plates you sometimes get them in peru as well um but yeah this one definitely looks colombian to me it seems like it's in the jungle one thing i have heard is that the african diaspora in colombia is more likely to live near the coasts um rather than in the center so i'm thinking maybe somewhere around here is a decent shout um but we'll just find out let's see if this is a good guess and yeah it actually is close to the coast like i said so a good effort 4.5 k is pretty good and hopefully you can remember that one although of course when you do that kind of clue it's not always going to work out so this one is interesting we've got all white lines i i definitely recommend if you're a new player definitely focusing on those center lines on the road and being all white is a definite big clue over here we also have a sign over here kaya kilar which is interesting and uh we also have a unique bollard here as well so this sign over here when i was looking over this way i was kind of thinking definitely look a lot mediterranean i was thinking maybe spain or something like that i would actually looking over here with this bollard with the red reflector and the white reflector on the left hand side of the road uh and with this language over here we know we are in turkey so yeah the turkish bollards look very similar to the australian one except the red reflector is a bit shorter and the bollard itself is a bit shorter as well obviously the countries look very different and also we're driving right hand out of the road so we can discount australia immediately um but because it has such like a mediterranean dry vibe to it i'm thinking more southern i'm thinking kind of in the asia minor area near greece as well that's what i'm thinking at this point and that we could find this place but can't really be bothered so i think we'll just go for it here see if we're correct about that mediterranean vibe it certainly is on the mediterranean but a little bit further uh east there so kind of a okay guess only but um at least we got the right country and that's what it's really all about here okay so next one is going to be generation two we have this exposed brick that i was talking about which is common in britain but i don't think we're in britain here because we're lacking a yellow black back plate here actually you can see it has a tinge of red so that is definitely leading me to believe that this one is going to be belgium because belgian plates often do have a bit of red uh text on them and that is kind of more or less unique to belgium inside europe at least so in terms of these exposed brick houses you're going to see them on the border with belgium in france in belgium in the netherlands in england and in denmark that's the that's the most of the countries where you'll actually see exposed like plain brick like this which is like the kind of brick that you would see um like in i don't know you also see them like quite a bit in the us quite a bit in australia and new zealand as well so that's basically what i could say about that also we are generation two here as well so remember that means uh more likely to be in developed countries that got google coverage first because it's older and so i think we can pretty much guess here it's quite flat um it definitely reminds me of belgium so i'm just going to go somewhere near france over here and how close will we be not bad other side of brussels 91 kilometers obviously belgium a small country so not the fan not not the most fantastic guess we end up with 21 600 uh the only fail here was in uh scotland i somehow mistook welsh for scottish at least i didn't get an island i guess but uh yeah we end up with 21 000 for the first game so let's go play again and uh get our second challenge link here so yeah go ahead and play this one if you are still playing along otherwise just uh join in for the ride that's fine as well and uh yeah let's get straight into it here so here we go on the first round here we immediately have faded yellow double lines in the center we also have these yellow and black turning arrows the yellow and black turning arrows would be indicative of being in the types of countries that use yellow warning signs as opposed to white ones so that would be the americas and that would be yeah both north and south america that would be some places in australia new zealand and asia and uh yeah that would be quite rare to see in europe normally europe has their own colour schemes for the turning chevron arrows uh additionally we have a sign over here with a cross on the back and uh perhaps if you've been playing geoguessa a while now you've heard of the colombian cross which is just um terminology for the fact that in columbia they often have a cross on the back of their signs so yeah this should be in columbia obviously the yellow uh center lines fit that and also we have a black car with an antenna which is a car that you can get in colombia so it's all making sense we're going over a river here it feels very green very like almost amazonian but you know definitely somewhere inside the jungle here and i'm thinking just somewhere in the heart of the mountains here would make sense for colombia so let's just go there and uh yeah this was actually right out in a similar place to the last one i didn't think it had a similar vibe to the last one uh the last one was somewhere over here this one is over here so not a bad score not a great one either but you know it's columbia it's actually a big country uh to see deceptively big on the equator there with the certain projection that the google maps use so this one is good we're actually going to be able to figure this one out based on architecture i think so let's run through the different clues here we have a lot of stilts houses that's why i said architecture because stilts houses are particularly common um in southeast asia all these different countries used a lot of stills houses are particularly associated with cambodia and thailand and actually uh just as on another side if you see stiltz houses in australia you're likely to be in in the nt or queensland that's where they use most of them in australia but uh yeah i am thinking of thailand and cambodia here especially uh because of these stilts houses like this one this one and this one also we have red soil so the red soil is going to be a big clue as well you definitely have a lot of red soil in thailand out in this kind of region crossing over into cambodia as well so that is going to be part of our consideration furthermore in terms of in terms of southeast asia we got motorbike motorbike motorbike um so definitely thinking that southeast asia makes sense here as well on account of that another motor back here they love them in southeast asia so yeah feeling confident about that we also have no google car but this is generation three coverage and let's take a look at this motorbike driver over here she's actually driving or he is actually driving on well actually i think it's a bit too far away it's actually more in the center of the road so we can't really make that out just yet we have a concrete pole here and a concrete pole here so in terms of this concrete pole we can see if we make it out that we've got dot dot dot it's kind of got dots going all the way up and it's a square pole so i think that is definitely more typical of thailand than cambodia so i am thinking that thailand is going to be a good shot here it's fairly green so maybe a bit further well south it gets a bit dry over here so maybe a bit further south here could also be on this side over here as well i i do consider um we can't see any mountains although that kind of looks like a mountain in the background so uh maybe this still makes sense because there are a few mountains over this side could be over here as well um but i think i'm pretty confident here the red soil the stilts houses are going to be the big clues here let's see if we're correct and this is actually all the way up near lao actually gets a little bit hilly over here as well apparently um so not fantastic guests but still the right country and we're going well we're actually on a six country streak here for some reason it's not counting uh but um i'll not fix that after the seed uh we are on generation two here this is this is an interesting round actually so not entirely obvious to me where we're going to be off the bat but generation two so the sun is to the south here so we should be in the northern hemisphere so we can dispel any uh notion that we could be in like south africa here or something like that always has a bit of a south african move to it but nowhere not there also as i was talking about in the previous round we do have a white warning sign as opposed to a yellow one as i said like the americas normally using yellow ones so we're not going to be in the americas here that's also a big clue let's check it out we have a black and white turning arrow as i saying yeah the turning arrows they're going to be different in different countries this is a black and white one um and so you have to kind of memorize all the different ones of europe there are plenty of different combinations um i will say though that i think that this one is feeling like spain because this black and white one you can also get them in italy as well in and plenty of other countries too but spain feeling kind of likely here because it's so dry um obviously you can see like this is not even grass at all it's just kind of well it looks almost like australia or south africa in the fact that it's so dry so i am thinking spain is probably our best shot here another thing to mention is that this sun on the red border has no white border outside the red border and that's also quite common in spain you can also see it in like belgium and netherlands i think it really depends on the sign but uh i think that probably does mean we're going to be in spain here we've got some mountains to the south um so we're going to guess somewhere in the south here i think uh maybe somewhere a bit south south of madrid i think that's going to be a good guess so let's see here and actually this was in the desert in spain if you zoom out you can actually see that we are yeah we're right on the edge of the desert there other side of madrid but uh a decent score and we got the right country so going pretty well here we've actually got them all correct so far as far as i can remember and uh here we are in one of our first tough ones but this one's certainly gettable uh so we do have some white center lines here so that would i mean they're kind of a bit sketchy but that would probably suggest that we're not in north america so that's good uh and now if we turn our attention here we've got a ladder pole and these ladder poles as we said in the last episode i think they're going to be found in france they're the kind of ones that you can climb up and um you can also find them sometimes i think in spain and maybe in belgium as well but the real nail on the coffin here is that this uh wooden pole here has a blue reflector on it and those blue reflectors are found in france and basically france only in terms of europe you can actually find a couple of states in australia that use them as well um but actually we've got a bit of french here as well and uh yeah this one's interesting not exactly sure where i'm gonna put it i'm thinking maybe a little bit south west of paris but um not entirely sure not not gonna be super confident with this guess but we'll see i hope i caught us and it is southwest of paris just a lot more south and a little bit less west um but uh not a bad guess not a bad guess so next one is going to be generation 4. um let us run through what's going on here so we have in the background big mountains of course don't underestimate mountains mountains are going to be a big part of where you decide to guess and what you don't they're very flat especially in europe they're very flat countries like finland estonia latvia lithuania where you don't wait when you see a mountain you know you're not going to be there because they just don't have big mountains like that this big mountain in the background however is not so useful because we're in asia where we have south korea japan taiwan philippines is the big options here and uh obviously they all have mountains those countries interestingly we have kind of a bigger number plate here um we have very tropical uh looking plants here and i would suggest that looks like a bit of chinese although perhaps i'm only suggesting that because this uh this hazard thing that on the pole that goes all the way down to the ground is only found in taiwan now you would find a similar one in south korea but it doesn't go all the way to the ground and the yellow is a lot less orange this is kind of an orangey yellow also we have generation four here so that is something you do find in taiwan so it's all starting to make sense here this one is also looking like chinese to me so yes i i do think that we are going to be somewhere in taiwan here maybe thinking a little bit further south although i do but you often have generation 4 to the north so i might actually just go halfway up here and let's find out and yeah this one one was actually south and perhaps we could have used the fact that there were no mountains over um to the uh would you say over to the east there to work this out because yeah most people live where there are mountains to the west um in taiwan there's just a little bit of population on the other side of the island here anyhow not a fantastic guess but we still get a lot of points because taiwan is so small and that's the second one we get 21 000 again congratulations if you beat me um but if you beat me maybe you don't need these videos so much anyhow that was um that was very good and i think we'll just move straight on to the next one we're just going to keep on going keep on chilling i can record for quite a bit longer so we may as well uh here is the third challenge link uh so i'm gonna post that inside the description so go ahead and hit it up right now and let's head into here and see how we go alright so here we are in the first round of the third seed we do have white road lines here white white white so that is going to be a big clue of course we have a board here which is either missing its reflector or it has no reflector so that is interesting we're going to turn around here and take a look so the google car is obscured here we have a green road sign that is interesting we have these bollards where they're missing the reflectors or i'm not exactly sure what the deal is here but that is very interesting so we have some mountains here that is also good to know it says polaris interesting and look at this this uh the inside of this sign is built in yellow so i'm starting to think about which country it is here my initial uh thought is north macedonia and the reason for that is one these bollards i'm not so familiar with like i always struggle with north macedonia but i feel like they kind of use these standard european ones and two let me actually take a bit of a better look around here before i make a fool of myself the second reason i was thinking of it was that we have the yellow field in on the kind of giveaway sign here and you find that a bit in north macedonia in greece in poland so i think poland's probably the only other option here these are not polish bollards though so that is interesting this architecture not sure what i think to be honest do we have any rifts in the sky we don't have any rifts in the sky you would see rifts in albania and montenegro but again the bullards don't fit so i think we are going to be in north macedonia here i'm not terribly confident when it comes to north macedonian architecture to be honest and you can find quite a bit of cyrillic there as well um and i don't see any here that is my other concern so could it be hungry i think the mountains are too big for hungry um so i do think we're right here i just want to find some cyrillic or something like that okay there's some i think i'm pretty sure that is cyrillic unless it's just wishful thinking but i think i'm right uh in which case i think i will go for north macedonia here let's see if i correct and it was that is a really good guess um and i hope you guys learned a little bit there even though i wasn't so confident on it you kind of use your um kind of use your bellard's knowledge and kind of a process of elimination to get it there and actually yeah there were big mountains over there uh near the capital city so uh this is going well 4800 a good start to the seed so here we are and uh right off the bat we can get the country or the region very nicely just by the royal lands as i say guys always check out the road lines so here we have white center lines with yellow outside lines that is going to be a massive clue because the only countries that use that are the middle eastern ones and the south african ones or at least the ones in geogasa we have a white car so that is going to be consistent with all the south african nations and we can zoom in here and actually see that we have uh town names as well so kane i'm not actually sure if i've heard of it i'm definitely thinking if we are in south africa we're going to be somewhere up here um just thinking is what is martini here also possible i think it's going to be a bit too flat for s martini generally speaking if we were in s14 we'd be able to see the backdrop of these mountains here or these mountains here so unless we were literally in the flattest part of the country i think we would be able to see that um so yeah feeling fairly confident that we are going to be actually in south africa here or botswana so as we move over here we can actually see kane so that's actually going to be a big help here because i was actually kind of thinking of south africa over botswana but sometimes you need a bit of luck and sure enough we definitely have it here um yeah so in botswana you only ever find the white car in south africa you will find the white car and the generation 2 camera as well so as for the rest of the round it's definitely quite desolate so that would make sense and we can probably get a good score here here if we go between kang and what was the other place then the other place was i'm just looking for it i don't want to try pronounce it so i'm just trying to look for it on the map instead uh i'm assuming that it's gonna probably be down this way um but yeah i actually can't find it so hopefully this is not a double up hopefully this is not in um south africa but yeah i'm just going to guess on kang and if it's not it's not let's see where we are and yeah we were oh there it is so yeah we're actually really close to this town and we don't actually get the best score you would have actually gotten a better one if i just went on gabarone no problem though a decent score okay so moving on to the next round here let's check out what we've got going on we've got some bollards here these bollards are typical of thailand and um indonesia so we're going to keep that in mind maybe to be driving well let's check it out we are actually driving on the left-hand side of the road these guys are just overtaking the google car so be careful not to get tricked because often times there's funny business happening around the google car on account of it taking up too much room on the road or whatever we have a white car here we have a red flag flying which is interesting but you can see we are definitely driving on the left hand side of the road here we have a black number plate with three sections of text so it's going to be like numbers let us numbers or something like that and that is typical of indonesia rather than malaysia malaysia would have two sets uh and then we have a yellow number plate over here which is something you'll often see on bigger vehicles in indonesia you can also find red number plates the same in indonesia um they're quite rare but you can see them every now and again these black and white curbs that would also be i'm consistent and perhaps the biggest no it's just the language here because we know we're not speaking entire there's no thai script and so with these bars we can feel fairly confident about um about indonesia here now actually remember the indonesia phone codes this one's o7 so i'm pretty sure 07 puts us on i think it puts us on southern sumatra unless my memory serves me incorrectly i think it's 08 no wait let me think now i think it's i think oh wait it's out here i think it's 07.0203.0405.08 so i think we are going to be somewhere on sumatra here if my memory just serves me correctly but i can't find the name of any town um so i'm just going to go here let's see if we're correct and yeah it actually was a really good guess this is really good for indonesia i haven't memorized the codes for many countries but if you can that 07 at the start of the phone number really helped us out there and yeah we were over on this island in a town called mentok so actually quite a nice and interesting looking place there pretty cool indonesia is a fascinating place next round we have a yellow rear plate here interestingly though we have white white and white over here um it appears that we also have a bit of blue on the other side of the plate here and now you may have heard that italy um will often have blue on both sides of the plate like this however the italian ones are short plates so i think that's actually going to be a really good clue for us here so let's continue to think about it a bit longer so we have a generation four camera here you can see it's like the colors really pop it's really like modern looking coverage we also have brick as well which we've been talking about earlier in the video um but this yellow number plate is very interesting i think it's going to put us in france and the reason for that is the old plates in france were yellow and also you can also find these yellow these blue like a slight blue patch on the other side of plates um inside of france's where you can see it better on this number plate here where it's got like a little region code on it um so i do think france is most likely here and the great thing about france is they produce a lot of their own cars so often you can find french cars when you have french round and actually i think this is a terrible example because we have italian cars we have spanish cars we actually have only have like one two three french cars and the whole i think it's something we've got only two french cars in the whole scene but crucially we have some ladder poles here so that is going to be pretty much put us in france fortunately there they are there to confirm my suspicions so so so given that we have this exposed brick over here that i was talking about in this kind of like red brick um i would say that we might be somewhere north of paris here um i think we're going to be north of paris but we could be all the way from brest over to strasbourg here i'm not really sure whereabouts is going to be um but it could even be in paris to be on the summit just go in paris here orleans um i might go there actually let's see and actually yeah this was way up in um the post near calais so kind of a tough round there um definitely kind of looked a bit more belgium in terms of the architecture but also kind of had like a british look to it off the bat that's what i thought at least um so maybe i should have taken that into consideration it's not something i said but i did think um okay so next round we've got rumble strips on the outside of the road and we have these double yellow lines so i'm thinking usa for that reason and we're on the u.s 287 so that definitely helps also another thing to differentiate the us and canada are these teeth all along the pole that is quite a american thing to do although you can find them in canada as well checking out we've got these black and uh yellow uh turning arrows which i was talking about for the americas definitely a good clue okay so we're very flat or at least relatively flat it's quite wintry it's quite desolate we've got these rumble strips i'm thinking maybe somewhere in oklahoma or northern texas for that reason could be all the way up to the dakotas though kind of has a great plains feel to it about it it's the only thing on the pole not really sure about that to be honest um but yeah it also seems to be winter coverage like the trees don't have any leaves on them i've heard that you often get some winter coverage up here um but what's the name of the highway again so we can see some numbers here from the 287 do we see any 287 in the panhandle there's a 283 so maybe we're out maybe we are close there's a 287 here oh okay so let's take a look for the other side the other side is the east to west 19 so the 287 kind of runs up like this and okay so i don't know if we're actually on the right one here i'm pretty sure this is like a state shield um so we we could certainly um yeah it could certainly be on a different 287 or something like that east west 19 arthur can we see that i'm actually not sure so the 27 does seem to run up like this so i kind of think we are on the right on the right track here but given that it's very flat seems more likely to be in in this region of the country so let's see kind of took a bit too long here anyway and oh what a gas that's sick that's sick so we are on the panhandle i haven't heard about that panhandle um being a real like winter coverage hub of the us and you know that's a good little clue so i hope even if you're an advanced player and you're still watching although that one helped you out so end up with a sick guest there and 23 300 that's a good score even for me although we were um that we were kind of aided by some signs here actually you know if we have worked out that botswana that could have been easily a twenty four thousand no i think of it well we could have really gotten twenty four thousand there unfortunately uh anyhow that was a really good seed and uh yeah really pleased with how that one went let's keep playing let's click play again and keep going shall we so we're going to open up challenge no moving this is for the fourth seed here copy that let's get it okay so can we beat 23 300 certainly we can but we're gonna need some more luck this one's generation two remember generation two big clue for different countries um certain countries have a lot more often than others and even some countries like luxembourg and germany pretty much only have generation two um here we have an interesting house it's not got bricks on it's got a black roof hmm just looking for any signage at this point in the round i'm looking for any signage that tells us what side of the road we're driving on because i think we should be driving left hand side it looks more like a britain or ireland round than anything to me but i want to make sure we're not in france so just looking for any sign that would tell us that we're not in france here um unfortunately there's no sign set up for this like no giveaway sign right here um and it doesn't appear that there's any signs at all we have a back yellow plate here on the tractor that might mean britain that might be our savior here but that might mean britain we've got big bands in the background as well interestingly uh also a sound like this i feel like in france it would have a blue thing normally and this one's got a yellow one so i'm not sure the meaning of that but certainly could be more british i don't know we've got hedges here as well certainly a bit of an ambiguous round here it's gonna this is gonna be a tough one so i think we're on a 15 country street right now unless i've forgotten one that we missed um and for that reason it's very curious indeed so yeah this tractor the tractor literally might be the difference between my different options here ireland france and um the uk are pretty much the only options here for my money and i'm leaning i'm leaning uk because of that yellow plate i am i hope that's not an old french plate that's what i really hope but i think wales is good a good possibility here could be mid ones as well um some of these brick buildings look a little more french to me though well we're gonna have to see where everyone went in these ones it should be interesting to see how it goes i'll i'll definitely check up and see um if anyone's able to beat me who's playing along um but uh let's see here this one is probably gonna be britain i have to say it's probably gonna be britain um and i'm just gonna go for it now and this one was in northern ireland so yeah the rolling green pastures it was very green and ireland's one of the greenest places in europe to be honest so it makes sense we keep our country streak because northern ireland is part of the uk um but it was a tough round that's some mountains there as well which is not really typical for northern ireland i feel like it's kind of a baity round kind of a baby around there so yeah a tough one um but we make it out live we make it out live the uh the lack of red bricks there there's definitely more iris looking as well so maybe i should have known that uh this one's nice and easy uh we've got like three things that can basically instantly tell us it's russia and we have this uh ballard here with the red in the center i mean that blood you'll see in a bunch of different countries but with the dark red um reflector it's definitely more likely to be russia you can see in other countries too but yeah these ones are typical russia when i see these like little little stubby ones and they like to put a lot of bollards on intersections in russia um we have this pole with the black base as we discussed last time and this black car with the long antenna these two things are very much russian indeed and so i'm thinking somewhere up here again it almost looks like the uh almost looks like a similar round to the one we had last time in the last episode which was the intro um for the video so let's see if we can go there and this one yeah it was northern but it's all the way up here so presumably some people have done better than me it had a very northern feel to it there and uh yeah that's about as far north as coverage goes in russia most coverage is below this line here there's not much going on up here except that the coverage does go to mumansk there so that's why i guessed up there okay so we have all white road lines here and i think we are well we are driving left hand side of the road so that's interesting we have blue number plates here like blue text on the number plate so let's turn around before i before i blab and and say what i think it says the church in campbelltown okay so we're in a place called campbelltown certainly could be australia or new zealand and we have some australian bullets here which is really interesting i was actually thinking new zealand off the bat here um but for the reason that i was thinking new zealand and for the reason we have a lot of these possum guards i'm thinking it's going to be tasmania and the curious thing about that is that in tasmania there's not much generation four in fact most of the generation four in tasmania pretty much follows the number one which runs all the way down to hobart from launceston oh and actually it goes all the way up to devonport as well i guess and and all the way over here so um let us see if i'm right about that over here we have a possum guard which is a little bit olive green and those ones are exclusive to tasmania so i'm thinking i'm feeling pretty confident here uh this also just looks like a tasmanian number plate to me so um and also this looks like a tasmanian street light and that sounds a bit silly but i'm pretty sure it actually is so yeah i'm thinking we're probably going to be somewhere a bit more northern also these small houses when you see a lot of small houses for whatever reason test media it's i guess it's a little bit poorer it you're just more likely to find small houses so can we find a campbelltown quickly i'm looking along the number one here i don't think i see any cable towns um so maybe out north of hobart here we have a cambridge but no campbell down there i see so yeah we're just going to get somewhere along the number one here should be somewhere between these two cities and yeah oh there was campbelltown a tiny city we're very close we're very close so a good guess and actually that one could have been rather tough without the license plate um but yeah the olive green possum guard is the thing to remember because that's only in tasmania uh this one's interesting we have generation two and we're in africa and also look at this we we can see that we're driving left-hand side of the road because of the stop signs here uh because of these top um arrows here um obviously a car is going to be pulling out this way if they're turning left um so stop and stop yeah it's definitely left hand drive and because it's generation two we know it's gonna be south africa also these guys are looking pretty african are these vans uh we're not close enough but this is actually a south african flag and so you can find them they're pretty common taxis in in za um this is an african looking tree i think the trees in africa often just kind of have this like wide um canopy but they're very like short so i don't know how to describe it better than that but definitely african feeling here so it's pretty green but we also have like kind of deserty floor so i think that's pretty typical of what you'd find around pretoria and johannesburg um is it hilly at all i don't think we really see any hills here so i actually might go a bit closer to the two maybe in this town here um because i do think we're gonna be somewhere around there so without any other clues i think we're gonna be happy to go and let's see how close we are we're on the other side of the two cities um in this town here but still a good score and it's going quite well i would say so the last one is fantastic because it shows a few unique clues for this country so first off we'll observe that we have a single yellow line rather than two and we'll also observe this checkered um yellow sign here and that's pretty much all we're gonna have to observe here we've got also a wooden pole here as well but yeah the single yellow line and the checkered sign are going to be canada um only basically um what's interesting is that maybe you can find the single yellow line sometimes in the us but exceedingly rare um the dots all the way down the pole here as i said they are more common in the us but you can find them in canada clearly we have one here and uh for that reason for the reason that's so flat i'm thinking we're gonna be somewhere out in this part of the country maybe new brunswick or somewhere around here was my first thought could even be newfoundland um quite kind of has a bit of a remote feel to it now this certainly could be manitoba or saskatchewan as well it doesn't really remind me of alberta so much because it's quite i like a lot of trees i don't know if that's correct but yeah the i think it's the amount of trees that's gonna make me go over here i guess in the great plains there are less trees somewhat i don't know um but certainly we can find uh we can we could be in all the places here i'm gonna go in new brunswick i think let's see about that okay this was actually in prince edward whoops this is actually in prince edward island so a good effort and we should have snuck over 20 000 here we did indeed despite a terrible rush i guess we have still got it thanks to a good tasmanian guest thanks to a good canadian guest and uh some other decent ones there so let me look at the time here i think we will go for one more for the video and i hope you guys are really enjoying if you are be sure to like and subscribe if you made it this far you gotta like and subscribe that is how that's how we're rolling guys um but yeah i hope it's really helping you out play geoguessa it's a good fun game and the more things you know the more rewarding it is really so here we are this is the final seed for the video five seeds in one video you know you guys are luck uh so here is the first one and this one is good plenty of clues to get the country right off the bat and we're we're still maintaining a country street right we're on a we're on a 20 country street right now i think so that's good unless i've forgotten something so we are driving my hands out of the road see that by this guy here um and uh yeah this car also this is the back of the google car by the way so if you ever need to realize this is not the front this is indeed the back you can see the brake light there and so that means we're driving right inside of the road it only makes sense and check it out we've got yellow number plate yellow number plate actually not sure about this one but this is the yellow number plate you see another one over here and on the big truck has a white level plate so that is a clue normal daily drive cars have yellow number plates in colombia whereas big trucks and taxis and stuff often have white ones this one even has a green one apparently which is interesting um it also says columbia here so hopefully you guys picked that up also this sign has a white pole and that is quite common in colombia we'd probably see the colombian cross on the back of these ones unfortunately we can't make it out but this is quite quite typical columbia looking big mountains as well so as we said on a number of occasions looking at that topography is quite useful and uh yeah that's pretty much all we have to know for this one definitely typical columbia looking around right here so it's a little bit drier i'm maybe thinking a little bit north maybe somewhere out here for this one um could certainly be anywhere around here i think um but yeah it could even be further north up here as well i am considering that i think we're kind of at high altitude though so maybe somewhere here yeah actually kind of like where we've put it um but uh not really in the forest and we just have a bit of red soil so it's interesting i'm not a hundred percent sold on my guess i'm i kind of suck at guessing where in colombia luckily there are plenty of foods to get that it is colombia and this is yeah this is way further south unfortunately probably the worst guess of the video so far i want to say because we're right near veda depression so yeah i guess i guess it makes sense but that is that's not fantastic we got yellow plates all around here so yellow front plates yellow backplates um pretty much given that we see brick houses we know we're in netherlands here devindenberg definitely a germanic netherlands sounding thing nl on the domain name so this one was an absolute gift if anyone didn't get this i think you're on the right video because you're really learning a lot this is a typical netherlands round for sure so i don't think there's too much else to say here we'll go over here not really sure where abouts gonna be and we're pretty close so that's good definitely near germany there 55 kilometers away next one we have only poles that are painted white at the bottom we have a shirtless dude here chilling on the side of the road you know how it is this is a romanian scene if i've seen one uh also like some corn crops here they tend to be quite common in romania and serbia and those countries around there so definitely feeling good about that uh and yeah just these really wide holy poles with the white paint at the bottom you're basically only going to see that in romania i feel like when it's painted white it's definitely a good clue like i may have had this round before to be honest but anyway this is certainly romania so whereabouts will we guess we've got some pines i think because it's a bit drier i might go on this side of the country but to be honest i'm never really sure um but yeah i think it kind of reminds me of this side of the country more near the hills we have hills to the north yeah we have hills on all sides here so maybe somewhere uh yeah let's see that and uh well this was right down south so it was kind of correct there but it is actually near bulgaria really neat to bulgaria actually you could go there pretty quickly but that was an interesting round not the nicest looking place i've ever seen well maybe a fright that fly um but uh yeah not a bad round nonetheless good score i'll move on to the next one okay so this one is interesting we actually have a snow pole over here so this one actually will give us the country and uh but let's take a look over here we have a snow-capped mountain big one we have metal look at this we have metal poles so hopefully you guys are taking this in it's actually quite a common occurrence in this in this country uh this one is quite an ambiguous round so for you guys uh who would be struggling with around like this we're going to check up here we have the sun to the south so we're going to be in the northern hemisphere obviously if we point the compass this way we can't see the sun the cl the sun is clear to the south mean northern hemisphere this car over here it's a big clue it has a blue strip on the plate and now this country is not an eu member i think they've applied to be um but this is going to be turkey and so don't get confused you can't have blue plates in countries that are not in the eu for example israel as well um and let's check out this uh this these buildings like these tall apartment blocks definitely very common in turkey but this is the big one the snow pole this one looks like a little turkish ball out at the bottom and that's kind of multi-colored stacked turkish bollards up to the top right so it's interesting this almost looks like we've got bullet holes in it which is super interesting uh but yeah the dirt road you know this is looking very very turkish indeed and i'm thinking because it looks i don't know i'm thinking somewhere out here i feel like because it's kind of underdeveloped it's going to be somewhere out to the east i could be wrong um but also kind of looks like the usa or like canada if you look out here um so i'm gonna go out here let's see if i correct about that i know yeah this is a good guess this is a good guess maybe i should have gone a little bit further south but yeah that's good for turkey it's a big country and we take those guesses so for the final round of the video actually you know what we're gonna go speed rounds after this just to end out the country streak um but uh as for the final round of the explanations we are driving right hand side of the road here we have white road lands so always get that stuff out of the way before you um think about what country it's going to be obviously yellow road lines white road lands generally speaking um in the center so over here we have a long sided zero on a white sign this one actually could pose some problems for us oh we have a really thin bollard here with a red i would love to move to be able to see it better here though it's a really thin circular bullet with the red there could this be north macedonia again we have no antenna so that could fit with north macedonia that's something i didn't mention but you'll often see that and i feel like i feel like this card kind of has like a little bit of red on the plate i think they might do that in north macedonia as well i'm actually kind of feeling confident here about that um so just taking a look around i think they do use the long side of though what i mean is the o is not perfectly round it's got the kind of straight sides i think they do do that that's for the rest of the round it certainly could be i think i have seen these ones in north macedonia you know even though they're different to the ones we saw earlier in the episode also this yellow field inside okay i'm feeling fairly confident here let's see if we're correct about that this one's a bit flatter than the last one so perhaps yeah perhaps somewhere in this region here yeah there we go 24 kilometers away this is fantastic 22 300 and despite a terrible start we have gone well again okay so let us just continue on the video uh we're on a 25 country streak here so let's just see if i can get my record it's like 32 which go quickly and this one feels like norway to me uh we've got that longer dashes on the outside of the road feels like it's gonna be like one of these islands up here i think oops like whole computer's glitching for some reason but yep it's gonna be a island of norway hey why is it suddenly counting a streak anyway i don't know i might have state streak instead of country streetcon this one is south africa due to the uh generation two along with very african looking surroundings and we're very close there that's 62 kilometers this is a good guess um next one is uh the kenya car this is just straight up we got the we got the um roof racks and this black car it's going to be in kenya and i feel like black car interesting i think we might be like north of nairobi here maybe in one of these towns here let's see uh yeah 52 km 56 kilometers so oh man if i only tried harder on that norway i guess this one is going to be in south korea we've got korean everywhere so that makes it nice and easy so moving on to very nice scores here and uh yeah this was another good guess wow oh man i wish i tried harder on that norway we could have had a sick get a six score here um anyhow this one's interesting we've got like a green it's like a green number plate there anyway we got thought czed so we should be in czech yeah um at the end of the day here um although cars travel cars travel in europe you've got to remember that so let's just take a moment here to consider our options um yeah i mean it certainly looks like it could be in czechia i don't see why not one thing it did remind me of a little bit was slovenia though so just trying to make sure it's not hmm i don't think we're gonna get too much more confirmation though there's not many too many clues pension family that that seems like we're in a touristy area straightside oh do they use that in check yeah i think this might be baiting us to be honest do we have to trust it though i'm not entirely sure to be honest i'm not entirely sure this feels more like slovenia to me i'll be such a strong guess if i actually managed to get this and it's not trickier would you really be traveling that far with your little business car i don't know man i'm gonna feel silly if i don't if i guess that it's not checkier and then it and then it is so if we were in czech game we would be right on the border here before it gets mountainous you know what it it probably is it probably is checky come on charlie yes it is where i only bought it with germany or with the poll unsurprisingly okay so for whatever reason the country streak has just started working we're on 23 000 for a quick round there that was fantastic and uh let's just keep going until i lose my country straight here i'll give a bit more com commentary um but uh this one is going to be pole is it no we got yellow turning of blue turning arrows here so maybe france you do those in france quite a bit i think um yeah that looks to be french so let's just go france nice it is all the way in britain this one is interesting should be philippines i think i mean it should be um indonesia because they're all wearing headdresses here this one reminds me borneo this one should be somewhere in borneo i think so let's guess like somewhere all the way up here yep that is indonesia not the right country um not the right uh island for that for sure oh this one is interesting i think it's actually going to be in europe surprisingly so let's see where the sun sun is to the north oh sounds to the north hello so where are we is this mexico this couldn't be new zealand south africa okay this one's tough this one's definitely tough is this a glitch i think the sun actually is indeed to the north so we should be in the southern hemisphere here got these birds so my two thoughts are like really far north new zealand because it doesn't look like australia i think mexico wouldn't be mexican mexico's too far into the northern hemisphere so south africa is the only other option i think this has to be new zealand surprisingly although it looks nothing like new zealand for me and yeah there we are right at the north tip of new zealand a tough tough round there so moving to a 28 country streak i believe hold up no 33. um i'm actually yeah we've done yeah yeah this is 33. so holy pole i think this is my world record i'm not my world record my personal record here we got some cacti flag there was a portuguese plate so i'm just going to send it real quickly yeah um this one is going to be is that a blue spot is this going to be in france i'm not entirely sure just yet yeah it looks like france i think if we were in france we're going to be somewhere down here because it kind of looks a bit more southern to me no it's not so 10 so either that's 30 or that is um i think it's actually 30 not um 35. so this is ghana with the ghana tape there the black tape on the car uh this one is on a dirt road with a white car long antenna ooh okay so we've got a tough one here where's this going to be romania is an option here um i think it's gonna be europe based on the greenery and whatnot from me if it's not romania then i guess like be a strange france or a strange spain i think i trust my gut go romania if it's not it's not see whoa it was vladivostok so i i did think of russia but it didn't look like a black car so maybe i mean we were alright on the money with the um latitude there that was 31 country streaks i actually didn't break my record i think unless i got it wrong you guys can let me know in the comments actually what happened there i did come into my mind but this didn't look particularly asian to me um so yeah super tough around there was there any bamboo or anything can't see any anyway that was uh that was a good video thank you very much for coming along with me um i hope you guys enjoyed the explanations and whatnot and uh we got some really good scores there so yeah actually i think that was quite a successful one hopefully you guys enjoyed the implementation of the play along as well so i'll see you guys in a video soon catch you later ", "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/b6HdglDJ6p5YufbZ", "data/images_zi8gzag/bKAao0Q5YnR0QkzQ",

there are about 70 countries also covered by google maps um and the rest of them only have unofficial coverage and so this map called unexplored world allows you to play on all the other countries that are not normally included in geoguess maps that i play on everyday videos so this one is quite unique you guys have probably seen me play it before but it's really a good fun time every single time i give it a go so i'm gonna say we're gonna do two minute challenges links are in the description if you want to play along otherwise just play along with me as you watch the video right two minutes per round let's get straight into the first one here which looks probably somewhere indian i would say judging by the language here could be elsewhere as well let's take a look around at what clues we have going on here so it's hilly so that definitely eliminates some parts of india but not others we have banana plants so a little more tropical or at least a little bit more of a wet climate here um the language i'm trying to make sure it's not burmese because if i look at this language over here it does kind of look like the language you see in myanmar so i'm getting in here yeah it's definitely similar if it's not the same language it's definitely similar over the border in india here they use like uh i think they do use a script over here but a lot of latin script and over here sanskrit so i actually think we are going to be somewhere in myanmar here maybe over this section where it probably gets a little greener so taking one more look at round at the round i think the number plates are black here which i'm not actually sure what they use over in myanmar but the architecture does fit from what i understand and we're driving right hand side of the road as well so we can't be in india so actually i'm pretty i'm feeling pretty good about this gas let's see there's something 61 kilometers away okay a fantastic fantastic start to the video well we're in this town here which is actually quite a sizable city really um but yeah 61 kilometers is fantastic the next round here is in the middle east we can immediately tell that i'm thinking like qatar or something but taking a look at this flag here that might be a uae flag and that one i'm not so sure on okay these flags here what is that kuwaiti flag i think maybe yeah i think that might be the kuwaiti flag there um we'll we'll take a look around here to see if we can see anything um that substantiates that suspicion um definitely just a lot of what you'd expect to see in the middle east very flat and massive skyscrapers it looks pretty cool it's a pretty cool looking city but um i'm pretty sure kuwait city would make sense here um maybe i'm pretty sure a lot of these locations do have the compass working correctly so we could probably work out what kind of road angle we're probably on this road here i'd say although we don't see any big roundabouts which is probably what we would want to see although i could easily see there being a roundabout over there in the blur and over there as well maybe so i think we're going to be somewhere around here maybe maybe it's this road actually in fact that one makes much more sense so i'm going to say we're like right there um right near the center of the city and on that road which has the correct angle now i'm pretty much just basing that off the flag but actually the landscape and everything does also fit so let's see and something 1.2 kilometers away and and i was actually on this road here but uh tell me if you got that one as well i mean i doubt many of you started as well as i have here it's a very very nice start indeed this one i feel like we may have had this round before uh anyway no but well i don't think we have actually but it says um republic of the host of yeah ivory coast yeah ivory coast i couldn't quite make out what it said but i thought with that flag we should be in the ivory coast it's like the uh irish flag but reversed and yeah so irish i mean so in ivory coaster what country would we be crossing into here it's actually kind of hard to tell yeah this sign doesn't have another flag either so i'm wondering where we're crossing into obviously right hand drive that's the entirety of west africa we do have french here on this side of the border um so what does it say we're entering or exiting i wonder you know i actually think that doesn't necessarily mean this is a country border what i actually think is that this is like probably a provincial border or something like that it's very green uh relatively flat and there's not too much to say about it it's fairly generic i do wonder if we could see the town name on one of these ones though um doesn't necessarily seem like we will be able to although i'm sure if you knew what you were looking for you would find one okay so getting into the map here ivory coast right here this one might feel more coastal to me it feels fairly built up and ivory coast is not too densely populated although a lot of these um villages don't show up um as having big populations even though they probably do uh so i'm kind of just buying my time here because i don't really know where to get so i'm just going to go kind of near the coast here because it feels quite green to me and it ends up being here just in the old capital i think abidjan is the old capital pretty sure that's the new capital but yeah um another nice guess another nice guess for sure next one here we have a mosque so somewhere in the middle east is feeling immediately likely otherwise central asia or something like that um yeah i bet that's a flag there or something but it's kind of obscured by the palm trees here language i always get scared is it actually arabic or could it be urdu or something like that i'm never quite sure what to say with these ones and yellow and yellow and white curb is interesting as well so i'm hoping that we can see a flag here that would be ideal oh the mosque like i did like pakistan until i realized we are driving right hand side of the road here so probably not pakistan indeed i thought maybe with that green flag was possible um but okay we have a flag there maybe syrian or it's red it's a red white and black so it's definitely useful um can we see another one down there it seems like it might have some green on it as well sudan could it be sudan i don't think the people look sudanese but to be fair yeah these signs don't look very sudanese okay so i'm just i'm just trying to base off the flag where would we be with green on the flag as well i don't think iraq fits um where is this actually yeah definitely definitely right hand drive definitely and double yellow line as well it's a lot there's a lot about this round that's kind of confusing me but it is really nice looking around as well could it be afghanistan with the black white is there a bit of green where did i see the green on the flag it was down here wasn't it yeah this was this is the one i was looking for it's kind of hard to say i'm actually not too sure where to guess here i think iraq but uh i don't think the flag fits so i'm just gonna kind of have to hope that uh it's nearby there and i'm missing something otherwise yeah i don't i don't think of a single country that makes sense possibly apart from sudan so could i guess there wouldn't be entirely unreasonable but i feel like the double yellow line would make more sense for for iraq than sudan i guess we'll find out oh man it was baghdad i did not expect to be clicked in the right city there okay this is by far and away my best ever attempt at unexplored world so will we get a kind fifth round and end up with my best score by far so we can end up with a 24 000 here it is possible if we get the right city so let's see uh yellow rear plate here oh this one it feels gettable it feels gettable somewhere in northern africa i'd say we're definitely driving right i definitely have some arabic and some latin script on the plates here we've got a bit of english as for the people probably feeling more so actually hard to say more so middle east and maybe than north african but they could be either for sure it's kind of pixelated anyway lots of walls around the houses here man i really want to get a good score here i'm going to use all my time to make sure i get the best score i possibly can yeah the yellow plate there that's the confusing bit anyone here going to give us any clues about themselves not really okay so it's it's coming the time to really start getting into the map and thinking here but nothing's coming there could it be syria could be i don't hate syria here um but i feel like i feel like there's also is definitely something about the round that gives me quite a north african feeling as well this tree almost feels like one you'd see in tunisia or something like that very similar to the kind of retries you get in australia as well so i am kind of thinking blue and white curve is very interesting not something i'm familiar with so could it be like a northern libya it could be it could be or northern i don't think it's algeria i don't think it's algeria and the short plates aren't european style so that also makes me think more so middle east and north africa where they they're more european influenced i guess so maybe i do kind of like syria instead here still doesn't feel filled with confidence it could even just be iraq again you know why don't i like iraq maybe that is a better shot ten seconds to go here gotta make my decision in a second you know what i'm gonna switch i'm gonna switch last second here this might be silly but i kind of feel better about it oh man it was libya so libya i was going to click over here it would have been a good score we still would have got a few thousand still 19 000 is a great score on this map and man it was it was it was a valiant effort i just thought they might have different license plates in libya but um okay so i'll try and remember that for next time it would have been very hard to get a high score there because it wasn't in the capital or anything but i'm very very pleased with that result and let us see what we can what we can make of the next attempt here guys so uh do go ahead click this link inside the description and play it before you watch me and let's see let's see what ends up happening on an unexplored world this time so we had some interesting countries that there some africa some asia uh this one we're driving left that is interesting so i'm immediately thinking of cyprus here when you see like a very dry country are driving left it is often cyprus because uh because they're british influence over there um and then everything i think fits here i'm looking for maybe some greek language or something like that which you often see in cyprus i don't necessarily see any of that just yet so but it's not gonna be malted because on the standard map we already have um and i can't really think of anywhere else it could be also like it's very type cypriot or whatever you say um whatever the exonym or whatever it is is this uh is this black and white curve that's very very very cyprus like i would say so yeah i'm pretty sure we're just going to be there and uh nicosia um if that is the capital um yeah necosia seems like a good a good kind of round here although it is it is relatively flat and the round itself is flat as well and the rest of the country is quite mountainous so i actually think necrosia is a really good shot here let's find out ends up being uh in lima seoul uh that probably explains why we had so much english around i'm pretty sure that's like more the english sector in fact uh that is the united kingdom right here so um but yeah 4.6 is definitely a good start on a map like this okay the next one feels kind of eastern european um so maybe belarus maybe belarus this time uh we have a little red thing on the plate here ky could those be kyrgyzstan plates i think i said ky unless it's belarus i mean belarus is similarly similarly has a red flag yeah it is going to be b l i guess okay what actually is it b b y that's right b y is better as i remember now so yeah the red and the green so that that should indicate belarus is pretty obvious here uh the question is where in belarus and i'm not too sure i was thinking of like gomel or one of these like southern towns it just kind of reminds me of that area although i'm really not familiar enough with belarus to have a proper idea here it's kind of just a very vague feeling that i have what should be the other side of the country for sure um but uh yeah yeah i'm definitely feeling good about belarus these these license plates were very helpful indeed and uh okay so let's let's uh get in here and guess oh man it was gomel i should have gone with my gut i don't think i've ever had that round before i think that was just pure instinct and a bit of dumb luck but you know we take it uh so we're still we're still on track for a really good score on this one as well i've been very consistent there here we have black number plates we're driving right hand side of the road this one's africa this this lady looks african uh so there's this gentleman here or it could be it could be elsewhere um this almost feels awesome a principe okay so that's um i'm not sure that was exactly what i was thinking but yeah here we are we're gonna be somewhere here forget uh who that belongs to but i'm assuming we're gonna be on the main island here and so um probably just in the capital city or something like that so around reebok um yeah that is a really useful sign we take those every day of the week and uh yeah it's quite an interesting looking place southampton principe and so i think that should be spanish although could it be no i guess it's actually portuguese i'm pretty sure it's portuguese you have to tell me the comments guys but yeah sal i think is uh is portuguese rather than spanish so um let us guess in like saotome here this kind of region i assume we're going to be the capital or somewhere along the coast here yeah 800 meters away fantastic stuff basically what i expected okay so we're still on a fantastic score and this one should be belarus again do we see the red on the plates here not really and actually yeah well this is a soviet-style crossing sign so i think belarus is quite safe indeed what does this say militia or militia it must must be like a barracks or something like that i think well you can tell me if i'm wrong but that's what i'm assuming uh interesting like reddish number play here for the police car but that would make sense for him to be parked at the militia um okay so yeah belarus it is this oh might actually go for well it won't be minsk it won't be minced because minsk actually has official coverage it's the only place in belarus that does has a bit of tracker and so elsewhere in belarus um why not why not um why not this one i want to click a major city i don't want to go gramel again because we just had it could be breast as well um does it feel very how far west does it feel it actually does kind of well it feels like a big city i couldn't say it feels like um like very far west but it does feel like a big city so let's go for that oh man it was in pinsk so there we go i think there's a lot of coverage in the south in this map that's what i've noticed but hey we're still on for a pb score here if i uh if i 5k this round and this one will be somewhere in in um vietnam based on this language vietnamese i'm pretty sure and so let's not look at that um longchai what does that say a long long something um a lot of the time uh in vietnam you have very good information on these signs so i think kanto should be the actual name of the city here and we even have these street name so let's let's get in here and find kanto i'm pretty sure that's a bigger city um yeah there it is kanto and so let's try and find the street as well so durong we're on durong street um which should be fairly major i mean taking a look around here we we are on like a double lane road and we have like another double lane road coming over to our south here so we're kind of going east west we have a big one to our south um and so the name was once again uh so what's the name of that one there that's when um [Music] it's not it's not immediately coming to me this uh this uh drawn street um okay not to worry though not to worry it could be this one here oh won't tell us what it's called though oh yeah durong nguyen well i haven't pronounced it so um yeah and so then nin clown i don't know i'm pretty sure it is it's somewhere along this road and so number 30 um what what number would we have here is the question we can actually 5k this okay we we know it's like intersecting like a major one here and that's okay what do we have here what's this business called it's kind of a complicated name i'm looking for something simple i can use to pinpoint this um nothing's nothing's really easy i guess yen vietnam [Music] and it could be that one but it's another like separated double main road so it has to be one of the two i'm in so on the wrong road there interesting i guess uh yeah maybe it's more of a general general name for that area anyway we get 23 111 which is my pb score for this map so back to back insane rounds here not not the hardest rounds to be fair to be fair but um but nevertheless very very enjoyable and very very uh good efforts from me i would say so gotta tell me if you guys beat me but let's do one more of a quick final one we'll do one minute per round for the last one here tonight and uh we'll see we'll see how we go i mean i'm just i'm just enjoying myself on the unexplored world man and you know what it is like it's good to see that i can do this stuff with that meta like i'm not using i'm not using any like google stuff it's all about it's all about what we see in the round and i'm very happy with that this architecture like reminds me of iran or somewhere around iran um it kind of from it's like a bit like turkey but not quite long number plate here short number plate here not really sure what that would say i think iran generally uses long number plates though so somewhere in the north would make sense here because it is a little dry but also plenty of greenery as well so maybe up here maybe up here is what i was kind of thinking kurdistan area i think so i feel like that's that's a decent shout because it would be quite turkey influenced and all this architecture definitely just reminds me a lot of turkey so i think that's what i'm gonna go for let's find out okay not terrible lebanon was another one that came to mind for whatever reason though just didn't um i just preferred iran so interesting that we saw a short number plate there wouldn't have really expected that from um from lebanon this one feels like central america in fact i may have had this one before okay so it says alto on the street here which is what they use for stop in central america so mexico through to panama i would say um so anywhere in there would make sense here i feel like i had this random it was costa rica but i could be wrong um they're using kilometers per hour uh school zone there okay okay uh concrete pole here seems to be a round concrete pole so that's that's that's good metaphor later on um do we have any domain or anything i could be wrong i don't specifically remember the round we have short number plates so that's that's also quite a central american thing to have um yeah actually maybe i've never had this one before but i think i've had similar coverage in in costa rica somewhere near san jose so we know we won't be in san jose because that does it's another like loan capital city that does have official coverage so i'm just going to go here and okay was actually in san jose so yeah definitely never actually had that round before because i probably would have remembered that it actually was in san jose regardless we get a good score that's a good start next one here we have interesting plates here a lot of this round is interesting actually blue number plate there uh and we have what looks to be like a similar script to tie uh so i think we're probably going to be in laos here i think we're probably gonna be in last in fact i think i recognize these plates as loud plates um okay what does this say here on nittaya yeah yeah that definitely feels like laotian language as well so are we driving right hands out of the road can we see that this guy's definitely pulled up on the right so it's very green should be somewhere on the thai border i would say well not really sure zeno would that have like uh would that be green enough i wonder maybe even just up in these mountains would make more sense bang bean could make sense here i don't mind that but somewhere in the mountains i think i don't see any big mountains in our background but uh i think just with this level of greenery it would make more sense although yeah i'm not really too familiar with laos in in the beginning so let's see okay nice fantastic guest man i just can't i'm just walking on sunshine i just cannot make a mistake today apart from if it's in libya apparently okay so here's the next round uh this one um okay oh el salvador i think the o-r at the end of this number plate would make me think that and these colors would make me think el salvador all the way here so looks we're on track for another another good score here um yeah el salvador does seem extremely likely um restaurante yes this one's a little dry it's hilly look at these cowboy hats okay okay well this is recent maybe they're wearing masks it could be recent coverage um yeah the infrastructure and everything about the round feels very el salvador so i'm happy to assume that that that that license plate is not lying and san salvador seems like a as good option as any so i'm just gonna go for it ends up being right on the other side of the country and l source nuts i like that i like that it's my my new favorite town in el salvador for sure last round of the video we're in night time now night night mode guesser uh black and white um like signpost here makes me think of maybe vietnam seems like we are driving maybe left though so maybe it's actually india i think they do that in india as well a bit of english here so that that would also fit perhaps times square feels quite like it feels like like south or like east asia though for india i'm not saying it couldn't be india i think the white road lines and everything would kind of fit front license plate i think india does that as well so yeah and definitely not going to count india out here 24 seconds to go is it india or is it vietnam well obviously it's not vietnam but the left-hand drive but well i think the lifetime drive countries would be covered so i'm just going to go for india here um maybe southern it's kind of like near chennai chennai i think that feels decent it's fairly green we didn't see any language though we didn't see any indian language and she could be indian although i'm not really sure okay it was india in gujarat um in rajkot so man all these crazy massive indian cities that i've never even heard of i forgive me but i don't know about our raj caught the city but that's crazy a thousand points we end up with a four country streak we i think we got like i think we got actually like 13 out of 15 countries correct in in the video as far as i can remember so that's an impressive effort guys thank you very much watching all the way to the end had a lot of fun with this one and i'll see you guys in another video tomorrow so till then ", "image_not_available": [4], "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/7K2KeHdLST0bRKCU", "data/images_zi8gzag/897d1f5GgDlQPMXj",

we're gonna be doing some of the training seeds leading up to these proper seeds now it is the 21st today so the deadline for all these pre-season rounds uh but i'm just gonna do the training seeds uh for today's upload and then maybe tomorrow or the day after i'll bring you my actual attempts at the proper uh links here so uh first off i'll let us go with oceania then we're gonna do new zealand africa lesotho europe and spain all these practice seeds we'll see how we go um and yeah that's pretty much it let's just see how we're stacking up with the competition so i know what to practice a little bit this evening before i actually play them so here we go it's oceania um and it's two minutes per round so hopefully we get some more australia on this one but uh we'll see we'll see so this one we have like two yellow um dots in the center we should also turn around here and see an antenna and that's right and then we also have this little bar visible and so you often see this antenna that antenna can be uh in puerto rico but obviously that's not part of oceania and then it's also out here in guam and the northern mariana islands however when you do see this little bar here that means you know you're in guam and uh so we're looking at guam here we see some like bigger hills over here and they are over to our north so i'm not really sure if that road will be covered but it's probably something like this so let's see we were 5.6 kilometers away this was the actual location um but yeah not really not really trying to get 5k just trying to get a good score so this one's new zealand no chance that it's australia it looks too green too hilly this rock these rock hills wouldn't make sense for australia um we only have one ball out here so actually kind of a difficult round i mean could this be australia i don't think so i think like all these kind this kind of like bush here as well very new zealandy and also just the fact that it's really nice generation four uh i'm thinking north island here but i'm not really sure when i don't know i often just go around here it kind of reminds me of this kind of area here as well neonapia perhaps i like that let's see so this one was north island 4000 points is pretty good i might put that so next one okay very blurry coverage here we've got like a big car here i'm pretty sure this is american samoa this big black kind of a pickup truck here can't remember exactly what the rules are for americans more but i think that's the main island car as far as i remember so i think it's this one here so we were in a town we've got ocean over here to our east and hills to our west so yeah maybe something like this we're not quite driving along the beach but we're nearly doing that so maybe something like this would make sense i like that let's see uh okay so actually over on this side of the island probably could have optimized that a bit better but ultimately we're just trying to get decent scores not fantastic ones so now australia so far unfortunately this one's back in new zealand again we've got these new zealand bullets here and here and uh yeah just quite healing i actually watched a movie in from new zealand last night boy a 2010 movie by a maori um like director pretty good pretty good movie i i quite enjoyed it yeah let me know in the comments if you've seen it but yeah i think this is north island um could easily be south island the longer i look at it this is quite southern vegetation to be fair kind of reminds me of a similar climate to kangaroo island so that would put us around there but yeah i'm not actually really sure maybe maybe just a similar area over here again or maybe like north of the south island i don't really know we got we got ocean to the north so maybe we could go for something like this or something like this i don't really know i'm with new zealand i'm really unsure a lot of the time wow this was super fun north and actually someone's going to 5k i've seen yeah when the man gets it so not really sure why i struggled with that so much it seemed like not too hard of a round and here's the final one not working i should also turn off my uh script when i actually do the seeds by the way but anyway i'm not really sure what is going on with this so i guess we'll just guess in i don't really know where they have a lot of broken locations let's just guess in the east coast of australia i guess and it is where okay and not being pretty close there so there we go let's see uh what the breakdown was here unfortunately black screen it's kind of a kind of empty points the fact that we got the right estate here is just quite random but yeah let's check out um like what people did here so yeah it seems like pretty pretty much everyone getting in the right spots in the top five and then you know some some fairly low scores here but ultimately um seems like anyone who knew the matters would kind of getting up in that 19 000 point range uh so i'll let us head into the next one this one is new zealand so as i've said new zealand not really my strong suit here so let's see okay this one definitely reminds me of north island with the gum trees here taking a look around it's fairly flat um fairly green i i i'm just gonna go on instinct with new zealand because i'm not really so sure but that one is near auckland so 3200 is a good start uh next one like heavily forested here ferns everywhere but again feeling decently warm not really sure what i think i i kind of want to go on like one of these islands or something like that i don't know which ones have coverage here maybe this one here otherwise it could just be like on this coast here but yeah i'm just going to go in the auckland again okay this one was over here in this national park so that could be could be good to remember but yeah not a good score obviously this one reminds me more of south island now with these like long route rows of trees but yeah i'm really kind of a noob at this uh when it comes to like south island and north island stuff big mountains in the background and they're over to our north as well so yeah i think somewhere around christchurch could work here otherwise somewhere near dunedin as well this one feels quite cold so i'm actually going to opt for this road near dunedin and okay christchurch would have been the better call here 1 300 points so yeah i've really got a maybe just some more hedging would be better when i actually get to the cedia because yeah new zealand not not my strong point this one is kind of interesting because it definitely feels relatively cold but this one's kind of more neutral to me so maybe south of the north island or north of the south island big mountains in the background though so i think i will go north of the south island this time maybe somewhere around here yeah i like that i like that let's see okay this one was actually quite far south so we've got the island right every time as far as i remember but oh no we didn't one time we got it wrong but you know it's uh it's tough it's tough okay this one definitely reminds me of like wellington this kind of bay here so yeah we can see that over to the south this looks like wellington to me um as for the surroundings is there much to say here kind of like they kind of use like chilean style poles which is interesting in new zealand but uh yeah i don't want to take too much time it's just the training seed um so i think wellington if we're looking over to the south there and seeing the rest of the bay maybe something like this area here but that makes sense i think this is wellington regardless yeah we were over here okay so there we go ten thousand points and uh of course i mean that's okay we got wellington we got auckland oh that was the only one i guessed the wrong island for with that tracker coverage and then these two you know it wasn't too bad 10 000 points let's see where that put us i just want to know in terms of the other players so 10th out of 19 not fantastic new zealand's a tough tough country especially for me for whatever reason but yeah even even lenny um getting getting that one wrong and still getting 16k so clearly he's been putting in the work but uh let's get on to the next one which is africa so i feel like africa is one of these ones where i probably won't need to practice too much but let's see what we get okay so the first one looks like s martini white car yellow road lines long grass lots of trees uh kind of going north to south ish i like oh wow we have to actually get this pretty close because yeah we have to get these pretty close oh no no it's the african around i was thinking this was the last around anyway i think like somewhere along here along these borders makes sense because i think they have a lot of pine trees around there so let's go there and okay we're pretty close here 29 kilometers away we're around there uh so i think i was clicking around here so either one would have been a good guess um so we get next huh south africa probably somewhere out in the outback for south africa um interesting this sign they normally use the red and the yellow one the red and the white one of these but yeah it's pretty rural i think somewhere out here makes a lot of sense um let's go for that i don't really know yeah okay other side of johannesburg it gets very dry out that direction um but we're still we're still sitting on a good school here so that's good this one is kenya um yeah i think this one is going to be red soil yeah this one is feeling like it's on the way out of nairobi somewhere towards eldora or kisumu kisumu um but yeah really looking around there's a lot of pines it's pretty cool um but i don't see any like like we'd have to find this place if we if we actually want to find the spot i'm not really sure if that's possible nor nor if i want to spend the three minutes actually looking for it so i guess we'll just find like some forest this is a forest here i'm really sure if it travels along some of these white highways probably more so the yellow ones but yeah i think that's at least good i do remember like kind of this red soil being more on this side of the country but you never know it could also be up here so we'll see i guess and okay we're very close there we're actually not into the top three yet but that was a good guess that was a good guess seems like most people getting in that area this one looks like nigeria but i guess we'll turn around and find out with the car yeah this one should be a nigeria car these poles they're definitely used in nigeria as well so lagos area seems likely here let's see if we can read anything um mountain office miracles ministries so not any location on there unfortunately well seems to be english speaking so that's really good ireland's best online tires interesting i wonder if this car like somehow made its way to um nigeria from ireland or if it's just randomly a company that operates also in nigeria interesting to think about regardless with this like kind of greenery the dirt road we don't have a follow car which is probably intentional for the seed but i would say it's probably going to be like lagos a new benin city it's pretty much between lagos and enugu for me i think i'll just go lagos here seems like a reasonable hedge let's see okay we were in lagos so last round here let's see how we go lesotho easy to this one feels fairly high up in the mountains so i'm thinking somewhere in the center or further over this direction treeless a small town here so yeah why don't we go around here i'm not really sure with lesotho but let's see if we're close and okay we are super close there actually probably the best guess of them all so we get 23.3 and that's kind of what i expected like the only uh bad guess was here and the rest of them were pretty much on point so let's see if we actually got um near the top there will we get top three okay we actually got third so that's pretty nice indeed um and then yeah low score 12 000 people mostly getting above 22 000 if they're good players so yep still pretty happy with that and a nice let's use you guess to end it off as well okay so here we have lesotho let's see if i can keep that form running then so here is another one that is looking more eswatini than lesotho i would say at this stage hold up for us the lasso map i'm actually dumb uh anyway putting that behind us um so probably around mazuru or something like that that's where it's like looks more like this i would suggest somewhere somewhere along this section of the country i would say um looks more like eswatini than um or not not more but yeah it looks like espartini more than over here which is like very alpine almost uh like we had in the last round so um yeah i don't really know we're kind of going east to west here kind of nor well we're kind of like going diagonally like this kind of like direction here so of course that could be possible uh in terms of mountains we have like we definitely have some to our north as well so that would fit yeah it seems like most of them are kind of like southern from us so yeah i kind of like this i think it's going to be somewhere up here to mars let's see and okay we are actually the closest so far only 1.4 k though so not the best next one this one's more typical probably of inland somewhat oh this one i would just i'll probably just hedge near the center for this one it's it's it's the mountains are not too high here we're kind of almost on like a plane so i'm kind of looking at like kind of this section over here as well as possible um we're on a dirt road so i'm not really sure how that works in terms of the coverage but yeah i think it's i think i actually kind of like that just because it feels a little flatter here than what a lot of these roads would just be right inside the mountains whereas you know this one over here seems to have some flatness to it road angle we'll try and get that correct seems like once again we're kind of heading in this direction here something like that uh i don't really think this bend quite fits what we want though so maybe i should go here okay let's go for that oh okay so actually quite southern here on this white road and uh near the national park okay so i'll try and remember what that looks like regardless we dropped quite a few points there and len gets a nice one okay next uh okay um very very rural here this one again kind of more feeling like the south of the country like this kind of area again to me mountains are big so i think this one is going to be on the east here somewhere on the west side on the west here somewhere on the western border um got some like courses just roaming free some like she's wearing the traditional um lesotho dress which is pretty cool um but uh yeah this one's interesting more of a flat plane as well again this time and we're going well kind of up this direction here so maybe i am thinking of something like this this time but that makes sense with the hills we do see them to our north quite big that's reasonable enough then we have kind of a flat area to our like southwest there so that does not fit what about over here this kind of fits better flat area to our southwest okay and then kind of bigger to our north okay yeah okay so i think this fits otherwise we're probably gonna be somewhere over here like north of mazaru but yeah i'm not really sure here okay this one's decent guest decent guess 700 points is fine for the zooto i feel like we're actually just in the mountains so i need to remember that the white will the white roads are often covered as well the white roads are often covered as well here's the next one this one feels just more like the center of the country again to me this one's similar to the one we had down near the national park but i think i like something just like like a nice center hedge reminds me of that kind of area so i'm just going to go here we'll see and okay we were pretty close again and actually maybe this was 5k above because uh lenny gets it but he seems like he's the only one and we're still we're still maintaining top three status here so he's definitely smoking everyone else yeah okay this one we have like a red or dirt which is interesting uh definitely feels like high up we've got some like uh what would you say we've got some like farmland here which is interesting you don't want to see that i'm thinking like kind of this area here would make most sense just because we we seem to be near a town or right in like what feels to be like the tall parts of the mountains and uh yeah yeah and it feels quite cold so i'm just gonna go for that let's see and okay actually ends up being quite central there interestingly so we get three thousand um nine hundred points these two guesses were both good i'm pretty good at recognizing that area of the country these two um if we were able to swap them interestingly after seeing round four i pretty much clicked on the same place subconsciously but all these three guesses were okay but okay only uh and so let's see if we managed to maintain top three probably not yeah we dropped down to number five there are pretty close among the 3 900 boys here so definitely uh lesotho will be one i work on before i record the actual video regardless here we go with europe and um let's see how we go this one is another one i shouldn't need too much uh practice with this one uh this language probably reminds me more of croatian i want to see white painted bottom of the pole but these poles could easily be croatian as well i feel do we have any shutters on the windows we i can't really tell if their shot is actually what about over here a lot of the times yeah yeah these look like shutters so i do think i do think crois is my favorite here um yeah so what about antenna we have no antenna so do we see any cyrillic because that would be another so nicola that's definitely a balkan name um but i don't think we see any cereal like here which is interesting so yeah maybe maybe maybe um maybe croatia does make more sense here than than serbia so yeah but these buildings could certainly be serbian as well i kind of feel like just going around um zagreb would be a good hedge here seeing as how it's pretty rural as well i kind of want to go like kind of over here on the border kind of like guarantee ourselves some points so let's see if we're right about that okay ends up actually being in serbia so perhaps a little unfortunate that we couldn't see any cyrillic there but um at least we went on that half of croatia so yeah europe was my always my weak point this one maybe greece let's take a look around here winter coverage so okay so looks like italian actually i think this is going to be italian what is this store can't actually read the name of it we probably have blue on both sides of that number plate i'm assuming let's see this car not really visible um but yeah this this should be uh it definitely looks like italian rather than other languages to me euros far interesting so yeah in terms of italy i'm thinking maybe more southern here even though it's generation four maybe more southern so something like that it could be northern as well but we don't see any mountains so i'm just trying to think of it if it's a bait round or if it's just like this but yeah there's our italian plate this is right in front of me the whole time but yeah let's just go there let's find out okay this one was way up north so not a good score not a good score okay kind of unfortunate i feel like that was a bit of a tough round here's the rapper h um but we're not speaking english here uh neuer music so maybe um that that looks probably like um hungarian to me but actually it's probably no it's actually going to be dutch because strat is dutch and i think this might be belgium but no we know we do have a we do have yellow plates so actually netherlands but interesting that h he's a british rapper interesting that he's advertised on the bins over there um so anyway let's take a look at this uh plenty of going on lucky it wasn't nnpz because i probably would have been tempted to go britain but yeah it would have been a tough tough to get away from that for sure take hoop so nl yes we already know we're in netherlands this feels like a capital city to me this feels like it could be amsterdam rotterdam something like that maybe rotterdam just because it just felt like belgium i think i might go there but yeah somewhere hague hey even maybe hague is a nice hedge between them i'll go for that see here okay actually is amsterdam and someone even managing the 5k here no surprises there but we're still getting less cool next one baltic baltic or russian russian probably actually so taking a look around here we have a russian long antenna ah but it feels kind of baltic so somewhere probably further north also these barn houses almost feel like lithuanian to me so i'm tempted to go somewhere around there around here or something like that could even be further north maybe just somewhere out here in like the saint petersburg vicinity um yeah so yeah pretty chill i'm happy with that it's going to be a bigger town actually we do see some high rises so let's go right there and okay this was ukraine we couldn't actually quite see the ukrainian car there so that was quite a hit to our points now just trying to think was there anything that i could have actually used there perhaps not so i don't feel too bad about that we at least got somewhat in the right direction and this one feels like scotland with the uh well we're driving left hand side of the road we've got rock walls we've got like big bear mountains um could it be whales possibly i like scotland better here so i'm just gonna slam it in [Music] let's see here over here let's go for that will this be close okay actually in yorkshire in this national park here so maybe it should have known better than that but we still pull 3k points so let's see where that puts us in the rankings here it was definitely a tough seat i think these are made to be tough we're your bottom we're your bottom i did not expect that the italy gas was the real issue there uh and then the ukraine one apparently more people picked up on or at least got closer than i did which is interesting uh and then round three was five cables so i think i'm gonna do better when we get like a a different seat i think it was just this probably plays into i don't know we'll see we'll see i don't want to develop for too long wasn't really trying all that hard but uh let's go for the last one of today's video whoops um did not mean to invite um orpheus to this but here is the last one this is spain dry is anything here it's gonna be somewhere around madrid north or south is the question i feel south i feel south this is quite deserty just gonna go off vibes here i think let's see and it ends up being near madrid as i said 2.3 k not terrible not great but yeah the madrid hedge pays off there for the people who didn't um so yeah spanish boulevard some vineyards here some towns this one again feels southern to me am i am i uh deceiving myself though maybe i will go out for this direction you have valencia or something like that i'm just gonna go for that see okay ends up being a nice guess we had we don't move up to the top three but we end up being pretty close there so that's good next one our el cap carpio a306 okay i don't wanna find a three or six i still want to just go five so let's take a look see where i would put it otherwise if i wasn't going for the for this actual highway it feels like a pretty similar area this time i i think i actually prefer some up here near zaragoza so let us take a look and see if we can see the a306 um so a numbers are probably smaller yeah a numbers are smaller so let's just see if it's anywhere around here so we can get an insane guess but i'm assuming we cannot yes a lot of 100 ones around here let's see if down here there's more 300 ones these are two thousands and three hundreds here okay three hundreds are over here so maybe we are actually over here a103 we want the 306. so just triple that number and we've got it right uh okay i i think there are more 3000s down here i still want to go with my gut though i do still want on my gut go want to go with my gut it feels more northern or this building kind of feels african though no no lie okay and also i would be great if i knew about this spot but yeah i'm not really sure so i'm just gonna go on my guy here let's see ends up being southern where the three thousands were okay so i will keep that in mind if we have another um highway number i will keep that in mind but uh yeah not too good not too good there this one feels like a bigger city bigger town so it almost feels south american with this architecture i must say um of course it is not though ah southern i'm not really sure this one this one because we we've got so much uh so many trees were like uh kind of obscuring our vision it's not an easy run that's for sure um so where do we want to go here somewhere on the coast i think marissa like somewhere somewhere over here i don't really know valencia even could be near barcelona here to be honest feels pretty green so maybe i will actually go up here instead let's go for that okay this one was outside of madrid i would never have expected that i feel really coastal to me 800 points not not fantastic obviously the points are a little bit inflated compared to other countries because of um the canary islands of course okay this is the final one again it's kind of like a vibes one i think i think the good old madrid hedge is kind of working wonders let's see if let's see if it goes well again i mean more towards portugal this time let's go uh here okay actually over this direction near zaragoza that time so yeah it seems like uh some other people liked my logic but eight thousand five hundred i guess they're gonna be pretty low again this time yep quite low again so spain pretty tough but a lot of people getting in kind of the same area here unfortunately this is the last day that i can actually do any practice i have not done any practice yet and um i'm pretty much out the whole evening so i pretty much have to record the next one off the bat off the back of this we're doing a little bit of practice perhaps but uh yeah the fact that people were 5k some of these rounds pretty crazy um he must be this guy this guy must be spanish right uh but yeah that's that's it that's it for the training seeds um so this is what i have to do now i have to play these there's mystery world challenges as well and then there's these three as well so we're just gonna have to see how i do with that play each week as they come uh well no we're gonna play each each week at once but i'll probably split it up into three videos or something like that uh regardless thank you very much for watching i'll see you guys in a video very soon and uh yeah i hope you guys enjoyed uh seeing the training process till next time bye bye ", "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/9aDnt2XwMEb9f1QH", "data/images_zi8gzag/XDlzyoV6nP6XfC6O", "data/images_zi8gzag/LsutdRFMp1Hhhp84",

"transcript": "yeah that should be the restaurant there and we're actually going to be here i think and we have the beach here following along and then the city should be coming along and then we should have city right there what is going on guys it's zigzag here welcome back to another geoguessr video today we are playing city skylines a map made by rc essentially it gives you a distant shot of the city from the google car and you have to try and guess without moving where in the world you are and uh will hopefully provide us the opportunity to get some sick guesses and so this one will also be a play along so i'll have the links for all the games in the description so you can play along before you watch etc uh another thing two things i wanted to mention one is that i got an instagram it's in the description linked under every video go follow me there and write up this post just posted this this afternoon so yeah run it up for your boy and also i want to give a shout out to harry bowman or bauman however you pronounce it but he like comments on a bunch of my videos with a whole bunch of like knowledge whenever i ask a question it seems like he's got the answer but i was looking at his channel he's only got 10 subs and hardly gets any views but his videos are really good he has an incredible general knowledge so you should definitely check him out have the opportunity with 2000 subs to give someone a shout out so definitely go subscribe to harry because his videos are really nice so yeah let's get straight into the first one here um and uh yeah let's put it on a challenge link we're gonna go no moving with no time limit so i just want to try and get some really good scores today that's i'm in the mood for some good ones so let's copy paste this we'll go over into the notepad put it there okay let's get straight into it so here is the first game and uh this is the city view so wow interesting we've got a whole bunch of white buildings here this definitely feels like europe but first i kind of felt like south africa or something based on how dry it looks um but yeah the white building should be european so let's take a look here we've got stubby antenna which is interesting so perhaps even south america here which is um curious because i thought with all these white buildings it should be europe anyhow let's take a closer look here at what we've got going on a lot of red roofs it's quite dry we've got some hills in the background oh big mountain over there as well okay we've got some cobblestone which is interesting um so let's just check where the sun is um so sun is more to the south so perhaps northern hemisphere here and i'm starting to lean towards mexico i must say i'm starting to lean towards mexico here so i don't know if mexico city would look like this i think um mexico city would be a bit drier uh just trying to see if there's a long or short number play here but yeah we're definitely in some kind of like valley here you can see there's big mountains on this side big mountains on that side check out this over here we've got a big cross now is that christ the redeemer statue in rio de janeiro i mean the white buildings couldn't fit that but i would say this uh this whole climate is a bit too dry not to mention the fact that the sun is more to the south um so it's just another city where they have a big cross presumably i mean i hope i'm not wrong here so let's see if we can see any other number plates no the number plates are all obscured unfortunately so that is quite annoying but let's get into the map here and see if we can do a good one so presumably somewhere quite dry in a valley so what's this one looking like could we be here to be honest we could be so the city we're looking at is to kind of like to this we're kind of like uh east of us it's kind of like to our south east so we could be somewhere up here in the hills uh and then if we were looking down so do we have anything like a cross or anything like that um not too sure i mean we need a fairly sizable mountain over there to our south and we don't necessarily have that gear unless we are over here even still not really sure how tall these mountains are so perhaps not santiago de que perarato taro so where else could we be here maybe this city here uh this one might look more promising if i'm honest um and we have like bigger mountains to the south so that would certainly fit and over to our north we also have at least some hills so yeah i don't mind this one i must say i don't mind it i'm still kind of worried that this isn't mexico and it's somehow brazil or something i mean i just really hope it's not rio but um i'm pretty sure the climate precludes it from being that but yeah i think i might go for this one um and uh to be honest the climate should fit i think the climate should fit monterrey let's check out monterey before we go here so monterey we do have mountains on every side here do we have a big cross that's why we're looking for like something that's uh so it's directly to our south we're looking for something um that's like marked out on the map as being a particular location uh and i don't necessarily see one um so but i think monterey might be a little bit greener than this as well could be wrong on that could be wrong so let's let's hope it's not one terry i'm gonna go uh with my guess over here in moral moralia because i think the size of the size of the cities are quite right as well because this one does not have like a big central business district so let's go for that we'll see we'll see and oh okay not too bad at least it wasn't brazil or anything so this one was in chat and this was tex tux gutierrez so yeah this was it and what's the name of it i was this is just a church where was the big cross thing um maybe it's not even marked on the map so yeah it would have been a tough find but i hope some of you guys got that because um yeah not too far away not terrible let's see what we've got going on in the next one so this one is interesting we're in trekker so that's good uh this is official coverage i believe yeah so it is trekker um as for the buildings here quite interesting so my first thought here is singapore and i'm pretty sure i have seen this i've never been to singapore but i'm pretty sure i have seen pictures of this big garden at the top here now the question is um could that actually just be in could there be multiple ones that are similar to that um elsewhere we're next to a big bridge we have what appears to be like a church or a castle or something like that but yeah the architecture and climates could certainly say that we are in uh in singapore here so i want to get in the map i'm i'm pretty sure i'm just going to guess here because that that that does appear to be uh where i think we are so the um the river is kind of running north south at this point uh so just trying to think what would that be called that big building i mean i think the size of the river and everything certainly uh means that we could be somewhere along here but i'm not sure what this building would be called but we can probably find the ferris wheel though we could probably find the ferris wheel that will probably be closer around so yeah somewhere north to south checking over here as well i mean all things considered we we look to be in like a botanic gardens as well actually so lakeshore view okay so if we're on lake shore view the closest thing should be the um the ferris wheel here and we should have a bridge over to our north so yeah we definitely don't have that there as for over here um apple bay tower no no no okay let's move on so back over here back over here so here we could be near the flower dome and yeah and here is the um ferrous wheel and then we should have the big um so we should have this bridge to our north which has met multiple lanes on it so i don't think it's that um so perhaps we are like standing right over here next to the bridge so where is the other bridge here i'm i'm kind of confused actually you guys can tell that 5k really isn't my speciality so perhaps okay that might make sense we're actually over here and there's the bridge okay sorry sorry for being stupid but there we go and we were eight meters away good okay well you can tell that my uh 5k skills are kind of rough but uh not to worry we still got a good score here so here we are next to a big white castle which is pretty cool um this guy's darker skinned so thinking maybe caribbean or something like that not too sure yet could be uh brazil as well or something like that uh looking down on the beach here this is what the people look like a lot of red roofs white buildings um a lot of palms and and the the pole is painted white at the bottom so definitely thinking of brazil here definitely think of brazil to be honest uh we're in like a cove like a big cove it's it's a sizeable city but um not the biggest not the biggest that's how many skyscrapers we have and the city is to our south so we got like a cove with the city to ourselves so salvador is possible here i feel like we could be somewhere over here um and looking down at a bigger city there so what if we were over here um that would be a restaurant and a church so perhaps not there this has to be close to the equator as well let's remember that because of how many um just because of how many are logical how much how many palm trees we have so looking to the south here so the land where we are is obviously to our east so i am actually kind of concerned i mean yes that is to our east so if we're looking down here and that would make sense we should see more land over here and we do so i'm actually kind of confident about salvador here the question is um which kind of outcrop are we at so let's try and like trace the coast along so we should be right next to a beach that's true okay hey i was looking over here so do we see anything further over here yeah that should be the restaurant there and we're actually going to be here i think with a hexagon layout enduring fort with a hexagon layer i think that probably does that describe this it's kind of hard to tell we can only see one side of it um could it be a hexagon certainly could be there's nothing saying it couldn't be i don't think and we have the beach here following along and then the city should be coming along and then we should have city right there so yeah i think we're right i think we are right and then we have ocean and then the land here so we are correct here guys let's go another 22 meters so this has been fairly successful so far hopefully you guys are also getting these um but yeah it's definitely fun without a time limit just to take my time and work it out but uh here's the next one we have a bit of language but let's take a look at the city first uh take a look at the architecture so we've got we've got a fairly sizable port here that's interesting this appears to be official coverage yeah we got tracker it's a christian country um what else yeah we're next to a church actually you can see the cross there uh so an interesting maybe it's just a house actually it's just a house with a cross door we'll see we'll see but the fact that there's a cross here as well makes me think we may be in a church here um we do have yeah so this is the language encir du recordo so probably spanish or portuguese i would say probably spanish um as for this city uh it looks quite modern quite nice kind of reminds me of like one thing i was thinking at first was like panama or something but not really sure that we'd have trekker in panama i don't think that exists could do i'm not sure anyway we've got so we got ocean over there to our north we've got ocean we've got kind of land to our south and more ocean over to our west so we're kind of looking out at this direction panama city then would potentially work but i think it may be too big not really sure we'd have also mountains in the backdrop here which we kind of do and to be honest the mountains are over there to our east anyway no they're not so yeah i don't think panama city that's just a thought i had so if not we'll be over here if that's the kind of area of the world i'm thinking of um this one hasn't got enough of the port i don't think so don't think we're going to be there also it's probably a bit green to be there as well to be fair so this one's actually starting to annoy me a little bit where are we actually going to be i'm really assuming that this one's going to be central south america okay so let's think about um let's think about costa rica so obviously san jose won't work yeah pretty much everywhere else is not coastal enough so okay not costa rica um okay not gonna be in merida um could we be back in mexico could we be back in mexico if i was thinking that given that we have the ocean to the north and to the west would kind of have to be somewhere over here so could we be on this city here it's not enough of a cove so we have like a lot of like island we have a lot of islands and whatnot here so am i completely misreading this could this be in europe still hmm i don't i don't really think so so okay let's head back over to brazil then um it's got to be very green okay sao luis this one could be more promising to be honest so we'd have like so this central city should have a little bit of like kind of island stuff to the north of it that kind of fits i feel like that fits so if we were over here let's see and then we'd have more land over here with some islands we do have islands but i don't think the islands are enough because if we look directly south hmm so if we were here if we look directly south we can see kind of the cove coming along here i don't think this is right really i only hope it i really hope i'm not gonna go away from here when it's actually correct but i don't think it's right we should have like rivers running through the city i mean it could be it could be and then we kind of have these hills to the south so we saw some hills here i think i don't know i don't know okay so that's one thought that's one thought um over here doesn't fit we need like quite a few islands and whatnot so maybe it's going to be up there in brazil really could be so looking back at the language not really sure if i can tell the difference between that and spanish okay what about over here augustinos if i had to say this looks more like spanish to me it looks more like spanish than it does like portuguese okay but it's very green so guatemala what is guatemala is there any city in guatemala that could feasibly be this one i don't think there's any city big enough that's belize i don't know if there's any like coastal city big enough here okay especially considering we have the ocean to the north so it would have to be over here uh and that one doesn't quite fit we don't have enough islands nor is it developed enough so yeah this one's kind of stumping me i think i'll just guess in a minute here um dominican republic doesn't really look like it no no no it can't be there uh so yeah i think i will go over here in san luis obis sorry and um hope for the best probably not going to be somewhere over here i hope not porto alegre it's quite green but uh yeah there's not enough ocean there so yeah pretty much uh going to be committed to this guest now let us find out if i'm correct or not and ah man it was this one i looked here and i didn't look here so i i have no i have no doubt that a lot of you guys got that carter jaina or yeah however you pronounce it but uh yeah i looked here and not here so that is quite disappointing and of course it fits the angle quite nicely as well it's only to be expected but and here we are in the final round of the first seed we do have some yellow plates here feeling like israel surely and so let's check this out okay this is is this like the dome of rock is that's what is that what it's called and i think that's in jerusalem is it not so let's zoom in here um so if we're in jerusalem we're looking down here so we'd be somewhere up here and do we see the dome of rock is that what it's called i'm scared that i'm wrong my uh my general knowledge is always being put to the test with things like this um but just trying to find where it will be so if we're looking at the city here it's like in in front to the okay so we actually okay scrap everything i just said we're actually looking down to the city uh from this direction here and so um we have the garden of gethsemane and then um should have what else well what else is going on here so we should have the wall is this the wonky arrow um trying to think just trying to think here so we have the wall and then we have like a den an indent and then we're over here at some maybe governmental buildings or something like that so yeah i do think we're gonna be somewhere over here but i'm just struggling to find here's the zion gate so perhaps this is the wall running along here next to those highways i'm pretty sure this is jerusalem i can't think of anywhere else that would have this kind of um kind of skyline or if you if you even want to call it that's not much of a skyline there's not many uh there's not many uh skyscrapers that's for sure um if there's a tour there's a group of tourists here as well so that would definitely fit they look like they might be from africa as well um so yeah that would definitely fit um with jerusalem it would be a place that where most tourists coming to israel would go i imagine and we have the garden here so i mentioned this is the garden of gethsemane there so we could be over here um and we should be next to something official or something like that that's the feeling to get so maybe even up here uh and if we were looking down that would kind of fit there's the western wall but i still haven't found the dome of rock which is why i think it's called at least um but maybe we won't so if we pan over here still not anywhere to be seen unfortunately what's this that's not that um i'm i'm a little a little scared but uh i think i just have to go for it here um and i i imagine this will be correct anyway so let's see you guys will have to tell me what that's actually called and okay so what's a little further in actually actually quite a bit further in so if we look over here not too sure anyhow we got a good score here 4.5 kilometers away no doubt a lot of you guys got a little closer here but yeah we're super close to the wall there and uh this was there's the dome of rock okay good good there it is so that's right uh and there we go 17 900 a good score but not great um we really should have gotten closer on this one over here um but apart from that decent apart from that decent for sure and just a tough mexico as well so let's go for one more uh seed here definitely enjoy myself on this one and uh yeah let's uh let's go over invite friends which is you guys of course and uh yeah let's get straight back in okay so here's the first one we appear to be driving on the right hand side of the road and we have these blue number plates so presumably we are looking at dakar here that's the only thing i can think of and so we have the city over there to the south uh however we could be in another senegalese city especially considering we're looking at the city to the south so i guess we're going to be over here looking down to here in fact that's the only thing it can really be we're right at the ocean here on a highway so that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me we have to be like right here i think is this double land we need a double land road so maybe here the thing is we're so close to the beach so i'm starting to second-guess myself here we're probably going to be actually closer to this direction here i imagine so if we look north we have some buildings the angle of the road is kind of north east i would have imagined so starting to get i don't know my compass skills really need some improvement here that's for sure but okay so let's think here for a second if we were somewhere riding along the coast kind of going north east and we see stuff to the south which is the city presumably which juts all the way out like that so that's definitely that that's the question is whereabouts are we you know the obvious question of geoguessr i guess but yeah i mean do we have a beach here or anything seems like we are right next to a beach just before it curls around the first time so uh where is a beach here surely they're normally marked quite nicely on the map um and i don't see any particularly like yeah interestingly there don't seem to be any here okay so what if we were here i think that's too far away we're kind of in line but kind of in line with the city so i do think where we've gone here is probably the most the most um the one that makes the most sense uh that's what i'm trying to say so i guess it opens up into two lanes here yeah and it bends around to our north it bends around um that way so i don't know maybe it's over here instead i don't know i think that's what i'm gonna guess somewhere along this road here and uh yeah we're gonna just gonna have to hope for it it kind of bends both sides uh it's annoying me it bends both sides okay we're gonna go here this is i think the correct one what's up and oh my gosh dude that's embarrassing i don't want to post that but yeah i was completely misreading the um the compass there i mean of course the uh ocean is at least like facing the same direction but the road is not going the right direction i don't know what i was thinking or was it okay kind of what's it kind of was i just found a similar looking one and we should have like been directly south i thought the city was directly south but uh no okay well at least we got the right city it's kind of hard to fail that one but i still managed to uh here we are in japan and uh this one is going to be interesting what city is this over here so it feels pretty green uh how many pine trees and stuff do we have big bamboo trees over here um quite a lot of like wooden architecture so it seems to be like more of a temperate warm climate based on the uh fruit bushes over here and we have kind of hills surrounding this city so that's why we have a nice skyline of it now i imagine that is quite common in japan considering all the mountains that we have we'd have hills on all sides of the city uh but at least it's not coastal this one really doesn't look like it's coastal at all so that is good we can look inland for this one um so we could be like here um that one's i i consider a possibility this one also i kind of like that looking down um the city is actually to the south of us or kind of to the south um east there i imagine yeah the southeast so if we were looking down there we'd see big mountains uh to the others towards the other side towards the south this one i don't think fits because we kind of have the mountains like cutting through the city almost oh like in the center because we have more suburbs out there and this one it doesn't appear to be the same so maybe a little further north here so in terms of the bigger towns through here it's hard to know like this is like a massive urban area actually stretches a good hundred kilometers there or something uh but yeah as you can tell i'm just kind of trying to talk while i'm figured while i figure this out i'm not really sure where this is gonna be it should be a bigger city but um it's not really coming to me so could we be in this place here kind of looks possible the mountains would have to be bigger so i don't think we're going to be there um this one this one's possible as well actually looking at it we have mountains all sides we do have kind of the mountains cutting in through the town so we can see it both sides potentially like this um mountain range here so could we be there or something like this could we be over here kind of looking through less keen on it still less keen on it than something down here um so this city here was i looking at that before i think it's a bit small so in terms of the like skyscrapers and stuff there might be like one or two there's definitely a lot of big buildings though so it's a significant city but i'm just not sure where to go here just not sure where to go so um i have to make a guest soon right but uh maybe i will go down here it just it has that kind of climate look about it i think i think i think it does so i do want to guess somewhere down here ah the question is where yeah i think i will go for this city here i really don't know i don't think there's like enough uh mountain cutting through it uh or even hills um but uh yeah i i also just i have no idea as well so i guess it will have to do this one also too small so let's go on the south like i said and okay wow it was on kunamoto and there's the hills cutting through it so i was right about the climate wrong about the city um and i was also wrong about the fact that i thought it wasn't going to be inside that we could i also thought that we wouldn't be able to see the ocean but check it out like these mountains here were obscuring our view of the ocean completely so the orc we could see was this and here was the hill cutting off this suburb these suburbs which we were looking at to the south so they haven't a big city for sure kunamoto and a tough round but all things considered yeah this city was too small but uh yeah a good guess a good guess not a great one next one okay this one looks looks this one looks very achievable i like the look of it so before i look around surely this is south america um mexico or brazil i would probably lean mexico here uh seems like the sun will be to the south seems like the sun is well actually no it's not it's kind of midday so we'll disregard the sun for now the single yellow line says mexico not brazil i don't think they pretty much ever use the single yellow line in brazil so mexico is going to be it's a big city it it kind of reminds me of like a lesotho mountains here but obviously you're nowhere near that you'd never find a city this big nor this colorful in the sutu um this poll is interesting but yeah check it out we've got so we we are kind of we are kind of in the north uh west of the city here and the central district seems to be way down to our yeah way down to our south east uh southwest there so so we're gonna be on the northwest of a big city here um it's very green so let's check out this one this was this is where we were last time and um i i i don't think so i think it looks it looked a bit different didn't it was a bit drier but we could be in a similar area so thinking about merida here probably too flat out in yucatan probably too flat um so moving closer now to mexico city okay so this one is also going to be too flat i believe i mean we have big mountains to the west we always we have to remember that for this round big mountains to the west um and to the north so if you look in here the only place we could be here was it was right here um puebla it's possible i'll leave my marker there i do think we could be right next to this big mountain but even still we would have more no we'd have more mountains so i i i i i don't think puebla a mexico city however could that be possible could be in text cockle here um possible as well honestly if we were like over here we're looking at mountains over here you might not be able to see the center of mexico city but we might just be looking at kind of one of the northern districts or something like that if we were over here say we were over here or here still not confident about mexico city though so otherwise other ones in the area yeah there's plenty that fit mexico is pretty homogeneous in terms of the fact it's kind of like japan where all of these cities are built near big mountains okay monterey this time would have been a real opportunity if there were mountains in the right location appears like most of the mountains are to the south again so yeah this is pretty much what we're dealing with we don't see any ocean which is good um but again i i ate my words last time so we could easily have ocean to our north and we just can't see it regardless i don't mind um i don't mind guessing somewhere in mexico city puebla aurelia these are these seem to have like a probably the right climate it's probably going to be in this mexico city area which is quite quite a funny looking area in many ways okay this one is nice could we be in cordoba here um it's very like grid system and that would kind of fit with a lot of these hill mountains like these houses on the hills this could be this and we could be over here next to this mountain we'd have mountains to our north we'd also have fairly sizable mountains to our south and the city is probably about the right size so i think cordoba actually is the one i'll go for here um so it could be any of these ones obviously that i've gone over but i i like that the best out of the ones i've seen so far this was actually in pachuca um so this is what the actual structure looked like it was a bit more populated than where i clicked um big mountains to the north and not too much to the south really just kind of vague hills so the place i clicked was two mountains to the south and in hindsight yeah these mountains were big not that i could see the south that well uh but not a bad effort either right side of mexico city and we're back in japan and this is a big city and very very gettable with this big harbour so this big harbour to the south with a big bridge we're in mountains obviously this one in terms of the vegetation and stuff we can't see much we can't see much but a big harbour to the south a big harbour to the south so this one should be gettable so in terms of tokyo it won't be that um unless we were right here we can see this bridge like that but yeah the the mountains would be too close in here and tokyo is too flat so we can rule that out really quickly here same thing with nagoya uh also too flat i believe at least um in the city part um it's possible nego is more at least more possible than tokyo is i don't think we're over there um so okay this one is possible we don't have a bridge though so we needed a bridge we don't have a bridge i'm relatively sure that this structure here is a kind of some kind of big draw and not a drawbridge but a big um what you call it suspension bridge or something like that so don't think that one works but yeah i was thinking more northern anyway so let's go back over here kobe uh probably not um okayama okayama uh probably not as well so just thinking here so okay so back over this direction up to the north can't really see any that i like to look up too much here these cities are too small like this definitely has the appearance of a a reasonably sized city especially looking at that direction we need the mountains on all sides as well okay so harbor to the south harbour to the south so hockey uh hokkaido um i don't think is gonna be it oh hold up look at this this one now has some potential we have the mountains on all sides apart from uh over here but presumably this would be on a mountain itself but the problem is we're kind of looking i mean it is kind of over to the east so um this one i don't mind i must say so let's take a let's take a closer look around we're on like a an s bend somewhere not that one um so if we were if we were right here if we were right here we have to be on quite a hill this is the problem the town itself is quite nicely shaped uh and does the land end after the bridge that's the thing over here the land kind of ends abruptly after the bridge here we can see more hills going on and also obviously like big shipping yards as well in the meantime which i don't think we have here so it's probably going to be a bigger city than that but that one was at least fairly good looking for what we were looking for so i might i might guess there anyway just because i think the search might end up being too long otherwise but yeah i i i don't think we're actually going to be there despite how good it looks initially um so yeah this is this is pretty much turning into too much looking for my liking bit impatient perhaps i am but yeah i don't know i don't see any others that are gonna fit quite as nicely as what we found so i think we will just rip it in and see if uh see if we are correct surely this is not correct surely it's not this one here um the more i look at it the more this could be true but i just think it's too flat i think we'd see tokyo um i think tokyo looks a bit different i think this is a smaller city than tokyo so yeah this is what i'm going to guess i'm going to go guess all the way up here and hope for the best dinner i don't think it quite fits but um yeah i can't think of anything better and okay that's why we're down we're in nagasaki and look at that that is the perfect that is exactly what we're looking for slightly to the east south bridge and of course a very very mountainous part of japan as well you can see these mountains going all the way out here so that is what we were looking for nagasaki and presumably a lot of people will have gotten that because that's a famous city and a famous region as well um but uh not one that i was able to identify unfortunately so as for the final round of the video here we have the new walk past we're gonna be in newark but uh because we already know the city let's try and give it a 5k so we have a big mountain to our north here we're kind of going on an east west bridge here or like kind of a diagonally shaped bridge here uh so here's the walk and we're going across a small bridge so this one shouldn't be too hard so looking over this direction can we see the big mountain interesting maybe maybe we're not there because i do not see what it is we're seeing so in terms of other bridges then well this one would make sense so do we have like a rock wall coming out we do have a rock wall and if we're traveling like this so the yeah we would see the rock wall to our north and it would bend out like this i think this is it i do think this is it and then the the road would bend through here though hmm and we have like shops here okay we do have shops here on some kind of island uh so this and then it goes out for a long time but we can't really see it so we should have some boats here as well um obviously they're not gonna show up but that would make sense and then kind of a rocky hill here yeah and then we have more more land out here presumably this is what we see over there um and then big mountains to our southeast here and that is those so i think we're right here i don't really see anywhere else that we can be um and i'm i'm thinking this is gonna be a 5k to end out the video which is nice which is nice because we were struggling for form in the second seed for sure uh so we're going to end up with a 20k i hope and we were indeed 45 meters away a little bit closer to this side but a perfect 5k to end off the video that was thousand and fifty five hundred and fifty eight so i'll be looking forward to seeing how you guys go um some tough japan ones there so close and yet this one was in winter coverage so it looked a little different um and uh yeah not my most proud seed but at the end of the day you know i'm not the best at fire king and i'm getting there so anyway uh thank you very much for watching like the end much appreciated and yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this city skylines let me know if you wanted me to do more of it and whatnot but yeah i'll see you guys in a video very soon catch you later ", "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/5hGM7EWFZ6BUQkhU", "data/images_zi8gzag/EfRspknUHEP8oPwy"], "locations": [[{"round": 1, "lat": 16.778441148404, "lng": -93.13368125811985},

here welcome back to another geographic video today we're playing an unexplored world which is a really fun map that places you somewhere in a place that does not normally have google coverage and that's good fun because we get to see a whole bunch of countries that are not normally featured on this channel and also the good thing about this map is that it's normally in an urban place or normally near a road so we do get normally some signage to help us out my score from last time was thirteen thousand three nineteen thousand three hundred and uh this time we are going for twenty thousand that is the aim so let's set this to a minute and thirty seconds no moving and i'm gonna put the challenge link inside the description all the challenges will be there so you can play them before you see the video okay and now let's get it okay so first one how are we looking uh we're in the middle of a road red number plates i seem to remember remember red number plates somewhere in the middle east and so looking around at the landscape that would probably fit as well uh so okay it says muscat so that is the capital of oman hopefully when you guys were playing before this you guys realized that but yeah so we should be somewhere in muscat and actually i probably would have gotten this anyway um because i did remember that oman is the country with the red number plates also apparently quite a few yellow ones as well anyway so we've got like a big monument to our north here and i'm pretty sure normally uh ministry of labor interesting normally the compass is correct on these so could we be looking up that mosque probably not just trying to look to see if there's any like big palace that's to the north what about this like lake park could be something like that i don't know it doesn't really appear to be showing itself to me so maybe a row like that could fit let's see how close we are in muscat and actually 11 kilometers over that's why and so i don't think the compass was quite correct on this one but regardless we're not too far away so that is a really good start to this seed next one okay this time we're up in the mountains oh we've got like a rift in this guy interestingly but yeah it looks like we're driving right hand side of the road and what does it say on this registration seems to say nothing we're driving in a mercedes this one almost like reminds me of turkey or something so i'm maybe thinking iran we have a lot of like metal uh power poles as well so that's something you often see in that part of the world uh also kind of reminds me of maybe lebanon as well so i'm kind of feeling like lebanon syria iraq iran somewhere in that area of the world i think make makes most sense uh so how what are the dry parts of lebanon look like maybe maybe we're like kind of further out into the desert over here alternatively i think anywhere in this part of iran would make sense so that's kind of what i'm dealing with here i actually think i prefer iran more um if we're like somewhere in this region here probably or maybe even towards the north coast but yeah i think that's better just because i think it would be a little bit greener in um lebanon just my conjecture we'll see if i'm right or wrong about that and okay this one was in tajikistan 600 points only so not really in contention for that 20k anymore but we're writing to sean bay there so definitely tough round okay next one okay so we're loading in here uh okay so we have a museum here royal museum so immediately i was thinking just because it kind of looks like indonesia or malaysia we could be in brunei here um so that's my first thought but let's take a look here looks like we're driving left-hand side of the road do we have any flags anywhere that's what i kind of want to see if we have the yellow the iconic yellow flag with the hands on it seems like it's a type of place where you take off your shoes before you come in we do have some arabic but i think you'll agree it doesn't really look like the arab world here with with this much green okay here's the here's the brunei logo so yes we know we're in brunei and i would say capital city um would make most sense here so let's go there and we are 2.9 kilometers away very clean indeed so man if only round two had been better but that's okay this one is interesting we've got some yellow number plates here driving left-hand side of the road so immediately thinking something in the caribbean we got a church here definitely like old style so quite colonial perhaps um probably feels yeah probably feels more like um over here than somewhere in africa to me uh even though a lot of the people seem to be like have african um heritage uh so we've got mountains here yellow rear plates one of the front plates okay the front plates are white so definitely oh a bit of french though i don't know yeah yeah so a bit of french so why would we be driving left with a bit of french so immediately i was thinking um jamaica i'm thinking bahamas stuff would you get any french like that in bahamas no i don't i think bahamas has different number plates anyway now i've got to think harder here british virgin islands probably not some kids and nevis hmm it's one of it's something in here some kids are nervous maybe hmm yeah it seems like there's there might be a little more french um like kind of kind of influence here i'm just trying to think like we got mountains in the background though okay so at least since kits and nervous makes probably more sense than jamaica so i'll just go for that but perhaps there's some clue that you guys could work out here for getting it but it seems like there's a bit of french here so we shall see i guess let's try some kits and zero points oh mauritius i always forget that mauritius left-hand drive um assuming it was unless that was just a the kind of road that goes and and we were actually right hand drive but hmm actually kind of hard to tell if we are driving both hands both sides of the road there i think we were left-hand drive and it just happens that mauritius though being originally french drives left so a tough round in every respect there zero points should have gotten it but i really thought it was caribbean regardless here's the next one uh okay so this one should just be lichtenstein it definitely looks like austria we've got german language as well so yeah i don't really see this being anywhere else um considering that lichtenstein does not have normal google coverage it would definitely make sense that we're in vaduz or something like that and um there's a guy in my comments is his name timos or something like that um but he's always asking for lift and stand rounds well here we have one and i think i'm gonna go get it correct so let's just look at see if there's any proper clues here i mean we're kind of going north to south maybe on like one of the main roads here i would assume so yeah so that would make sense we're probably like somewhere along this road here i would imagine does it bend along okay it bends along the other way so maybe we're like over here instead huh do we i don't know if we had a roundabout okay there's a little further this way uh regardless we get a nice score 3.2 kilometers away just outside the capitol or perhaps still yeah probably still in the capital but the capital is kind of more long than it is wired so we end up with 15 500 do tell me if you beat me or if you failed it's like kind of three easy rounds and two hard rounds i imagine some of you managed to get the 20k but for me not this time so let's play again get another challenge link inside uh the little uh text document here and go for it okay so next one looking okay we got a yellow sign here par a so south american feeling uh interesting okay so paraguay is my first thought here it is quite tropical though so perhaps actually um venezuela would be more likely it seems like we are speaking spanish rather than you know what will be speaking english here or maybe even dutch and staring arm or french and french guyana um instead here it appears that we're probably speaking spanish and yeah so i think for that reason venezuela would make sense i do feel like i've seen a venezuela round with a yellow pole as well but let's take a look over here that's not a flag i kind of hope that would be a flag it's very low quality yep so i think i do prefer venezuela the most here so i think i'm just going to pick a town that's not too mountainous because it seems pretty flat where we are okay there are some mountains to the north so maybe not at this the same size as you'd see in valencia or caracas but maybe maybe just something like a bit smaller over here hmm i don't know i don't really see any towns that nicely fit seems like it's quite sparsely populated apart from these ones okay this one at least uh has more potential to it i think that the mountains here are a little smaller so i'm going to go in this town here let's see if that nets has a good result oh cuba so cuba um uses pare instead of alto because in central america they say alto so i should have remembered that i feel like i've maybe even had that round before but 1200 is not not the start we wanted okay so next up we've got lion i've had this round before i remember it but now i gotta remember where it was we're in africa somewhere um okay got an asian guy as well um like kind of west african looking i remember this round it was like sierra leone or something i feel like did it say on this sign i feel like it may have karange um he has plenty there's plenty of stuff here i just can't make it out i bet that word right there is really helpful but yeah okay so we've got hills we've got like red soil uh fairly like temperate looking climate so i think it could be anywhere from like rwanda or burundi all the way over to like burkina faso or ivory coast or something like that but it was english wasn't it yeah so oh it says tanzania there okay so i wasn't thinking tanzania but luckily i've seen that so i have a feeling it was like down here or over here or something it was like far away from where i clicked as far as i remember so i mean if it's quite green it would maybe make more sense to be like near the mozambique border but with mountains as well maybe over here let's just go for that okay it was northern i knew it was somewhere out in the far reaches of tanzania uh that was that that makes more sense it was kind of like steamy or like you know those ones get quite like rainforesty so anyway this seed is not looking too good so far we've got a holy pole here maybe french style pole we're driving right hand side of the road um oh that's not well yeah luckily it doesn't have the actual country written there um so yeah unfortunately this language is not really readable super blurry photo yellow plates on the front here but that doesn't really help me too much um because i can't remember which ones use yellow uh but yeah palms fairly green so i remember places on the kenyan border of somalia looking similar to this but i think it's more likely that we're over in west africa uh seems pretty built up um i would say just something like malay or something like that would probably be um a nice guess maybe bamako here um because it kind of feels like a bit deserty but quite green as well so i think i like that burkina faso probably also an option here maybe even niger but let's go for this and okay so this was togo near lume or in lome so another one in africa that's really given me trouble so far three for three uh i i'm pretty sure i remember this one being in um yeah this is belarus we've got a belarusian flag here and i remember in the last episode that they were all on the south so i was like pinsk and brest and like all these towns over here so i'll probably go south because i'm pretty sure it was there um so yeah we can just go quickly on that one if you guys watch my last episode i'm going to click in a region that doesn't have my much coverage so probably central america or west africa or maybe southeast asia or central asia i'll probably go central america here just because there's so many small countries that are missed so let's see about that and okay it doesn't pay off this was in papua new guinea in port moresby so we end up with 9 000 for the second one now for the third one i'm going to go for the 20k so we're going to we're going to keep going until we get a good start here so let's get the third link and uh hope for the best here so this is the third link unless it goes pear shaped in which case i'll replace it so here we go okay so first round here okay we've got like a yellow curb uh steering wheel on the left hand side so driving right hand side of the road white number plates darcia okay this one's definitely an interesting round uh what's this on the shield okay what a lot of asian cars i'm noticing quite a few asian cars here but to be fair quite a few european ones as well we've got arabic here okay that's not exactly what i expected to see maybe northern africa maybe um maybe morocco or maybe algeria i think algae is or robot or something like that so maybe algae is just because i think that would get a little greener perhaps um otherwise yeah i don't really see it being egypt um libya is also a possibility but yeah and obviously we already have tunisia on street views i really think it's between morocco and algae is here algeria so yeah do we see any french or anything that would probably help us narrow it down that's unfortunately too hard to read so let's see if this is good enough and okay it was morocco so yeah that's not gonna that's not that's casablanca as well that's not gonna get us the score we want so we're gonna restart here again no problem at all let's just hope we get a more forgiving round one now okay so let's see what that round is this one left hand drive okay it's india so this could be good uh gj so i feel like they often have area codes on their number plates um some language here can't remember my indian languages yet so probably gonna have to let that go um but yeah definitely india should definitely be india i don't really see this being pakistan um yeah also based on how people are dressed i mean this woman has a head scarf so i mean i guess it's possible but yeah to me it definitely just looks more indian also language i think would be indian rather than oh what's the language of pakistan again i forget i do know what but i forget um anyway it's fairly dry i'm thinking just somewhere in northern india kind of reminds me more of northern india i guess not that i'm particularly would know that well but um let's just pick any like kind of mid-sized city here bunda uh i like that let's see let's see and okay 800 kilometers away again 2000 points it's not going to be the start we need so i'm going to go for one more here uh unless this one's a complete fail we will keep it um but yeah let's see okay so first round here loading in we do have okay we have language here this is good okay so like georgian or armenia it says university of georgia so presumably we are in georgia and i i assume everyone will get this as well because uh that is a pretty big sign everyone's gonna be reading it so yeah but this was definitely like gonna be georgian or armenian anyway and there's like even the soviet-style crossing sign so yep let's go into georgia here i think just capital city would probably make sense this is definitely built up so it's definitely over there or maybe about batumi uh it could be that or that oh so let's see where we see mountains here because if we were if we were in tibilisi um then we would see mountains probably big to our north so yeah so if we look to our north here unfortunately completely obscured by these trees to be honest so not only too much to go off of there having said that we don't really see anything to the north so i could go for the gamble here and go here instead and batumi instead uh something something supermarket yeah i i don't think there's too much to go for f unless it's gonna be code here bb 1a no it does not seem like they have region codes at all so yeah i think i will actually go um batumi here but i'll be annoyed if it's that table easy and okay it wants to please see so we get 3700 it's good enough to continue but not a fantastic score our next one montessori class okay back in india perhaps this time uh we got like a castro is that i think it's a castro little sticker here um so these guys are dressed more muslim like i would say though they have like kind of like the kind of longer gowns so perhaps we are in an islamic country here perhaps pakistan instead of india could still be india we have quite a lot of english around the spot so yeah it should be one of the two i think um [Music] i mean i think this probably has location on it but i can't quite read it okay so if you know your phone numbers i'm sure it'll be easy this one so this language i think it's a bit of a i don't know but it looks more like the kind of script that you'd see inside pakistan maybe so starting to lean towards park here um yeah but with the whole overall lack of clues i think i think it probably is the better option uh so probably like in this valley here running along this river we're gonna be somewhere around there the question is are we closer to the mountains or i think a central hedge here would probably do as well so let's go for that okay so yeah hyderabad we end up with 2500 so we're still technically in contention if we get three perfect scores here but kind of looking like it won't happen hey enjoy a world of abroad we have all yellow number plates here completely yellow um africa so maybe zambia for driving left i feel like zambia or zimbabwe useful yellow so maybe maybe zimbabwe is more likely here kind of feels a bit greener um yeah i mean actually i know that they're probably pretty pretty similar in terms of greenness but yeah definitely these like kind of remind me of british signs so i guess zimbabwe would make sense on account of that as well so i'm just trying to look for a sign that says harare or something um which i don't see just yet but i'm still fairly confident we have like kind of smallish hills to the south are not too sure about whether that works for harare as for lusaka kind of the same deal so okay that's not really going to be a deal maker or breaker uh as for the rest of these signs they're really too blurry to quite read i wish some of these photospheres in third world countries were a little bit high quality but you know that's that's fine um yeah so definitely somewhere in africa but that's about all we can say for this one left-hand drive so yeah it's going to be zimbabwe zambia or mozambique i could only imagine possibly malawi but yeah i like i like uh zimbabwe best here so let's see yeah 3.4 kilometers away very nice indeed okay that's a bit of redemption there a little bit of redemption at least and we have oh flags here so venezuela probably ah okay so right hand drive feeling definitely central america we've got big mountains over there so i like that a lot those mountains are kind of north or more more to the west so more to the east sorry so where could we have big mountains to the east here maybe we're in this kind of central like area of caracas we would kind of see these mountains over to the east where it kind of just ends and the mountains start i mean caracas is amazing how how the mountains just kind of start unless this is all on mountain too i assume it somewhat is but it's really in like a valley um but yeah this this should be the venezuelan flag in the background i could only imagine and with this kind of infrastructure i can imagine not only really being again caracas valencia let's go caracas though i think i like that best let's actually think here for a second valencia could make more sense actually if we were right here we'd see mountains kind of all sides of us which we kind of do okay valencia's looking more and more correct the more i look at it to be honest okay i like valencia better also that's kind of a good hedge um in case it is or whatever i don't know let's go uh valencia ends up being caracas man i've failed all these 5050s i'll say where those mountains i don't know okay these were the mountains it was to the east right so i clicked myself where mountains are to the east like here but over here i guess we were just kind of looking at these ones over here or something like that rather unfortunate we're still on for a good score in fact it's still possible just we just need a perfect score which it does not look like we're gonna be able to get unless we can read this okay we've got like a i feel like we've got the outline of a country and my initial thought was mauritania and i think that is mauritania you know i think like that is the right shape okay so now we've got to think here m-i-n so i'm wondering if that's going to be like a it looks like it says m-i-h or m-i-n so i'm looking in case that's like an area code for one of these towns i remember having a round over here on this peninsula in the last one but yeah okay so let's take a look at again we have like kind of hills yeah we definitely actually have pretty big mountains here so let's get in here i remember there being some inland just trying to see if it's like over here okay please reveal yourself mountains over here okay we have big mountains over here so could we be here oh this is exciting it actually might be over here maybe in this mountain pass over here okay so it kind of continues on for quite a while yeah okay it definitely continues quite a while but i feel like this road makes sense for now okay so we're looking for more we have mountains here as well okay so this one i actually want to click on this road instead just because i don't feel like it is the center of the desert it's probably more close to civilization here um as for other parts okay i've not seen any other mountains just just so far so feeling good about my guess you'll see oh man oh that is tragic so i think i had mine clicked here we would have made it guys we would have made it and yet we get 90 300 again i think i've just like have i narrowly beaten it i mean we're always in the right spot this time let's see have i narrowly beaten my high school here 19 19356 yeah narrowly oh my goodness and then the same time too that's so sad man okay well looks like we have to do another unexplored at some point guys let me know if you enjoyed this video i think it was good fun to record and uh definitely had some interesting rounds in there guys until next time thank you very much for watching to the end like and subscribe yeah bye ", "image_not_available": [2], "images_path":

a map that includes all the countries that are not normally included on Geo guys this makes it a lot of fun to make guesses on because I can't use the normal Google car meta and that kind of thing I have to rely on a lot of real-life geographical knowledge for this so let's let's get straight into it and this one's gonna be a playable so hit the link in the description to see how you measure up against me if you so wish let's get into it all right first round here we appear to be in Asia somewhere I feel like we've had this one on the series at some point we've got these yellow rear plates tie looking language surely this is somewhere in Laos it really does feel that way I think with a language like this that would probably be the only country that really fits here at all I think the uh the language in Myanmar looks quite a bit different with all these uh pearls and circular shapes so should be somewhere in Laos and there has to be somewhere where there where there's no Google coverage because of the way this map works and so I'm thinking of just going somewhere out here or something like that let's try it ends up being 165 kilometers away we'll take that very very nice start indeed okay next one here okay this is interesting I believe this is a Cyprus Bollard and that is also supported by the fact that we're driving on the left-hand side of the road here yeah this is a cyber Spotlight because it looks like a Turkish one but much thicker and so we also have like the big wooden poles which you often see in Greece so that is a that's another reason that we might be in in Cyprus here and yeah when it's a dry climate driving left-hand side of the road in the northern hemisphere pretty much has to be in Cyprus no other countries really work so let's just go over here and hope for the best and something in decent gas on the other side of the island but still are definitely solid okay next one here we are loading into what seems to be perhaps a Central American location actually we have some we have some French here Papa bonhua internet interesting indeed okay we got a uh something Grande instant interesting so okay so is this Africa or is this some Island out in the Pacific I would say it's Africa I would say it's Africa certainly the people look African interesting interesting and a blue and white curb is also quite unique as well you wouldn't see that too often around the place um yeah okay so it's definitely French speaking it's definitely almost certainly in Africa and we have a place name here lava which we'll find out I guess soon enough if that actually is the place name but this uh why am I zooming into America this over here uh this roof looks very Nigerian so I do Wonder for a country close to Nigeria here um perhaps Togo could be a good fit I believe Togo is French speaking at least um at least Benin would be as well so I think either of those two could be a good fit here might feel a bit more tropical so maybe further down the south of the country but it certainly kind of has a similar feel to the two countries I mentioned so I think I'll probably just go for that we got yeah yeah let's give that a go and so it ends up being actually in Democratic Republic of Congo all the way in the South doesn't seem like that place name I had was actually accurate at all uh or at least was a place name at all but okay we we do we do struggle on that third round there okay next one here we are at night time I feel like I've had this round before as well but whereabouts is a good question it seems to be somewhere in the Arabian Peninsula I would say it feels quite wealthy um we've got short number plates as well I think that's also good tell yeah it feels quite wealthy and quite clean as well and um the walls around all the houses definitely do remind me of UAE of course we can't be you and you at least I don't think so um because that normally has Google coverage so I'm thinking guitar I'm thinking of Bahrain I'm thinking of Kuwait I might try guitar here though guitar does does like seem appealing to me just because of how much it reminds me of the UAE so I think I'll go for that let's try it ends up being in Bahrain or actually in Saudi Arabia why do the two countries split is it right here yeah so it'll be right there so that actually was Saudi Arabia but nothing's considered quite close um and it was a good read for me as well I would say okay the final one here should just be somewhere in yeah this is an easy uh Vietnam based on a language Vietnam is one of the most you know unique looking languages just just from just from a glance you can tell that you're in Vietnam and the good thing about Vietnam is often the place uh the the shops have the place name on them so let's see if we can see that um and so we should be somewhere in fun Fiat um which I'm I'm not sure what that is but um I think with a minute to go we can definitely probably get very close here uh is that it uh fun yep okay we found the place very quickly here and so we're on noi and who tip um let's see if I can find that oh so I imagine imagine that we are actually over here probably but could it just be a similar place name right it does look touristy on the map here with all these hotels so I wonder does this look touristy um it certainly could be certainly could be um can we see that place name anywhere else here is uh is seeming to Sharp a little bit more here so I wonder if that will also show up obviously annoying Nguyen or how do you pronounce it is is very uh it's a very ubiquitous name in Vietnam so it's gonna be maybe tough to find it but I think we probably should just keep it when we had it if it's not there I assume it's going to be somewhere in this kind of region here it might be a small town so it might be impossible to find in these last few seconds so let's see where it actually was when we correct and good we were 19 kilometers away in this part of the town uh that is a good result that is a good result honestly I'll take that good bit of scanning and we came up with an 18 okay obviously a very tough African round in between four easier rounds but we'll take that not bad at all let's move into the second scene shall we all right seat number two here let's see what we've got going on over here this one should be somewhere in France I think it might be French overseas yeah and we have blue on both sides of the plane I think but this pole most of us seem very French to me it's a holy pole with this metal brackets around it oh we've got a French flag even okay so that makes sense and a Brazilian flag so surely we're in French Guyana here this this would only make sense right and so where are we gonna be here does it does have French language as well feeling very good about this gasp whereabouts not really seeing anything that's actually going to help us pinpoint this much I think if we're gonna get a good score it basically has to be on these businesses here and if I was Geo Wizard and I had another half hour to spare and I wanted to get that 25k I certainly could be bothered scanning here but as for me I think I'll probably just take somewhere in KN here and so let's see if we can find in the last little minute like a bark or Domino so we have to be in a fairly downtown on area here we have what's this one shares Julieta yeah okay so we can definitely uh give that a go a central hotel we even have a uh looks like a like a like a bit of a Vietnamese there is it no it's probably not but it's an interesting looking one though it's probably a bit further out of town it doesn't feel particularly built up chess I guess uh I guess that's a similar sounding place but ends up just being over here and it would have been hard to find I think because uh it was not properly marked that Domino place was it no well it was actually okay so we get 2.9 kilometers away I'm not sure why I'm complaining about that's pretty uh pretty good indeed especially a nice way to start the seed especially if we want to go for a high score okay so the next one here feels like Central America maybe could even see like Venezuela or Caribbean or something like that um we have two African looking people on the real estate sign there plates are short like you'd see in Central America I would say uh a blue plate there okay this one should be somewhere in the Bahamas then blue plates and yellow planes are often in the Bahamas so we could probably see more of them here that's a reddish play okay I still think that's good for the Bahamas I think they just use a lot of different colors over there and uh we are near Kingston and Black River and so Kingston oh we um perhaps actually in Jamaica here Kingston there let's see if we can see a Black River or a Negril or a what else okay this is a bit scary there's another Kingston in um in Barbados right no that's Bridgetown or West Kingston West the second Kingston we gotta go fast here and Vincent and the Grenadines Kingston and what else what else Black River oh no I'm very worried about this I don't see the other places I think we're basically committed though it doesn't feel quite right does it oh no this is wrong this is wrong that was Jamaica Negril comes up immediately on the map as I see it why did that I probably look straight at it didn't I I should have just switched back I should have been a bit faster there that's unfortunate indeed oh man why do they have to have two places called Kingston I will never know and also I think I've like watched a few videos in Jamaica and everything never seen those plates so feeling a bit unlucky about that okay this one should be in somewhere in Burkina Faso right with the BF can't imagine another country would get the uh BF um domain before Burkina faster did so probably just in the capital somewhere here is the beginner faster uh capital on the uh On the Border somewhere here no it's actually just over here that makes sense I think we're there because it feels very dry definitely feels right can we find uh this place I wonder yeah maybe not maybe not it's not maybe like this feels too generic I think it says ca but again that might be too hard to find and I'm not even sure if it even is the ca so I think I'll just guess Central and sitting here and we'll see and it ends up being 600 meters away that's probably the best outcome that could have happened there to be honest okay next one yeah oh man we could have been on such a good score right now instead we are not um we appear to be somewhere in we're driving right with yellow number plates on the rear this almost feels like uh caucuses but not quite maybe and we do have long plates over here yeah so Central Asia or caucuses surely but it's a lot of Palms so it does feel quite warm um what does that saying something yeah this is interesting this is interesting a bit of Arabic there okay okay but it also feels quiet it feels quite um Mediterranean quite like a mild climate as opposed to a lot of the other places in the Middle East I would say I did wonder about Lebanon here because of the milder looking climate but I guess also like uh things something further over could work as well I think I might try 11 on here honestly just because it kind of reminds me of Australia and a lot of occasions I think I've seen lebanon's that look quite a bit like Australia now the number plates don't ring a bell though so maybe Syria could work just not really sure just not really sure to be honest Iraq even could work here I feel um with that climate but it's going to be one of those ones I think one of the ones that I mentioned is really the correct answer here so let's find out let's find out and it was actually in Algiers Algeria of course makes a lot of sense right latitude rat climate and everything um and yeah obviously like I said in a lot of my videos the Tunis often reminds me of kind of like an Adelaide climate a little bit drier but similar to Adelaide this is exactly the same in Iran I imagine so a little bit annoying there but that's that's the way this map goes sometimes and we have some Spanish here what is this all about then okay it's definitely a green number plate which is strange I think it's Central America look we've got an american guy here American car here do we have any more that looks like it's probably an American car yeah feeling confident with this Spanish plus that should be Central America and dark can we work out the country here 022 domestico yeah should be somewhere it should be somewhere around here Belize seems like a decent option but also feels quite old so maybe not really sure which country would fit that best I mean could it even be Cuba not only sure what these uh with these kind of newer looking cars I think I think often in Cuba you would have kind of old looking cars dominating the streets so yeah feeling good about Central America um please what El Salvador I kind of like Belize I can't lie but no I'm gonna stick with the Hedge and gorilla Salvador here and it ends up being in Venezuela that makes a lot of sense but this was a disastrous seat 11 000 points and especially after we got this score on number one and this score on number three everything else was pretty much as bad as I play so okay let's head for one more seed here probably a bunch of you guys beat me on that one I have to imagine that a bunch of you guys managed to beat me on that one I hope for some rounds with some nice Clues it looks like we might be there like I'm not sure what that's going to be where I'm running some kind of a pattern station here here's the guy who's taken the further got the aviator's on okay feeling pretty cool feeling pretty good about himself I guess like Central America feels decent here South America even possible uh but I like Central America kind of looks like an American number plate you know so honestly I am a little bit worried about Venezuela again here this this number play almost does remind me of the number plate in the last round so I do kind of wonder about that but is that actually worth going for here I'm not so sure oh we've got a yellow painted bottom of the pump here I bet that's a meta somewhere do I actually try it here the sun is to the north so southern hemisphere is solidly here that was what that would be what that suggests but I'm not quite sure I believe that to be honest I mean it would have to be Paraguay then and I don't think this is Paraguay it does not look like a Paraguay to me so maybe uh maybe Venezuela maybe Venezuelans to play here um I'm gonna make the same mistake on it's just gonna be Central America isn't it but screw it I'm going for I'm going for Caracas area here let's try Venezuela shall we and it was actually in Venezuela let's go I wonder how many people have got that right because uh well after the last one it only made sense to try better and we'll correct so do Venezuela plates actually have a little bit of green on them because I think that one had almost almost had a bit of a green tinge again oh we had these plates in the last episode or the one where I was playing against Chicago and it was oh was it Ivory Coast Liberia was it Liberia or no no it wasn't Liberia was it it was one of these East uh West African countries on the coast I'm pretty sure and uh where was it though I like the number plates they're super unique blue with a with a red strip I'm just trying to see if we can see any language here it's so blurry it's actually crazy how blurry this is but Bank of Africa so we have a bit of English there but this poll is like French style so I think it's probably french Africa okay yeah but a bit of French here better French here oh my gosh can I remember it uh Ivory Coast I think it was Ivory Coast maybe yeah that would make sense French French poles and these awesome number plates I feel like that does make sense I think also like it's quite a poor country and this definitely does not feel particularly built up so I'll go for that I'm pretty sure it's correct and it is nice we're we're in this next uh City up that's pretty good okay next one here uh this one should be somewhere in long white number plate there probably somewhere in the Caribbean here yellow rear plates here are varying lengths that is interesting oh that is interesting um hmm what is that all about could it be Fiji here it does uh have white center lines so I I do consider that a possibility but it is rather flat as well at least from what we can see here and I can't remember what the Fijian I'm place look like so probably still leaning Caribbean more here but a little bit worried about that I can't lie I think I should go for Caribbean here but which country some kids never seems like always seems like a good hedge I feel like this is pretty close to the equator so maybe bum no not by bados some Vincent and Grenadines you hardly ever get once there we already tried it once today anything else to say here the white center lines is probably the most interesting part of this round I'm prepared for it to be somewhere in the Pacific Islands honestly they say yellow as well why does it look like it's yellow and then why but I'm gonna try this I'm gonna try this let's see if all right and it was actually in Mauritius Mauritius Strax again Mauritius as far as the hardest country to get on this because it looks so normal like it looks like it doesn't have too much to distinguish at I feel but okay we've got a car pulled over to the left here so immediately wondering about Cyprus oh now someone commented in the last video that often rental vehicles for tourists and tourist areas have red number plates and Cyprus I remember that uh and I'm thinking we go straight for it guys I'm thinking we go straight for it here so let's see we're probably like right here and we're looking at the cliff going all the way out there maybe good luck good work I'm gonna try let's go I mean it was uh the compass was wrong yeah but that is okay and we take a nice points there based off of that good little bit of knowledge that I retained okay last one of the video and we are looking at something in the Middle East here and uh we have a lot of Arabic presumably have long white normal plates here this feels like North Africa to me no I could see it being elsewhere but it kind of felt like North Africa based on you know the poor cable management I feel like I'll be a bit better in the Middle East maybe that's just a bit of prejudice maybe I'm not really sure if that's would actually be a good clue it's hard to say like the breakdown of cars is interesting because we don't have too many European cars quite a lot of Asian ones so that makes me think we're probably more likely to be in Asia than Africa yeah I still could see it going either way really really can I try actually like Afghanistan here you almost never get Afghanistan but I kind of want to try that to be honest oh let's go for Afghanistan and it ends up being in Syria makes a lot of sense makes a lot of sense and we're right near turkey there which is cool oh but we get 11 900 a slight Improvement I think we actually played better on this game but of course whenever you have Mauritius life becomes a lot harder well guys I thank you very much for watching this video hopefully you guys enjoyed the play along and yeah guys I'll see you guys in a video very soon catch you later goodbye ", "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/6U6jNI10vSgM3hQq",

which is a great little map where you are looking down at a city and i'm just gonna try and get the highest score we can on moving so it should be really an interesting challenge i think we'll go about two minutes per round just so i can really think about uh how things are going to go uh in case well in case i need that time so go check out the description now play before you watch the video and then uh you can see how i did and how you did in comparison so it should be interesting here here is the first seed that's what we're looking down on so somewhere in taiwan presumably uh although that kind of looks like a japanese pole marking so i thought this was actually going to be uh chinese turns out it's actually japanese so we're looking at a japanese town down here it feels very green so i am thinking maybe more southern here um just just just because it feels a little more tropical to me but could certainly be wrong about that so yeah i don't actually know any japanese this is not helpful at all to me unfortunately but we do have the ocean here and some kind of a bay to our south so i'm just looking for anything that's kind of decent size that would fit here something like this could certainly work the bay seems a little bit bigger though so even kagoshima could work here i could see that um do we have land all the way to our south it's kind of it's definitely a port town but you can't really see actually too much the the the water is quite south and over two hours east there we do see like kind of a bigger this piece of land so we could be over like that i guess yeah kagoshima it's kind of a risky one maybe maybe something over here would probably make more sense like hiroshima could make more sense really kind of conflicted here hiroshima is probably the safer bet i might actually go for that um because then i guess we'd see like this kind of bigger mountainous stuff over that side it certainly could make sense here i kind of like that um but yeah certainly somewhere in japan also i want to say thank you for 6000 subscribers very much appreciated and it's going super quickly at the moment it's actually kind of mind-blowing but anyway let's go for hiroshima here and man it was kagoshima that's kind of tragic but uh what can you do it's that's always gonna happen sometimes uh but 3.9 k at least i got the vibe that it was sudden next one i'm feeling colombian off the bat here oh we've got like a octagonal pulse it could be mexico too well that looks more like a white number plate but it's kind of hard to tell isn't it so yeah i guess this should be mexico then you do get the octagonal poles sometimes in colombia as well um so i guess let's check the sun as well sun's kind of invisible behind those clouds unfortunately okay so here's what the town looks like it's very sprawling very big i think it does look more mexican in all honesty but the uh the eucalyptus trees are interesting you don't see too many of those in mexico i feel um so yeah i guess i guess so i think it should be mexico maybe further south in in a valley some something like this something like this could certainly make sense yeah i haven't i even quite like that although it's a bigger town than this that's for sure because look this is like quite a significant population living here it could be mexico city in all honesty i don't think so i don't think mexico city would quite look like this it's a very long city that's the problem with this one so a minute left okay this one fits merida would be too uh flat this one though may fit a little better i'm worried that it is actually colombia you know because i should look at these buildings they certainly don't really strike me one way or the other as for the as for the car we've got this short antenna car so yeah yeah really not too much to say on that front unfortunately and the shadows are not being cast in any particular direction so let's look at look at this one chapas um this is um this one's actually kind of the right shape so i i am i'm more amenable to this one the uh the hills are kind of the right shape as well so and then we're kind of looking to the north so it'd be somewhere around here if we were there now i don't really think we see the right kind of roads we'd have to be like yeah would have to be on this one or something it did not really make sense unfortunately so i don't think we're in the right one but if we are in mexico what about this one this one kind of makes more sense i think i'm gonna switch last moment just because i think it makes more sense and it was actually in keto okay so it was a huge city um and it was the capital city of ecuador now the octagonal poles i don't think i've ever seen those in ecuador so i wonder how many people that would trip up to be fair was not a fantastic guess but yeah i didn't really look that mexican um okay so next one here we got some tracker uh interesting old rock here and look down at the city here so we've got like kind of bay to our north east there and then we've got like interesting rock formations i mean rocker rock kind of wolves here um very interesting tracker shape here this is what the trekker shape looks like but it's kind of got jagged edges which is strange but yeah it's a huge town again once again this this should definitely be gettable so where's the sun then sun is more to our south so northern hemisphere that's kind of what i expected to be honest uh but now i'm not too sure no i'm really not too sure maybe one thing that came into mind it's like bordeaux i'm not really sure if water has like this kind of hill in the background because we're not that elevated to be fair and we've got like a bay so yeah bordeaux is certainly not here but what about one light nearby the bay is kind of like over to our north as well so that would be that would make it more southern there so yeah it's actually kind of unclear whether i got to look at these buildings a little closer again huh i got like a football stadium there of some kind spain or spain possible northern spain i don't know i feel like this one's it's very difficult actually romania i'm just gonna think based on the uh like amount of like duplex buildings and stuff i don't know i don't really know what i think here it's definitely a big port it's definitely a big port so i'm sure some people will recognize it based on that um so maybe in the mediterranean would make sense in naples yeah i'm not a huge fan of naples here because we got it we got the uh we got the uh the port to the north which is just very concerning so palmer doesn't definitely doesn't look like that i'm pretty sure um could it be somewhere in corsica but that really makes sense i don't really i don't really think of anything better so i mean that was sardinia but you know corsica or sardinia i can't really think of anything better yeah definitely rolling landscape here it's i don't know was actually in northern ireland that was that was belfast okay so i was thinking british isles but it felt a little too mediterranean to me i don't know was that it was like the uh it was like the the rocker kind of structure that we had in front of us that made me think mediterranean but at the end of the day like um ireland i say british house i'm in ireland um makes more sense okay so that was kind of rough and this one's not so much of a cityscape i guess uh i guess we're probably meant to be on top of here and with glitch down there i think that's probably what's happened i was like we can probably go for a quick guess here i think this is uae uh interesting yellow like bluish uh taxi cab plates here but yeah i'm assuming i'm assuming this is correct in fact i'm sure of it so let's just go dubai here i'm pretty sure we're gonna be near there and ends up being um but we get 20 kilometers away which is good result and the next one looking down on this town so we don't have a particularly good score yet i hope i kind of wish we uh did well on that japan one so i could have redeemed myself more so but regardless here we're driving left so i was kind of uh i was kind of thinking off the bat that we might be in thai one but i think we might be in thailand instead uh because the left hand driving the double yellows so what are we looking down on there maybe phuket could make sense the thick um oh oh this could be in indonesia actually i actually kind of confused it double yellows these bollards would be would make sense for both countries i think this ball i've not come across this one here and these uh these like thick stop signs these thick sign posts would remind me more of thailand and actually these are thai poles so yeah it's going to be thailand so we've got we're kind of in the hills and we're looking down over there to our east at the town so let's get into thailand here so phuket was my first thought i don't actually think it's there to be honest but okay we could be somewhat something like that looking down on phuket if we were up here something like that okay that's possible but an is very green so and it is a big city so yeah phuket could make sense here i kind of like something like chiang mai or one of these ones up here better uh yeah that would make more sense i think if we're on a road like up here or something like that uh chiang mai forest yes certainly could be um yeah i think so other because it is a big city let's take a look at my back of the city it is a vast city and we do have hills on the other side as well so i mean either city technically fits that description because i think there are some hills over here or at least somewhat but i think chiang mai is the better shout otherwise there's some other bigger ones over here this one here is also decent size but kind of flat so yeah i think chiang mai and then we're kind of going directly north to south on this part of the road so something like that or something like that how much we bending yeah i mean we don't really have time to figure it out but that that seems okay and wow the amount of times we've clicked away from the right location but at least we were 400 meters away there so that is a good result went up with uh 15 000 so yeah you could say that that was a relative success just two bad guesses the ireland one i forgive myself for the mexican or the uh ecuadorian one i should have done a better job on but oh let's head in for another seat here uh should be a fun one uh and that's actually my best ever score on the map surprisingly so um let's get this second link going then alrighty so guys hopefully you guys did better on the second one than the first one um but who knows maybe maybe nailed the first one anyway this one does feel mexican now um so we got short front plates and doesn't really feel too american i mean this is kind of an american americana car but i feel like not too many people would drive cars like this to be fair could be us it could be like a tucson or i don't really know one of those i like i don't know if it's feeling yeah so it could be like albuquerque or tucson or something like that i can see that so we have big hills to our east from where we are so that would make sense for tucson and we also have hills over here so i actually think tucson is quite a good fit here although i would i'd expect the twosome would have some more high-rise buildings whereas here we don't have like the biggest to be fair we don't really have the biggest uh like thing we have a massive highway running over here and that would i expect kind of fit with that which looks like the main interstate that runs through here so that and it bends off like that as well i can see it like bending off in a similar direction so i actually do kind of like it hills to the north also are satisfied by these ones here so i think tucson i've basically picked it straight off the bat i'm just surprised that it doesn't have more high-rise buildings so i could be could be uh doing poorly here so do we have like a train station running along here as well trains seem to run on the other side of the road but i do see trains here so seems like the wrong side though so i would have expected the trains to be on this side i mean yeah not they don't seem to be so that is rather concerning i would say why they're not there so maybe i do have the wrong one i'm sure there are other ones that would fit here so phoenix also fits but phoenix is even bigger than tucson so maybe something like albuquerque so albuquerque does also fit i think but don't like it as much we don't have to really the right shape so it could be sound i don't really know but let's just leave it in tucson and hope for the best here 5.4 kilometers away that's a w that's a w and we're actually way closer to the highway than i thought surprisingly so that's interesting but we still get a good guess there very pleased next one looks like a bit of a guinea this this shouldn't be too hard oh interesting black gen 4 car here i've not come across this one where is this okay well sometimes the car medic can't help you too much and that's a good thing uh we've got double yellows here um interesting bike path so maybe like well it's a big city here surely this is gettable uh i think it's san francisco no over these two bridges like this i'm not really sure which one's the golden gate bridge maybe this one over here i think so i mean maybe maybe i'm completely wrong but that is my thought at this stage it's very dry climate to be fair uh so i'm sure we can find this so we're looking north here and we have not too much going on so let's get over here to san fran which is just here so if we're looking north so we would be around here or a little so we see these two bridges that's to our south the one that runs across here so yeah we could be like here and then there's the one then we then we'd have the big city front now we're near the big city front that's the problem i guess this could be the city front here this could be uh these suburbs over here hmm so we could be on an island really i think we kind of have to be like on an island like that so then we hm so i think we're like here and then that and so we have the bridge there and then over to the north we see that bridge yeah i think this is correct and then but we don't really have these hills or do we yeah we do i think that right there is that right there so i think this is correct and alcatraz we should be able to see over here then the alcatraz the famous prison i don't see it though oh there it is that must be alcatraz uh prison i remember it has a watchtower on it so this is correct yeah guys okay i love this map it's just so fun for the um for like the enjoyment of just like uh like getting a great guess you know so this road bends around so we should be a little bit further down here um yeah okay 61 kilometers away we get the 5k beautiful stuff guys i'm actually so stoked about that i guess um okay next one uh okay so we're looking at a gen 4 image here i think this one's going to be malaysia but i'm actually not too sure the road is definitely quite poor quality for malaysia you would think uh interesting is that nindo flag could be um very red so here so i think southern malaysia makes most sense we've got like indo language with also some english as well so indoor malaysian i mean um so yeah one of the two and with the gen four i'm just gonna think the the double whites are the exact reason that i was thinking that it shouldn't be indonesia but maybe you do occasionally see it we got a mosque here but that would fit either country of course still got a minute to go here so we can we can really like take a moment city or city of it's all in reverse so it's kind of hard to read here [Music] or something ends in ar anyway so we can definitely use that to our advantage here and yes i was thinking like could be crossing it from it feels it it's too rural it's too rural just looking for any malaysian flag they like to fly in malaysia and because it's gen 4 it shouldn't be on borneo i'm pretty sure so yeah what is this selling office i think that's a malaysian flag okay so now we look for a a town that ends in ar so it could just be kuala lumpur here we're on like a big river that's kind of running more or less kind of diagonally and it's fairly developed hey uh okay but um this one no i mean it ends with an ar but it's not the right one oh 10 seconds already wow that happened quickly let's just go there i think i see a big river running through there kind of feels relatively rural could be that one i'm not really sure what wow so double white lions in masa makassar and uh that was a tough round that was a tough round so i wonder how many people have gotten that i'm sure there was some good clue if you if you're good at reading things backwards i'm sure that was not too hard but the double whites really confused me there so i should have gotten that that was indo but uh yeah okay well there you go tough round for that one after a nice start uh next one is feeling probably mexican we've got the single yellow line um it's very dry so maybe up further north this time big mountains okay big mountains over to well basically on all sides actually we're in kind of like a in a cradle here of some kind and it's certainly mexico sun to the south so yeah definitely mexico here so now we gotta pick one this one here okay there could be like i wouldn't be surprised if i've zoomed in the right one here because it's a big city and we're surrounded by mountains and it's dry and this one just fits the bill perfectly one would think tijuana is surrounded by mountains but i don't like it as much because we wouldn't have we would we don't really have too many mountains like are we really looking over to the us i don't really think so i think tijuana would be a bit greener as well i could be wrong but i think this one fits better off the bat and then we're kind of up here in more of like a more like this kind of area maybe someone like that could definitely see that so taureon um yeah i kind of like that i kind of like that so yeah here we have those typical mexican um octagonal poles but yeah is there too much more to say here i don't know i feel like i like it the mountains maybe aren't big enough though imagine looking over here they they actually certainly aren't big enough over two hour east there so last minute changes here this one yeah they all have kind of like decent sized mountains maybe tijuana actually does make more sense here because the mountains are certainly sizeable in tijuana okay maybe it is that was not what i was expecting in this one yeah again we don't we don't see the ocean because we we have these mountains blocking our view of the ocean presumably um this one here they all have mountains around them but none of them are big enough so i actually like tijuana surprisingly enough let's see oh man it was this one saltillo so there we go and we were on this one man if i just looked over i would have seen these big mountains and that's exactly what we're looking for unfortunate there not to worry though next one right hand drive usa probably canada oh we got front plates hmm this one's definitely interesting thor okay so yeah front plates definitely interesting so mckinley is that is mckinley in is somewhere in canada i feel like i've heard of a mckinley has a place in canada it's not in vancouver is it not a place called mckinley i think you're probably thinking of langley or something it doesn't really look too much like vancouver to me but just wanted to make sure okay so mckinley doesn't seem to be there okay so then what am i thinking what am i thinking yeah yeah did we fan didn't really remind me of pc okay so mckinley i swear i've heard of that place someone's pulling their hair out who lives in mckinley right now he's mad at me but okay is that what's that price of petrol cause that would make more sense for canada so maybe so do we have any hills or anything i don't know so hamilton i feel like i've heard mckinley but i just don't know okay so i'll check near new york or something i was thinking like new york philadelphia could make sense like that kind of area kinley okay well also like the roads kind of remind me more of texas so i just want to make sure i've got all my bases covered here but this is a big city so who knows where this is bro probably most people watching the video to be honest my us geography is not that good so why do i have my marker now i still have in toronto brian street i'm gonna switch it to philadelphia this could be a bad move but because it doesn't show up there it's kind of this is kind of the area i expected to be in so i guess we'll just find out won't we but yeah with a few seconds to go here it does not look good well yeah i didn't find it so let's see it wasn't dallas so yeah i knew it yeah so dallas was really with those like concrete-ish roads that really was jumping to my mind so what is mckinley actually then so is mckinley a part of the town or is mckinley out of fort worth i remember people talking about yeah fort worth and dallas is pretty much one big metro area here but mckinley i'm not sure about so perhaps that is elsewhere and i'm blind or perhaps it's just part of dallas and that's why i'd heard of it or something for texas but regardless we get the right country but no can do so we had two really good us guesses and then an average mexican average us guess and then that really i was really one i should have gotten though so guys let me see what the time is i have time for one more we'll go a bit quicker this time but let's go for one more playing along link here i hope you guys are enjoying um give give the video a like if you if you made it this far you should give it a video online really shouldn't you um but uh let's let's head into the next scene here and see how we got all right so the next one blue strips or somewhere in europe i like i like this map a lot it's good fun short short antenna on the car kind of a wooden pole interestingly so maybe i'm thinking grease here oh what's that rappel so maybe that's french is that a french for something rappel i feel like that might be french but wooden poles you don't see too often in france to be fair this car here i think is a german car this one is also very interesting indeed but this is not a spanish sign so we can count out spain because spain would not have a white border on the speed sign there okay so then france i think do we have shutters on the windows or anything it's not typical france i will say that much but with the bay to the south it kind of looks like a like a decent-sized southern french town well it's a city it's definitely a city um i guess montplier marseille i think maybe marseille makes more sense here how directly south is the ocean quite directly south actually so the bay is quite directly successful maybe montplier does make more sense here okay i don't think either of them makes sense actually so let's take a look at some smaller ones here toulon makes sense i think nice also makes sense so maybe nice is actually better here nice is definitely a big city but yeah the actual center of the city is quite small so i actually think i like nice quite a lot here we were looking looking down at old niece if we were up here you know and that's pretty much directly south so how does the so it is pretty it's kind of a flat coastline like we see here so i like that and then unfortunately we can't see over here i think if we could see if we had x-ray vision through this house i'm sure we could get a much better view but um yeah as it stands i kind of like that so do we see any pool nearby i don't really know how it would show up on the map actually but probably somewhere up like this so there's there's definitely other places i haven't considered yet but i think we're gonna be near there and 500 meters away i think i clicked away again you know oh my gosh um but yeah that's that's a great that's a great start great nice it was next one yellow plates netherlands i assume the the height of the well no that's a hill so it's not netherlands okay well yellow plates though where will this be if it's not so would we have like a big uh highway crossing like this if we were in luxembourg with the yellow plates or is this just britain oh it's just britain oh stardeon though that's not huh okay all yellow plates what about front plates front plates also yellow i forgot about that so am i missing something here is is this really just a dutch hill right here or no they must have just built this to sustain the uh highway maybe looking at the rest of the round it's still like these are surely these man-made hills cars jeans stadium oh man am i missing something here okay so let's see if we have one of these massive like crossings in luxembourg first so it could be something like that not really sure what i think these blue signs are interesting as well i must say how many french cars do we see i don't know yeah is there any bollards or anything it's just and these look at these uh turning arrows i'm not really these are the chevrons this one's all kinds of interesting the language seems kind of germanic i can't really make out proper words but okay so if it's not luxembourg then it's got to be somewhere in amsterdam surely and do we see a study on here it should be over to our west i don't know man this is definitely difficult i i did not really think this looked okay the houses what about houses quickly do we see any bread brick or something like that it's a big city i think it's too big i think i have to switch amsterdam here and believe that these are actually man-made things here let's go there oh 41 it was the hague wow wow okay so they must be man-made hills i assume well interesting brand indeed okay next one we only that was that was a w i'll tell that's a w at least i didn't go uh in a terrible guess location these plates huh idaho plates i think i think they might be idaho plates you know um if not they're somewhere out here there could be utah plates as well i guess okay so looking down at the city here we are looking at the city is so we got hills over to our east on this city so where was i thinking boise boise could make sense here with the hills to the east kind of then it stretches out and it's flat so yeah boise well we got a big mountain in the far distance so maybe boise doesn't make sense okay idaho falls doesn't make sense not enough hills okay so maybe it's not okay then salt lake city no salt lake city is almost certainly not it because of these hills here oh it could be and we've got hills that run all the way up though okay so i like city at least makes more sense i think what are these idaho plates though i mean were these uh utah plates though i didn't think they were i guess it could be salt lake city so it's not actually a massive city though again i would have expected more in the way of like a big well cbd is actually kind of small the uh the center of the city is actually quite small okay so maybe it is actually going to be salt lake city then the the mountains do kind of curve around like that so that would make sense and then these big mountains in the background i guess we if we were in line with that they would continue continue continue feels like they continue on for too long but it's very misty so it's actually kind of hard to tell so that would be in line with us but then we're looking north i don't love it i don't love it because i feel like the mountains should if in this city they continue on further up there so i guess we just have to hope we're like down here and that's what we're looking at really okay well i guess we're kind of committed to that now okay that makes more sense and these are the mountains we're looking at so two decent guesses about 40 kilometers away in a row uh in a row there so not too bad not too bad next one um gotta start to move quickly here um no antenna interestingly so i think well i think this language kind of looks kind of looks portuguese i don't know actually so this is kind of like a it's it's very very built up but it's not quite a slum that's for sure big highway hills running through the town uh it could just be like a like kind of more like a inland brazilian down here for sure something paz here but it's definitely not the path like i don't think it is the mountains are nowhere near big enough here it's too green as well okay so interesting look at these blue uh like uh what are they like water tanks on the roof very interesting we've got clear satellite dishes so i do like brazil best here okay that's good so then we're just somewhere along the coast yeah what about this one i like that we've got hills on all sides but no mountains these ones well these ones probably would qualify as like decent-sized mountains actually so hmm i'm just gonna pick one because there's just too much in brazil for this to be you know wow circle city it's not going to be that just looking at the climate again definitely feels more northern than southern circle city again drew me in but i don't think it's there what about this one yeah not really loving it this one had the mountains that were too big this one's too small of a town a lot of these are just too small actually and the mountains are too big on that section anyway hmm okay there it was so i probably could have found that with a lot of time but as it stood we didn't really have enough time i i did feel the northern vibe but i just lost track of time as well anyway this one white car this looks like a uh peruvian pole with these three juts out i think and then we've got a bay to our come on east there interestingly but it's kind of like a lake-ish bay so maybe we're here uno would make sense if we've got that bait directly to our east and then it juts out and then it's kind of like a no not quite i think it's titikaka because we see like stuff in the distance here maybe it is puno i i don't know if this little like land bridge here would show up though seems like it might not okay what if we were here i see like a massive like main road running through the town maybe like that which we're kind of in line with and then it ends in hills so it can't be but that's to our south so that road actually runs south i've i'm actually a bit disorientated here so that it's the bay that's to the east [Music] hmm that road run south i mean we were like i don't know i don't think bruno fits but it was definitely my first thought so maybe it's a different light or what why did i assume peru oh yes because of this pole here still peruvian over here [Music] that could at least be hmm it's too small of a town this is quite a big city i'm gonna leave it in puno with 10 seconds to go just because i can't find anything else that fits i'm very very pessimistic about this guess but who knows maybe i've just been completely disoriented 700 meters away okay so we're looking at this and man my perception of scale there was just totally off but we get 22 600 with one poor brazil and then everything else on point guys so good luck beating

dude this is the best guess i've ever gotten in a fan map how's it going everyone it is zigzag here and welcome back to another geoguessr video so today we're playing some fan made maps as usual and this one's brought to you by the channel members and the first two challenge maps for from today are coming from channel members who get to go in the priority queue so uh do subscribe if you are willing to support the channel would be really nice of you also we're having a little league amongst us in our own discord server all the channel members so if you want to be part of that it has not started yet subscribe today and i'll get you in the discord and we can play together so guys today five maps uh the first one here is zigzag challenge map by poker so i say well let's get straight into things here and see how we do okay so first one uh we are in official google coverage here with a a biodiesel truck in front of us and it appears well it's actually kind of hard to see if we're driving right or left-hand side of the road here actually um and so kind of feels like we're probably it kind of feels like north america to me we're on a lake here of some kind and we have this kind of older architecture so that might that might actually um indicate that we're in europe so i wish we could see a number plate here but it is kind of hard to see that one that rear one kind of seems yellow ish and these green signs look more north american so does this pedestrian crossing sign so with it with a somewhat yellow plate i'm thinking of like um i'm thinking of new jersey here i'm just trying to think where it would be maybe philadelphia maybe we could be on the river of philadelphia here and well it doesn't fit but you know somewhere around there um let me just go near philadelphia actually over here uh we would be correct about that number plate okay ends up being just a new york plate actually and this was what rivers is the hudson river actually yes i have heard of that so a decent start to the seat here next one um next one is going to be inside a resort of some kind um got some banana lounges here vanguard for the air conditioning unit or something like that and then was this no swimming blah blah blah blah so i was thinking southeast asia for this but it could easily be elsewhere as well one thing one thing that came to mind is phuket because i know there are a whole lot of resorts around phuket so i guess that's probably possible but you know it really could be anywhere for me um yeah i don't really know where to go go elsewhere um there's no tie on this uh on this sign but i can easily imagine that they just do it in english because everyone coming to a result place like this probably speaks english so let's go for it uh ends up being in dar salaam so there you go that was uh that was gonna be a tough one not really too much to go off of but the architecture didn't really strike me as african all things considered uh this one here interesting like lookout house here over really nice looking beach so immediately felt kind of australian but also like maybe spanish as well i don't know kind of this uh this shrubbery kind of feels like that kind of climate as for me i think i do like somewhere maybe on the new south wales coast here and i just need to find something that's kind of a similar shape so we got the beach on both sides we're looking south here so it could be something like green point and then looking at you know looking at this like thin land border here that yeah i mean like i'm not entirely convinced here but it's possible i do think we're gonna be in kind of an area like this so i might just leave it there but okay that's that's actually a pump drink bottle i can show you one this is this is what they look like actually um i'm pretty sure that is an australian company let me see actually this is external hints but uh yeah i mean i think they're they're australian so i'm using that drink bottle clue to to decide that i am in australia here and probably somewhere around here let's see and uh yeah just just in the northern suburbs of sydney there so palm beach looks like a really nice place actually um but we get we get another good score let's see here we got like a bunch of like lions that are very short this guy here he looks like he almost like uh when he's smoking so he kind of looks russian to me he gives me like a russian vibe something about him uh is that a tank as well this kind of looks like an armored vehicle or something like that i could be wrong maybe maybe that's just my mental associations but i could see this one being russia so the question is then maybe someone out here here or maybe just here um and of the three i kind of want to just go petra pavloskir like area because i'm chugga because i don't know it feels like with high altitude so maybe i will just go over here in the middle of nowhere let's see oh not bad that is actually a really really nice guess and so there we are just in the middle of nowhere as i kind of expected okay next one and final one indeed and this one is a bit more difficult i would say um plenty of like you know this this building kind of feels european to me i must say uh so maybe greenland or norway or costco interesting plenty hilly but also decently dry i can see this one being russia as well you know i think this building kind of feels russian it says hyundai here which is interesting uh it's a obviously korean company but i don't think we're in korea it could be could be in korea i mean the landscape would not be entirely unfitting but it feels more russian to me i must say well i'm going to eat my words if this is green maybe china no i still think i prefer somewhere in the middle of nowhere in russia and so whereabouts will i go maybe like up here i could see it like being up here maybe near norilsk i'm gonna go near the royals clear this one and okay so it was just in the same spot in russia so a bit cheeky there i did that crossed my mind that it could be up there but yeah we end up with 12 000 points so a really nice one i'll put that one as a play along in the description of course okay let's go in here for seed number two which is called zigzag impossible challenge so i i will guess we'll see what what what this impossible challenge involves so interesting we have some latin letters here on this green house here um plenty of palms hilly definitely hilly with these islands so obviously we know from these challenge maps there's many places that this could be this this like bench and house kind of remind me of india so i couldn't help but like feel that could it be on the andaman islands and the man of nicobar islands could is that possible do we have enough like smaller islands if we were over here it is possible i feel like so i don't know maybe it is that's the best the main thing that came to mind otherwise just india or sri lanka um this bench i don't know it definitely reminds me of india maybe i've had this round before or maybe i'm completely wrong and it's just gonna be somewhere in the caribbean or maybe i don't think maldives is this uh is actually this um a mountainous but it's not gonna be there uh ends up being in where is this the phi chook islands well who do they belong to actually uh so should be the uh should be some micronesian islands actually interesting indeed we scored zero points which is interesting because i would have thought at this distance we would have more points than that so maybe all the locations are in uh in oceania that's kind of my uh conjecture from that so this one is extremely low quality feeling asian this time um so uh yeah so it definitely feels east asian a lot of a lot of the buildings feel quite east asian like this one particularly so i am thinking of somewhere out here maybe a southern japanese island or one of these ones just extremely remote what about these ones down here we could go in shima it could be ogashima why not that's kind of what i'm thinking it has like a japanese vibe but also very tropical kind of flat i don't know i'm just gonna go for that let's see ends up being in hawaii there so yeah i was right about the oceania so far so let's let's see if that um theme continues then um okay next one's very dry so this one does not look like oceania and so here we have some fellas they might seem kind of asian looking um i was thinking like so i've definitely seen similar places in turkmenistan so that's one thing that came to mind otherwise i could be like yemen or oman but i like turkmenistan i've definitely seen similar rounds in turkmenistan although it's quite flat so i mean we could be near ashgabat here um so maybe something like that otherwise do you get other hills in turkmenistan it's quite a flat country compared to the surrounding ones yeah so you also get it out here so i will go for turkmenistan could easily see yemen oman pakistan something like that it ends up being in saudi arabia yeah so that was kind of like the other area i thought but we're on an extremely low school here that's for sure oh interesting so let's take a look down at this road so yeah it's also quite poor quality so it's hard to tell what's going on this car looks like i it's tell if it's driving right or left not that it would necessarily make much of a difference because it was just like a like some kind of a uh digger or something like that so i don't know what those are either this is kind of a hard round i must say i must say could it be australia it doesn't really strike me as australia i feel like it could just be asia again middle of nowhere and china maybe in chai maybe maybe just afghanistan or iran or maybe it is australia or south africa i don't really know but yeah i was thinking like rural china could could certainly make sense here in kind of the flatter regions out here so i guess i'll just go for that oh not bad we actually got that it was china although we are in mongolia but we were definitely looking into china there so so not a bad effort then not about effort i'm happy with that and the last one so we have red bricks here um and snow and it says eagle rock resort eagle rock just trying to think if there's anywhere i know in australia but no no this is not australia definitely not so these are our photographers here so maybe it feels kind of european i would say hilly maybe like evil rock resort why would they have it in english like that could it be in britain i mean it could be so stop to think for a second here eagle rock resort i mean the brick building could certainly fit our um our kind of theory about britain here but it doesn't really strike me as particularly british with all these kind of like houses spread out and kind of in the woods so it'll also be quite hilly so maybe uh norway or it could be scotland i don't think you'd see so many trees that's my that's my reservation so maybe like germany or czechia or switzerland well we ran out of time and it was actually in pennsylvania that makes a lot of sense but i just did not not cross my mind that it would actually be the usa there so guys i'll let us head into the next seed then so first one we appear to be somewhere in a city and interesting so can we see what side of the road we're driving on i think it is right hand drive here fairly decent-sized city yeah so it is right-hand drive i believe and uh we have like an interesting coastline some raised rock here which should be somewhat like a distinguished distinguishable i would say um and so if the compass is correct then we've got the ocean to the south here as well um as for the people can't really tell what's going on with them so i think in caribbean for this one was thinking caribbean it's an interesting round that's for sure um minimal i think i know panama has a big uh has a big city skyline like this but panama city is not i don't mind it i must say i don't mind it so we wouldn't have like kind of like outcroppy things we don't have that that is the big concern we don't have like a big jetty thing we do we do have one we ran out of time okay uh so this was when was in torres and uh it's actually not what is a big city but basically everyone lives on the coast there and then it kind of goes on for a long time so really interesting spot there that's for sure 94 points is no good though this is the next round here um this one kind of feels like chilean or new zealand or something like that um more i look at it more i like new zealand i think but let's continue to look here so definitely quite hilly these houses you know i can't actually fully make up my mind where these houses look like they're from could still be either country the fact that they're built into the uh into the like into like the side of the hill here it's very interesting without like a proper road either so that might remind me more of chile because i think you'd probably have like a proper road to these kind of places that's not dirt in new zealand so then sun to the south so northern hemisphere according to the sun but i don't know not much time here what do i actually prefer i still prefer new zealand surprisingly enough maybe i've convinced myself wrongly here but i'm gonna go and have a lock and uh hopefully it's not like over near puerto mont or that kind of region here and of course it is it's right near puerto rico no oh my goodness so there we go this was the actual location a pretty cool spot you must say and yes the exact right latitude dude i can pick it well but it doesn't really help for much does it okay next one here um i kind of on some kind of a beach here short front plates interestingly so maybe i don't know what that means actually um and so some people here could be australia this time could certainly be australia but this kind of industrial zone in the background doesn't really feel too australian though so it well it's kind of a longer play i can't actually quite make out what kind of play this doesn't seem like there's a blue strip on it is what i'm trying to say and so then where to go and these people seem caucasian definitely so nobly strip maybe it is in britain uh that's that's the thing that's come to mind here don't really like have any particularly good reason for going there but um at the moment i have it in workington maybe we can let's go isle of isle of man just for fun here i have no idea where it's gonna be though ends up being in uh in brazil again so yeah no good at all and that's a really interesting location as well so i like that one unfortunately no points to show for it though and so we've had a bit of a south american theme so far so i wonder if it will also be south america here just some rocks i don't really know where to go here um i've seen similar things in argentina so let's continue on the theme here i remember seeing this kind of coast like kind of down here so maybe a little further north oh yeah blanca probably not that far north okay let's go over here yeah so i remember seeing like this kind of you can see like this place has the similar kind of coastline so i'm going to go here and stop being in cape town or near nearby cape town there so yeah i mean that was a really tough friend i don't really think there's much i could do there but i was at least happy with my guess and the final one here maybe feels like canary islands but it's interesting this rock wall we have going on sardinia maybe or greece maybe greece is most likely here with these with the kind of islands in the background but it's gonna be one of the three and again there's not much to go off of here so i'm gonna go in greece somewhere and we are correct okay so finally a good score there and uh had we gone puerto montt which is exactly what i said then we would have gotten you know in the realm of nine thousand but four thousand is still okay considering what what kind of game it was so this one's by adam uh double o three um so let us head into this one now so this one's gonna be the fourth seed of the video and let's go map for zigzag how's it gonna be okay we are on the side of a ship and it is the somethings explorer pacific or atlantic i guess is the question so let me try and make this out then if you're gonna make me ah that's kind of impossible maybe antarctic let's just go antarctic um and i guess most people would like come this direction so let's just go here ah it was the arctic that probably makes more sense okay so when is there i guess i'll remember the yellow boat for next time if i can but uh here's the next round and this one has surprisingly few trees one must say sun's to the south so perhaps northern hemisphere is correct so i remember seeing similar things in like northern mongolia maybe or maybe like southern russia around here so now i'm just looking for anything that seems to like remotely fit so north of ruelan batar did we see any such things okay what about this one here do kind of have like a similar kind of looking pattern to it but it doesn't seem to be the exact right one although getting a 5k here would be just about like picking a needle out of a haystack i feel um okay so i feel like i feel like it could be around here but this is really not an easy round it could be uk as well i i just definitely think i've seen similar things to gay especially with this kind of patchwork farming but i'm going to stick with mongolia it ends up being in uh the azores anyway i think this is zoro's right yeah so it was not really going to be possible there i feel zero points okay we're still on zero points the the day when i got zero points on a seat is yet to come and i i i hope to i hope to um make sure it doesn't come anytime soon so this time we do have sun to the north again so should be southern hemisphere i was thinking namibia for this one i don't know if that's actually rational um the movie is pretty flat and we do have quite a few hills here but i'm sure we can pick a right spot oh yeah we have hills here i'm gonna go for namibia who knows if this is a good guess but kind of feels african to me so why not and zero points again okay this one was actually mongolia so we are in some trouble here let's see what we've got going on next okay so yep so quite a few cliff faces what's this here some red on the rock interesting it looks like a cool round interesting like little information things here looks like a european car for what it's worth so i do think we're in europe maybe it could be like russia or china or something as well we've got like a big bay i don't really know where to go here to me to be quite honest with you i guess i was thinking like croatian like i don't know if christ is a silly guest here the the climate it's hard to tell how far north or south we are that's what i'll say about this round but uh yeah in in with the lack of any any any other better idea i'm just gonna go in like southern northern i don't know i'm just gonna middle croatia here and hope for the best i don't i doubt this is correct zero points again on like by carl there so yeah i did mention russia should have gone with my gut people have been cheeky and putting you know multiple rounds in similar spots here so can i survive and get at least one point on this round it's the question and uh well it looks like another difficult one it's a cool location again but difficult nonetheless it's a lot of white people here and some kind of cave so is this actually in a museum why why does it look like they're coming from well i guess it's just a cave system of some kind anyway lots of trees here lots of moss i think north america would be a good shot here probably um so i think we've seen similar rounds like uh in like when we have like similar rounds like maybe in like washington state like in the middle of nowhere we have a lot of people here a lot of tourists i'm sure olympic national park doesn't have too much running through it to be honest yeah i feel like this area is a good shot though feels quite far north because it's quite cold looking everyone's kind of rugged up at this time of year uh let's see do we do we escape zero points surely surely we do oh my goodness it happened it happened it was bound to happen eventually guys but here you go that is what a zero point game looks like amazing so um uh yeah what can i say guys um [Music] yeah okay well let's move on no time to dwell on around like that let's just get in here and play the z gate zaggy weird challenge map by crispy crunch cat i like that it's got like a real ring to it actually it's kind of uh it's kind of like a like a little bit of alliteration or something like that but anywho let's get into this one and hope we don't score zero i'm sure i'm gonna get some points on the first round here at least i hope so wow this looks like a face it looks like some lips in the nose and eyes um regardless in a very interesting location here beautiful stars and kind of some desert it's very low quality but you know it has like a definite you know distinctiveness about it with these rocks so just about the sun's just about to go down here and so where abouts or yeah not really sure where where i think this one would be maybe like maybe maybe just like in uh oman or yemen again i always like to guess here when i when i see these kind of rock formations but yeah i mean i have no idea let's let's go for yemen i was one thing that crossed my mind okay we we're still on zero points so six in a row now and that one was in gotland which is a cool cool location okay and this one wow this one is a weird challenge map so inside like a ice chamber here um pape dm interesting interesting so seize the day what's that got to do with all these sculptures definitely uh interesting one so almost like well i know they do like ice ice uh sculptures in like sweden and finland so that was one thing that came to mind but i don't know i don't know i guess i guess i guess finland would probably make sense helsinki maybe not helsinki it might be too warm or on olu olu could could be a decent shot here i feel like carpe diem interesting um so that's about all the clues we get so let's see if it was actually sweden or finland or somewhere completely different okay this time we got 300 points what a win it wasn't very not far north in sweden so we marginally improved our guest there this one looks like stonehenge or something but obviously it's not actually stonehenge itself um but yeah i think southern england somewhere um okay so we have the ocean to the south so that'll probably make sense uh so kind of a jaggedy uh coastline as you expect as you would expect down here so what's this this seems like a national park i kind of like this the dancing ledge probably not the dancing ledge it doesn't seem like as much of a cliff here although somewhat but yeah i'd probably be happy for that isle of wight area of outstanding beauty i'm just trying to look is this actually beautiful no this area is not particularly beautiful uh so maybe also more likely over here well there's a lot of areas of outstanding natural beauty that's for sure but yeah i'm gonna keep it where i had it and wow what's southern sweden so interesting i guess just to have that stonehenge connection we only get one point you kidding me this is uh this is definitely a europe-centric map perhaps otherwise why are our points so low well not this one this one where are we lost dragon godzikata looks like swedish or something i don't really know if it actually would be swedish but would you find anything like this in sweden surely not well what's this to do is come in dragon com like come in like the dragon gate or something i don't know what what the meaning of this is or where we're going to be with 20 seconds to go i'm still flailing uh am i gonna trust a language here i feel like i will actually but surely i would have seen something like this is quite an incredible place really okay well this is gonna look incredibly silly if i get it wrong but i can't think of anything else better so let's just hope this is not horrible what a guess dude this is the best guess i've ever gotten in a fan map video oh my gosh the dragon gate how are we that close oh that is insane oh my goodness that is 21 kilometers away ah oh my goodness okay well um that is quite something anyway here's the next one hopefully you guys can try and beat me on there but uh interesting old cars just trying to make out what they are maybe maybe european or american one of the two probably maybe they remind me more of american cars so i'm gonna go out in the forest in the us here i think uh it could be european though this one here does it say misha okay so maybe i'll go in russia then or belarus or something misha is definitely kind of an eastern european name that's for sure with these scots pines it would make sense to be further north so let's go uh let's go in polatsk let's go outside of pilatsky in the forest here you ready for another insane guest we're going to be like a few minutes north of shell corville and okay well it's just sweden again so mischa i guess you can definitely get some missions in sweden so definitely concentrated on this part of the world this map was um but overall with a guest like that i mean in any normal map where the locations are not so close together that would be a 4.9 uh that that guess right here but yeah guys that is it for the video thank you very much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed it we finally got our worst ever game but also some really nice ones as well and quite an insane guess so guys until next time uh thank you very much for watching and i'll see you guys in a video very soon goodbye ", "image_not_available": [1], "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/6GcJEwXXeeqI0G0J",

"transcript": "what is good everyone it's zigzag here welcome back to another jira guest video good to have you along so we're gonna be playing some unexplored world today on this map you have all the different countries from geoguessa which are not normally included in the world map that we normally play so you have all kinds of countries like zambia or paraguay or costa rica outside of san jose or anything like that and so it's a really good one and i think we're gonna have good fun playing along so hit the links in the description to play beforehand and that way you can see what i end up doing in comparison to you as the video progresses also before i start i want to let you know about two things one i got on the instagram post go follow your boy and give me a like over there and also i'm going to be streaming a bit this week my sister's out of town and normally i keep her up if i'm up late at night so if you're a european or australian or asian i should be streaming at a good time for you and uh yeah it should be good fun so give me a follow over there i'm gonna be streaming tonight but that is just before this video came out so you can go watch the vod as well if you're just watching the video now and you missed the stream all right first location of the day a rather poor quality one that's for sure we appear to be driving right hand side of the road it should be somewhere in africa as well immediately somalia came to mind here because it kind of reminded me a little bit of kenya but a bit drier so that's what came to mind first although i could see west africa easily here interesting the uh trees are painted white at the bottom here i'm not really sure what that would mean but i'm sure it would help with the country if i if i had more knowledge kind of a sandy soil so i'm actually maybe thinking even southern sahara like niger or something like that is even possible here or maybe chad for some reason chad came to mind here i don't know i don't know maybe maybe that would make sense more so walls around the buildings also feel quite west african but look at this we've got um some cyrillic here now i'm looking at this what it looks like it starts for the j my my thought is could it could it be juba could it be juba i feel like juba would be greener than this that's the problem but it kind of looks like it might say juba also i don't think we'd have arabic in juba so maybe this is a poor choice but even though the the word really looks like it kind of has that same outline i can definitely say it says university of i would say it looks like jupiter but i have to go away from it i'm gonna go for chad because you actually do see some arabic there can we see any similar words elsewhere no yeah i'm feeling good about chad or sudan sudan here or maybe maybe it could be sudan because they used to be part of the same country maybe it's like a leftover somehow why don't we do some arabic over here okay at least on the border okay well i'm gonna go for chad anyway but i think it's gonna be chad or sudan here we'll see it ends up being in juba itself no what i was so sure that they wouldn't be using arabic there but i'm wrong i'm wrong i guess because in the north they would be using arabic that's why but such a tragedy that i actually had the right read literally but couldn't couldn't make the most of it unfortunately unfortunately indeed okay this one hopefully some of you guys saw that this one is interesting should be west africa again i would say um and so this gentleman yeah he looks quite west african okay we got the orange number plates that means we should be in cameroon so let me know if you guys knew that in the comments but yeah that is a that is a nice tip for cameron one of the only countries in the world that i can think of that uses any orange number plates and they use quite a lot of them so that's what they look like there and so could we have worked this out otherwise orange money even they like orange money the company um trying to work out if there was actually any french here or anything that could have helped us out but yeah i don't know um so lots of palms feels maybe a bit more coastal this time i'm thinking of going in doala or maybe somewhere near the coast that kind of feels right to me high rainfall area perhaps so maybe some hills nearby yeah that would make sense um maybe even this one might go for that one no no i'm gonna go for this one instead actually um but do we see any elevation actually before i make that guess we don't see any but i still kind of like that i don't think we're gonna be on this half of the country so let's see if i'm right yeah ends up being a good switch uh ends up being down here okay so 4.5 we will take that for sure next one here looks like the middle east we have white number plates here uh could it be africa actually it looks like we have a yellow outside line here in the way that you might see in well for example zimbabwe or something like that i think zimbabwe is another country or namibia also used yellow outside lands maybe does zimbabwe use yellow outside lines i think they do honestly i'm pretty sure they do uh this google car sometimes i mean not google car but this car something like there is like a pattern for zimbabwe um i i kind of like that honestly the the climate probably fits a little bit better for zimbabwe i would say kind of a bit greener than what you would see in namibia i would say with all this grass around i mean there's at least some grass over here but i could be wrong i could be wrong a lot of four-wheel drives and like uh kind of japanese pickup trucks which you often see in africa as well so definitely africa like a bob tree here as well okay um yeah i'm pretty happy with that it's gonna be one of the two and i think i would lean zimbabwe here so let's find out if i'm right ends up being actually in mozambique okay that was tough uh we still got a good score neighboring country was driving left so i don't even could probably consider mozambique and i'm trying to think if there would have been anything to get get me there but i don't think there was so we'll take zimbabwe that's fine uh this one is interesting like the uh coco's healing car here we're driving right it honestly looks a bit european so i'm trying to figure out where exactly we would be with a landscape like this you know it reminded me of i must say it reminded me of romania so i was wondering if moldova might actually be a good shot here well that was fairly hilly whatever is fairly healing but you do get flat sections as well so you know maybe like a northern bulldog but here could work well like a solid actually maybe feels fairly like dry it almost reminds me of australia but look at these houses here not going to be moored over driving right it's a very good quality road for africa but these these houses here kind of do feel african so maybe a north african country of some kind i can see that i don't think it's egypt but where would it be [Music] because i must say it felt like it does feel rather european even still as i look at it yeah we've got wind turbines over here so maybe maybe some of the traditional housing over here could just be i don't know this runs not making a lot of sense to me in in in totality i i don't know it almost feels australian as well which is the strange thing um but yeah i don't know okay with 47 seconds to go we can still consider this nicely definitely driving right huh it's just properly confusing i mean i can't really tell the only houses i can see are really throwing me off um which is just yeah it's just it's just a strange round so i feel like maybe even something out here but why would we have these yurt looking houses moldova or algeria could it be algeria i kind of prefer algeria just for those houses man i really don't want to make a bad switch though um you know what i'm gonna go for algeria here this might be a bad guess but i feel like it's just a little more likely so we'll see and it was in ethiopia that was like that was a really nice road for africa actually so like uh i wasn't i was impressed with that right and actually a really nice landscape and here's the thing with all these mountains in uh in ethiopia you kind of get like these kind of like you can see kind of like a rain shadow or something like that in through the green area and so it's a bit drier than i expected for ethiopia almost like felt like an australian type of climate there so yeah an interesting round um but at least we got the right continent in the end okay this one tk 468 tk huh nanton's building uh what do we got here dickies okay some american brands uh we appear to be driving left that's very useful um supermarket better bargains okay i would say i'm really thinking this is caribbean but i suppose i mean these people look of african descent i would say i would i suppose that it is still possible um that we are somewhere over in um polynesia or micronesia or something but this guy's got a rastafarian hat i i know for a fact that's not only jamaica where you get rastafarians in um in the caribbean in fact a lot of the countries around the caribbean have significant rastafarian populations so um i would say we're somewhere like there really it could be it could be um jamaica i think jamaica youth does use black number plates but i feel like they'll probably have more than five digits or numerals so that is my thought here so i was maybe thinking trinidad um bridgetown i like bridgetown barbados here honestly i do like that i do like that um the hills that we have over to our north so yeah bridge town could make sense for that honestly i do not hate that well maybe it's a little flat we do have hills but i think it's a little flat okay maybe um maybe maybe port of spain actually makes more sense then we do have proper hills to the north uh in that city so i might go for that instead but uh maybe maybe kingston is just to play instead as well like that you also have hills to the north there so last 19 seconds here seems like to the south we have coast i don't know i feel better about trinidad and tobago here despite a lot of american influence so i'm gonna try it let's see and it was actually instant vincent and the grenadines in kingston but not the uh not the king's town in um in jamaica of course spelled differently and so 11 500 you know for what it was that was a difficult seed now had i gotten the south sudan we would have been on 16k which would be a much more uh you know respectable score but 11k is still fine no doubt many of you beat me though with that with that poor sedan and poor algeria rounds but let's get into the second seed here should be should be good fun i mean i really like this map a lot so um and we've had some unique rounds in this episode that's one thing i'll say about how it's gone so far okay this one looks like cyprus immediately we've got like a tall greek style pole here and yep here we have some greek language and uh we're driving left and so there's not much else to say here i'm gonna go for cyprus and whereabouts is the question now uh in the greek section probably well i mean i guess you have greek all over it's just the uh turkish occupied i guess i'm still going to go over in the greek half here greek british half and so it's fairly hilly but not too hilly so maybe just in the center center hedge near nicosia maybe um serie serie maybe or maybe even one of these close to it kind of feels coastal i don't know maybe one of the coastal towns would fit better no i'm gonna hedge in the middle i want those guaranteed points you know and so uh it was actually just in this city here the uh capital of the british sector i guess so yeah kind of i guess i don't really know too much about cyprus but yeah we'll take that's a good score all right the odds are looking middle eastern i would say or maybe even america we have too many south american countries covered so with the yellow outside line here i definitely do like uh middle east and these like european style bollards that almost look like greek style bowlers if i had to say anything but okay it's flat so it can't be jordan or israel presumably it could be like egypt i don't know if egypt uses yellow hearts islands but i'm pretty sure lebanon does or syria so i could see it going there as being pretty profitable like somewhere in the south there maybe um as for other countries i'm not really sure like if iraq would use yellow outside lines like this to be honest i have to find out very soon but okay we got a biker here i doubt he's going to help us much i've got a pole in the distance it's too far away to tell boaz here unique bullets where are these bollards from is the question um what about him what's he wearing not really not really helpful i don't think okay so i'm gonna go southern syria here i think that's the best thing i can think of see it wow western sahara okay um wow we're not expecting that okay well what can you say yellow outside lions western sahara okay i'll you you learn a new thing every day that's uh that's a poor score unfortunately next one here feels like central america we're not going to get anything on that plate it's the whole image is blurry here oh okay and so are we driving left like it kind of looks like i would say it's india actually at first i wasn't thinking oh no could it be timor east timor the thing that makes me think east timor is this pole over here which looks like the southern indonesian poles all of a sudden despite the fact that this is a blurry image i am feeling okay about that but look like look at this it feels like it's uh sergio sergio that's like a south american name maybe or something sergio where would a person be called sergio yeah probably like italy or something like that i don't know so i don't think east timor has italian heritage of any kind though or italian colonial history so clear satellite dish that would be similar to southeast asia hill in the background as well i like it bro i have to say i'm going straight off the poles here this is kodiak knowledge coming in clutch we'll see if i'm right there and so where does it get a bit drier maybe up here um villa interesting why is it called that maybe there is some italian something something going on there oh with the sea on that hook at the end was it um maybe sergio is a uh is it like a portuguese heritage with the hook to see i don't know i don't know we'll find out i guess or i'll find out in the comments presumably when someone knows but yeah okay so also these deep ditches do make me think of indonesia as well so i'm kind of feeling good let's see it nice 49 kilometers away pole knowledge is is really is really the best pro it really is and so we're basically in the next big town i'm happy with that okay next one here round four uh okay this one this should help yeah surely oh it doesn't okay so a bit of english though yellow rear plate immediately thinking of like uh namibia here because of oh it kind of reminds me of wind hook from the pictures i've seen so let's see if i'm right about that um namibia yeah i knew that without the sign that it's very good and so i would say we're in the capital here i'd say we're on the capitol we could probably find if we had a street name here which we do oh but it's looks like it starts with the king kim's i don't really know it's it's too hard to see to be honest i'll just be fooling myself i think but we can we can probably take an easy five or four point nine k here by going in wind talk because it because windwork is really like a sizeable city and then what really else is there not too much i unless you're like one of these coaster ones something i doubt we are it feels like it feels like kind of like inland in the same way that like pretoria does so what johannesburg so i'm gonna go for it and of course i was correct didn't really worry about worrying about ringing being wrong there and so we can almost get 20k here despite one of bad guess and beach cabana dive granada okay we might be in granada here that would probably make sense to have a silent says dive granada and granada poles are painted white like you'd often see in the caribbean as well so that's adding uh confidence yellow plate interestingly which is like glitched so i wonder where that came from and thongs okay um as we call them in australia i guess some foreign viewers would not and so uh granada is looking out of here here it is okay granada i thought was further up here but granada is actually down here and so where do we want to go here we have uh beach beach cabana so can we actually get the 5k here i guess this was kind of a boring round because we actually had the name of the place so let's see if we can get the 5k uh and so that should be 12 well it seems like the ocean we see over here to our north okay beach cabana i think we could probably find this for the last round okay pathway beach blah blah blah the uh the uh beach is actually quite nicely labeled here so i don't doubt that if we search a little longer here we could get okay there's like a bunch of resorts there so i might leave my guests there for the moment and yeah it's not coming to me actually so it looks like we might have to be satisfied with that it's only over here there's more beaches it's a very small country granada population must be well below a million i have a cricket ground as well you know the west indies the west indies used to be like so west indies have their own team in qriket with all the uh west indian countries here and they used to be the best team in the world back in the 80s and into the 90s as well so it's kind of interesting they're not so good anymore but um yeah i guess like it's a similar kind of effect where you know usain bolt usain bolt just like really good sporting genetics over there anyway we uh i guess the compass was wrong or i misread it but it doesn't seem like it was properly uh does not seem like it was properly labeled anyway so went up with 19 000 there and it would have been a spectacular score because we had an easy cyprus we got the namibia we got the granada and we got the east teemo so it would have been a really good score had i known about western saharan bollards so you know there we go oh that was a fun video to film guys i know you guys always like these ones so do smash a like on it and i'll make more and yeah guys thank you very much for watching to the end see you guys in the video soon goodbye ", "image_not_available": [1], "images_path": ["data/images_zi8gzag/Gu4RsCUul7eR4eAT",

interesting what's going on guys it's zigzag here welcome back to another jira guest video today we are back on the fan maps a series where you guys create maps for me and i'm the golden see if i can get a good score they're generally meant to be tricky um but uh sometimes i post some math scores and so hopefully i get some of those today uh first one's by xmani long time fan of the channel and he said it's going to be some tricky and misleading locations this time i'm making a play along by the way so check out the links in the description um so let's put this one in here should be right here and get straight into the first match here so zigzag map that's what you should call it called something like zigzag challenge map make five locations so will the first location load yes it will okay we have some kind of fjord or something like that big mountains um snowy and here is our main clue this village down here so canadian or southern hemisphere somewhere is my main thought it does not really feel too greenlandic or something like that i could be wrong um but it's kind of a distinctive shape so i was thinking canada something like this could be uh could be grease fjord or something like that i mean it doesn't quite fit because it's kind of a two-pronged town although i actually could yeah actually i don't even mind that if that was the first one i zoomed into that would be insane but um something like that i could definitely because it's hilly and in some kind of a fjord what about these ones down here could also fit for sure um but i kind of like where i put it i must say now yeah unfortunately it doesn't quite fit because there'll be more land down here but i hope somewhere near here okay ends up being over here yeah classic classic location um these ones over here so akutan um wow those places are so remote and crazy now this one uh is again in the arctic perhaps okay not really sure what i think of this one though um maybe i should just go for something different and then and and put this one around the georgia and south sandwich islands or or maybe even french antarctic islands or something like that we're in kind of like a lake though i'm like some kind of a bay so maybe like here i could see it why not i'm happy to go for it the sun does not really help us either so let's go for it yeah just going to be spellbound there okay so in this bay here um not going so well so far and now i underwater so i can see why the uh scores were so low um this coral does not really give me anything much so let's just guess in the great barrier reef here uh over here why not let's see oh yeah ends up being pitching island so not not too high score so far this one i'm gonna check down see if we got any clues here so nothing um i was thinking um i've seen coverage like this in easter island i can see easter island being a possibility here we've got white center lines we're driving right hand side of the road ballard's kind of unclear but the the um the climate seems right so where's easter island again i think it's this one here right oh yeah so i can see this one being it and then we kind of got the ocean to our south there so something like that maybe okay nice that was actually the center road there but i remembered that um kind of unofficial coverage and the last one is broken so i like to guess in czechia um and it ends up being in cancun okay so we get 5200 points which seems to be about as many um as what other people got but yeah this was the main one that was able to pull us over the edge there the next one's made by wara kiri and the top scores are about 16k 9k 5k so 5k seems like a reasonable score to get for this one let's make it a challenge shall we and put that inside of here okay now i've accidentally gone at the wrong tab okay let's go for it uh so how many points can we get on this 5000 seems to be benchmark this one seems more gettable immediately somewhere in russia looks like we have like a some kind of a comica colorful fence house could certainly be somewhere in russia this this reminds me of the koreal islands over here um so that's my main thought here though is bit mountainous though so would we get any mountains like that i could we do so yeah i just want to find one that has at least some population on it here seems like a lot of them don't even have any but maybe that one is possible seems like a long island as well um so let's take a look more at these cars there's plenty of people here so maybe we should be further up i could see it being this one though yeah okay so something like this is what i want to say uh really seems like there are quite a few people here um but this is my this is my um opinion especially with this kind of like darker soil that we got going on over here yeah i wonder what it's like living there to be honest um we'll find out where this is but this is my thought okay not too bad near magadan there so we're near ola um okay so there's actually like a cliff on the waterfront here which i didn't know about um but yeah that's cool cool round um okay next one we are in a city some kind of a bustling city here blue number plate so it should be in china somewhere 784 not really sure yeah okay so okay i'll see if we got any like proper clues here if i could read that would probably be very useful but we can't yes it's definitely china definitely china with the blue number plates uh it feels like a big city as well definitely definitely chinese feeling um but yeah i don't really know where to go um just trying to think i i did think about wuhan just because i know it's a big city and you know it's kind of relevant these days so maybe there i mean it kind of feels like it kind of feels correct with the climate because it should be somewhere pretty cold so or maybe even haife hey um i'm gonna go here um ends up being all the way over here uru urumkui so yeah that's a tough round definitely look like a normal chinese city to me nothing to um suggest that it would be up in xinjiang but um yeah whatever three point 369 is not a great score next one we have some tracker immediately this reminded me of british indian ocean territory um just because it's like so idealic filled with like these ferns and stuff like that and palms i bet there's like super white sand over there as well so that's what i was thinking can't remember where this guy's cap is or whatever we can see on top of his head is but i i've definitely seen stuff like that there before so let's just guess like over there shall we well not bad not bad 200 k's away on these ones here okay so yeah british indian ocean territories has a lot of islands in it so that that kind of makes sense that we weren't too close but 4k is a good result all right let's see what's next prayer flags here um we're definitely high altitude probably somewhere in like bhutan or china or tibet or even um nepal so one of those i would say um you can't really tell by the looks of the people she is very racially ambiguous couldn't really tell where she's from okay these guys might look more indian than some of them so i like my like nepal here better um although the mountains are not that tall in all honesty so yeah maybe just nearby there or cashmere even or something like that i couldn't imagine this being anywhere around there but i might go i might just go in nepal where the weather mountains are a bit shorter over here shall i yeah let's go for that okay so it was opposite side in india so that's why they looked indian because they were indian um but uh yeah still a decent scar i would say not bad the next one feels african to me off the bat i just like whenever i see four wheel drives in these challenge maps it tends to always be somewhere in africa so we've got decent mountains here okay we're in like a uh archipelago of some kind because i see i see lots of mountains out in the ocean there but this soil is very orange so it's kind of a strange round i must say so shouldn't be pacific islands i wonder i wonder if it could be a pacific island here you know hmm just not really sure so in terms of africa could be could be somewhere where we get some islands off the coast but no it doesn't really fit to me it doesn't really fit to me okay maybe no it doesn't know tanzania doesn't fit either i'm struggling to think what this beat might be i'm i think i'll just go for madagascar where we have some islands out here uh by no means a confident guess but maybe at least possible here uh okay was australia wow wow uh exact right latitude there but oh that kind of explains the soil color apart from that i was not really feeling australia so there we go we got 8000 which i think was above par above pascal there so if we had gotten a nice china guess it could have all been even better but there we go uh so let us head into the next one here hard zigzag created by no username i think this guy isn't even deleted the discord but should be an interesting one seems like a number of people have gotten good scores though so maybe isn't quite as hard as some of the other ones have been so let's invite people here go over here all right let's see how hard it actually is first one in the middle of the arctic again or no maybe not because this is looking to be asian architecture so then i was thinking somewhere remote in mongolia or china mongolia or china i i kind of thought somewhere over here would make sense you know um not really sure because this house almost feels a bit mongolian to me um i'm i might not be right about that i couldn't say i understand that part of the world too well that's my thought and uh yeah just kind of dryness of it as well would fit for this part of the world like uh what's the it's the gobi desert yeah so i can somewhere around that would make sense okay so it ends up being actually over in india again just the same place as the last one we were just there before and now we're here um but yeah 700 points not not a fantastic effort ah really looked like a chinese building more than an indian one to me but i guess it's right on the border this one is interesting on an island here fairly sparse vegetation feels southern hemisphere if i had to say anything um yeah i can't really tell too much about her or him um yeah southern hemisphere for sure so and we have a few islands here including quite a mainland so there are not too many islands off the south coast of south africa or something i've noticed about south africa hardly any so then maybe a southern i could see it being a southern um maybe it's a bit warm it's a bit warm for tasmania maybe maybe it's one of these ones then it would make more sense i think they're all a bit too flat okay then maybe here okay so cape baron island or clark island i could see this at least i can at least see this the vegetation and rocks kind of seem at least somewhat correct and we can see another island in the distance let's see here oh no it felt very southern hemisphere to me ends up being just tunisia and on zembrera zimbra island sorry um and yeah zero points to show for it so not not fantastic there okay here we have some midway atoll coverage surely look at all these birds yeah this is typical midway at all but i feel like this might be the second well look how small this island is this is extremely random okay so let's find midway tall is here and then there's this it's like there's like some random islands could be this one okay it could be that one because i know there's just some random islands out here that have coverage so i mean would make sense i guess um yeah i'm gonna go for that one i have no idea whether like how i could even work out if it was right or not what about this one actually maybe this is a bit of shape this one's a better shape let's go for that career hotel toll or no okay it was a different different one east island is so random the fact that we have coverage on these islands and not in some of the biggest countries in the world for example not even india or pakistan or something it's just ridiculous why do we need coverage here probably cost them a lot of money to do anyway that's a hard one this one looks like some kind of a gymnasium i was thinking japan off the bat we got mask signs here recent coverage um unless not um a bit of french maybe it seems french to me so maybe i'm just trying to think in terms of uh in terms of you know challenge maps we've got to be something random here french guinea french guiana i mean um could be reunion or any any number of things i i might go with french guiana here just because french past day right unless it's just in france and that would be so that would be such a next level move but yeah as for me i'll go on cayenne see surely not it was just in france on monaco wow in monaco inside the sports hall so it wasn't france at least but um not a good score either and last one's in the pitch black we've got a toyota a couple of toyotas here and a big port i have no idea where this is let's just go on australia just because you know last time we saw some four drafts was australia these blokes could be aussie that's for sure okay so some kind of a harbor then i don't really know i was just thinking i was just thinking brisbane maybe but i don't really see anything that's actually too tempting on brisbane maybe gold coast let's see gold coast let's go for that okay this one was in liberia so i'm pretty sure those guys were white but um but yeah i guess make sense so not with 2 000 points but i think we're a long distance away in this one 43 000 kilometers away so two decent guesses and three that left a little bit to be desired there okay so not to worry let's go in again here this one's by fray kaiser and uh fraukaiser and uh the top score is 24k 6k and 2k so somewhere between six and two is where we should be aiming here hopefully the six side of things but yeah i i don't have um i don't have particularly high hopes for this one either so let's head in here the next oh no i've actually not copied the last one okay well i'll fix that up after uh regardless uh let us go in here and play the map okay here we go white number plate the front oh this one is certainly interesting kind of glitchy as well why not play the front almost feels like right hand drive should be right hand drive so is this just a really nice african suburb that's kind of what it struck me as southeast asia or africa i guess the lanterns look more southeast asian right so maybe vietnam vietnam is something i was thinking about here seems he looks like he's driving left he looks like he's driving right yeah i could definitely see vietnam so i can't remember which is like the richer part of the country but i'm going to go out in this town here okay it was vietnam we get 2 600 points for a haifong would have been a uh a nicer hedge perhaps but but we get 2.6k it's good all things considered oh this one okay this one also feels like a similar part of india no um so yeah i mean could easily be could easily be um so we've got like a valley we've got like some plantations here as well very high in the mountains check out this like a fog or like um this mist feels very high rainfall very high rainfall indeed 30 seconds to go here i'm just going to guess in the same place what are the chances that three guys in a row put a location here and yet i kind of like it i do kind of like it so otherwise over here or even further up into like cashmere and all that um i could see but yeah i like this kind of area here most of all so let's see if it's actually true oh wow iran i'm so sure it was india but okay it makes sense one thing i i thought like without any people it kind of looked like lebanon so that would put us kind of halfway between but we only got 300 points that time okay next one oh interesting ancient architecture this guy strap and young lad looking good all right i was thinking iran again see what i kind of look right or lebanon or yeah similar kind of place this time um of course like turkey or italy are always possible where does he look he could even be north african to be fair berber something like that um yeah maybe north africa here maybe morocco or algeria maybe i might go algeria here you know just trying to look at this architecture definitely feels ancient that's for sure does not quite film does not quite feel tunisian so i might actually go closer to morocco for that reason you know um maybe casablanca here that could work let's see oh wow it was just italy yeah i mentioned that but that's like a very ancient looking place um but yeah very cool very cool round indeed 1000 points okay so we need some good scores to come in now this one's unofficial coverage these houses almost look japanese if you know what i'm saying but i don't think we're there probably northern canada or greenland or maybe even one of those southern islands as well these ones are always so tough you know um but yeah these little houses where are they gonna be maybe northern canada you know um so let's go fort ross is that populated enough could be let's go for it uh okay wow i would i mean so i said it looked kind of japanese we're not that far from japan but yeah we were on this island bearing island here and yeah so we are on booktubeyon temporarily closed interestingly um but yeah is this actually a town okay so there's some things going on there wow a lot of houses that just don't show up cool cool round cool round for sure and the last one here okay big cliff kind of burnt bushfire damage maybe feels like it a thatched roof some thatched roofs okay so holidaymakers here that's for sure um so cultural is something that jumped to mind immediately but the longer i look at it the less i like it hmm but it could be like yemen or something maybe subculture is not even a bad idea you know but i don't think we have a bay like that there do we okay so if we were right here we would see some mosques we don't see any masks so i am that i'm therefore thinking probably yemen because it still has a similar look about it doesn't it um so where do people like to go holidaying here just looking for anywhere where the cliffs go right to the go right to the water because i'm sure there are places like that here okay so yeah it's actually kind of a tough shower let's see ends up being angola south of lwanda wow i mean yeah i can see it but uh it's not a round i've ever had that kind of area is definitely tough so we're not with 4400 so not terrible vietnam being the best guest there everything else kind of ballpark yeah you can see everything was kind of ballpark without being any good so yeah what can you say not not terrible but not great either and here's the last one not even google maps could get 5000 points good luck zigzag there are some interesting surprises so yeah top score of 12k 10k 7k let's go for that um yeah so 10k i guess being our goal for this one i'll see how you guys do as well and put that inside here okay let's go first one here feeling interesting wow okay so dude is going up the ski mountain very tall mountains here so we can rule out australia and many other places um [Music] north america or europe or just elsewhere kind of feels european this building in the background to me could be like uh slovakia or poland i remember having some interesting ski resorts around there kind of reminds me of those french even okay kind of like france i don't really have too much to go off of here though this guy what does he look like i don't know it could be like german or something i really have no idea i'm gonna go for france here though uh do we have any like good ski resorts that i can actually guess on in case in case of an insane guess um [Music] too much in the way mont blanc is here let's go here all right let's go there wow that was in pakistan okay was not expecting pakistan i think probably many of you guys won't have been either ah but that was tough for sure next one's tracker interesting tracker here okay so i'm pretty sure there's some tracker on which island was i think of this one here that looks like it's in in um vietnamese language though maybe these ones here or this one these ones here so i feel like this might have some tracker like this wouldn't be surprising them would we see mainland to the north maybe hmm that's that's the main thing that came to mind was kind of muddy water um but yeah look at this vegetation could be like north american as well that's another thought i had but yeah these kind of islands look quite southeast asian to me so also these ones possible here in thailand any any any indoor islands also possible but i like cambodia let's see okay france oh okay that was tough mont mike mikhail is that actually true what were you right there wow so what islands could we see i guess just that oh wow oh well is that really okay well that i mean it's trekker so it must be real but yeah that was a tough round for sure okay next one uh some kind of a big snowy mountain here i don't quite know where i'll put this one big snowy mountain kind of like yellowish rock which is interesting maybe like a turkish mountain i'm really sure if you get them this tall but if it's the middle of the winter you never know that's the first thing that came to mind sometimes i just like to go on hunters in case in case they're in case they're good you know so we could be up here i don't know it doesn't really seem like too much is going on in this part of the country but i do kind of like turkey it was just my first thought with these kind of yellowish rocks so i mean there's really not many clues going on here so let's go for it surely not right it's not it's colombia so well definitely wasn't thinking that either so i guess i guess uh we'll just have to live with that three points okay so not going well on this map so far yet this one dried up river some kind i was thinking namibia sun is more so northern that light hint towards southern hemisphere like sand bars i actually really like namibia here more than anything else so somewhere out in the desert but also not too deserty somewhere the river something like this because we've got the sand bars slight hills and a river so yeah let's go around there um i think the movie is actually kind of a good shot here but i'm not sure where in namibia or even if we are but i think africa should be pretty safe let's see wow that was vietnam um was it actually i guess so i mean there's nothing to say it couldn't have been to be fair just really interesting so we are we are back on track for a terrible terrible school year let's see if we can get some round five redemption wow now this is interesting play zigzag so we got this guy's backyard presumably we got cricket bats okay um milo two in one grain nickels green nickels um wow so australian then oh this is uh this is a milo two in one qriket back at the bat certainly an australian thing so which capital i i guess like sydney or melbourne makes sense here that's for sure um so i guess we're going to get most of our points on this round ah darker brick maybe melbourne could be adelaide that would be that would be a bit freaky if they were doing it from adelaide but i think one of the three probably makes the most sense here house does like it's pretty tightly packed so i think melbourne or sydney makes more sense grass yeah kind of could could be either this is kind of colder climate um kind of vegetation but it could be anywhere so let's go kind of like more inner melbourne here brunswick area ends up being sydney so yeah that was my second thought ends up being in la yeah like i i stayed in leichhardt and it kind of reminded me of a house near that so um i doubt that's my friend who i know from there if it was hello but there you go okay so sydney is 3000 points uh a tough one a tough one but a very interesting round to end out the video so hopefully you guys uh did a decent job there um no doubt some some of you beat me on every single one here didn't play particularly well but guys thank you very much for watching see you guys in a video very soon don't forget to submit your own maps and yeah till then goodbye ", "image_not_available": [4], "images_path":
