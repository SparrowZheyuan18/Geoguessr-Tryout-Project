welcome back to another geogas playong video and today I'm excited to try out a map called a varied World which I tried in one of my recent twitch streams and I believe hogman has suggested this map in YouTube comments as well so let's do some play along Games The playalong Links will be as always in the description you can play along with a free account as well no moving minute and 30 uh seconds press that like button and let's get going what do we have here we have some a church I guess with a bright blue dome which looks very unique is that the Orthodox cross will this be Russia what do we have yeah we have Russian Russian flag here so it would be Russia where in Russia Russia is a pretty big country as you probably know I interesting bards here interesting yellow sign with a yellow reflector steering wheels are on the left side of the cars well at least that car I don't see any of the other cars sometimes in Far East Russia you can see the steering wheel on the opposite side which could be a clue if you see that but not this time not this time unfortunately with these kind of Vibes I'm getting kind of vibe wise I'm thinking maybe near the border of kazakstan maybe somewhere here is this or more East let's go near Mele maybe let's see okay I was kind of kind of right about the area it was not far from the from the Kazakhstan border good start for for a rush I guess I think that's a pretty good one now what's the next round here we have some hills some mountains visible and uh some houses newly built projects thinking maybe something like turkey or or Bulgaria maybe I am not sure do we have the blue strip I cannot tell I can't tell if we have it would this ever be Russia I don't think so no some pretty pretty high mountains that we're having here I'm not sure I I think I'll go turkey but but I don't know could be Bulgaria or something something there so maybe let's just let's this a bit closer to that area it was Romania okay well I was considering both of those countries as well but okay not not too bad in terms of the score at least got the right area now we have a yellow yellow line in the middle driving on the right side what's up with these poles what is this this we we don't see any antennas some more wind turbines are being built here it seems what are those bull Lords what is this what does it say gate does it say gate in English maybe it says something in Spanish that looks like gate could this ever be us where where is the sun sun is appears to be kind of South maybe hard to see these clouds but I think us would be my best guess here then cuz the polls would fit with the US I think it looks like we might have some English as well so something like I don't know where though let's go Alabama Miss Mississippi maybe somewhere here oh it was Texas very very close to the Border well well at least I got the country right I'm happy with that so this feels European privat Park plot Cen something uh that's German the languages German would this be Germany would this be Austria wouldn't be Switzerland I think that's a German boss stop I believe I don't think you see those in Austria so I would go Germany here then North or South I don't think it's very far north does not not getting those vibes with these buildings the buildings feel more going Central or Central or Southern let's go maybe near Frankfurt somewhere here is oh no it was Austria after all I guess it was not a German boss stop wait let's have a let's have a quick closer look I think in Germany they're a bit different yeah was similar though okay oh this looks like an abandoned place no defin definitely abandoned place I always find these very fascinating I wonder what's the story behind this one so we have a Gen 4 with an antenna we have some of these big thick poles we have some holy pole as well I think this would be Hungary with Gen 4 with an antenna I know you Hungary is one of the countries where you can get that and we have a holy pole that seems hungaryan to me I would say where in Hungary maybe probably safest bet is to kind of hedge I am thinking maybe towards Northern side near Budapest maybe maybe a bit more East somewhere here it was Romania I guess it was a Romanian holy pole after all well you do you definitely can get Gen 4 with an anten in Romania as well I just thought it looked more of a Hungarian holy pole but okay 17K for the first game could be could be worse could be better but I think 70k is okay start my goal is to get uh 20K 20K score in this video I think it definitely definitely should be manageable Heen I hope we stop getting huge countries that would be a good start towards the 20K hidden what does the hidden mean that this this little road is hidden or someone hiding in the bushes well I guess like some some a corner is hidden maybe you can't see around the corner maybe that's what it means anyways this would be us I guess with English well either us or Canada maybe more Canada with a road like this Canada is a big country though let's go new bronswick maybe it was not new bronswick it was Ontario which not the greatest start though now this is a bright coverage my first thought was Asia but is it the house definitely feels Asian yeah the the design that would this be Indonesia maybe maybe I I don't see any other clues that would be particularly helpful here so I think I'll just go Indonesia I could see this maybe being Thailand but that pole doesn't look particularly Tha I would go rather go Indonesia with that pole so let's see and it was oh Taiwan huh okay well fair enough I do not know well I didn't see anything that would make me think Taiwan there let me know in the comments if you saw any uh good clues that that was Taiwan maybe I missed something or didn't know something I'm happy to learn this would be New Zealand I believe these polls look very kiwi like that's an interesting Ballard it's like a kiwi Ballard but green which is very peculiar I don't think I've seen that before so would that be unique to a particular region in New Zealand maybe or did I'm not sure what what with a green reflector maybe it means like the like a turn is coming up or weird I don't think I've seen that before but uh we have some some Rolling Hills around nothing too high so I'm thinking maybe Northern Island we have some sheep that's cute eating grass adorable adorable let's go with the northern Island I think feel feels more Northern to me and no I was wrong it was southern island after all okay let's see we have no antenna here feel like these are some tricky rounds at least for me uh is it Greek that that is that sign is giving me kind of a Greek Vibes I can't not read what it says but just just the blue sign with some yellow letters on it like you see that a lot in grease blue with yellow kind of an interesting combination I don't think it's very readable but that's certainly a design choice but yeah like the the landscape definitely feels like it could be grease sun is to the South I definitely like the addition that you can have two compasses at the same time I feel like this one is hand if it's a close call is the Sun to the north to the South and you can just align it in the middle and see if if the south is closer to the middle or if the north is closer so it's very easy to tell that it's South here so let's go with gree and let's go somewhere here ah it was Greece but it was the cre Island oh well oh well got the country right but the points could have been better now this looks like Indonesia but um lots of words but I I don't think I uh I know any of them we have palm trees around I do not know the pole tops satellite dish is pointing slightly to the north which no surprise is there well let's go what's with the roofs I don't see any tiled roof roves so I would not go Java probably let's go let's give it in K Manana I guess it was not Java it was not K Manana it was East Nara yeah Indonesia is a big and tricky country that was a bad game I feel in terms of the score at least but the rounds were also difficult I would say but let's keep going let's keep going and if you enjoy these videos don't forget to press that like button to to keep the YouTube algorithm happy no we have the blue strip here definitely Europe but which country one plots Pats plots maybe one plot German plots is but when plots be capitalized in German Germans like to capitalize their nouns what would this be that sign looks kind of yellow would this ever be Sweden or something this these SS don't look very Swedish to me I'm getting kind of mixed signals here I do not know what to think this n this sign are definitely not Swedish Denmark ever I do not know I I'm not super happy with my Denmark guess but I just don't know what else to guess to be honest it was Sweden after all huh interesting the signs didn't feel Swedish to me weird okay well at least the score wise it was okay interesting why why did the signs not feel Swedish to me oh what is this we have some water right to our Southwest and we do not see the Google car at all sun is to the north firmly to the north and uh what's up with the poles well this is somewhere in South America but would this be Chile would this be Argentina I I would say more Chile with with water to Southwest especially somewhere maybe like it looks very dry and deserty so it should be kind of the northern part of Chile somewhere what's the road Direction something like slightly Northeast slightly Northeast least ever up here somewhere no somewhere here maybe no it was it was oh it was way way way North oh wow damn it was super close to the Peruvian border it definitely felt like Northern Chile it was super super Northern after all from the first glance um I don't know what to think I thought maybe I had an idea but not really okay it is Brazil Brazil it looks like a Brazilian pole and Brazil definitely would make sense with this kind of a redish soil no antenna visible Brazil one was one of the options I was considering but yeah the the polls definitely help with this decision we have some water here we have these these palm trees very Lush let's go Brazil is a big country and region guessing it definitely helps if you can do it let's go near Bellow Horizon maybe no oh God it was very North near BM Oh Boy only, 1600 points there that was a rough round for me that's what I get for not being able to regenus Brazil what is this Cafe there's some yellow middle lines okay these um this electricity counter with these two small slots would indicate Peru and Peru does have Gen 4 nowadays and Peru does love Tuk TS so I would say maybe more Northern Peru from what I remember you do see more Tuk TOS to more towards north in Peru so let's go somewhere maybe in this city Kara is that how you say it okay it was more north than I thought we weren't we weren't even in a town there were just some houses next to the road not even a town nothing okay well okay well okie dokie oh we have okay that that makes it easier Canyon snorkel and driving left of course so what's the road Direction slightly like that so let's go somewhere here maybe the road kind of lines let's go near nakuru oh no it was so Coastal wow okay I was not thinking that Coastal what the score 17.3 th000 still a little bit away from that 20K that I am eyeing so let's keep going I really do want to do want to get that uh 20K okay we are starting off with a follow car here in Nigeria where Nigeria do you get this this type of car with an antenna the bars sticking out this is Nigeria it has to be with this follow car right just do not recognize this car at all have these these little Huts this is confusing me I don't know well we have some mountains this feels a little bit dry well maybe quite a bit dry so maybe let's go more North maybe that that's why I don't know it Zaria we should we go Zaria well all things considered could have been worse it was very East very Eastern now this looks like maybe Indonesia from the first glance we have a black car here what's up with these poles where would you get these poles we have lots of these palm trees these oil Palms I believe which you get in if it's Indonesia in like Sumatra and kantan mostly this this area we can definitely get them in Asia in Malaysia and uh Southern Thailand as well it's kind of like this this part of the region you would get these palm trees so if it is Indonesia then I think um Sumatra might be the safest bet either Sumatra or west kanton I would guess yeah let's let's guess and let's see H it was West konton I chose wrong lost the coin flip unfortunately very dark red soil that's all we really see there is no Google car no ballards no signs the sun is somewhere up in the sky can't really tell the direction even oh boy what is that this round this map definitely has some tricky locations I feel would this be Brazil would this be a sneaky Cambodia both of the countries definitely can have some dark red soil for some reason Cambodia is calling my name should I should I call back or should I ignore it and go to Brazil okay I'll I'll respond to cambodia's call and then see if that's the right decision no I should have just let it ring and go to the voicemail God damn it bad round terrible round terrible terrible oh okay we have this black car here this is an interesting round um black car very hilly very green this feels like it would be Southern Argentina no somewhere South near a Chilean border how far south though I don't think it would be too South where is there even coverage here maybe there would be some coverage there that might be too North too much North I think so let's go more South you somewhere here maybe maybe even more south let's go Rio turbio somewhere super South oh gosh ah should have should have left it where my first plonk was should just go with my my gut more we have a white car here very narrow road we have some a wooden post here that's falling these these wooden poles look wonky the sun is slightly to the north now where would this be these wonky wonky wooden poles I know you can get some wonky wooden poles in Bolivia would this be Bolivia or would this be Indonesia I want to go Indonesia here I want to go Indonesia don't know which island but I think Indonesia is a better guess oh it was Philippines ah well I was not considering Philippines here but in hindsight makes sense but this sun was to the north though wasn't it I guess sun was lying to me the son is such a liar only 11,000 gosh these are not good games I really want to get the 20K so let let's keep playing let's hope we get 20K this time so I can finish this video otherwise we keep going okay what's up with these PS these polls look Belgian are the plates Belgian I can't tell maybe maybe maybe what is that guy doing I'm sure he is working we have a horse these PS look so Belgian to me and the plates look like they might be Belgian we have this like um Town entry sign which I could picture being in Belgium so I definitely want to go Belgium here yeah kind of maybe Southwest of Brussels okay nice a bit even more West but that's definitely a good start now we have Gen 4 we have kind of a brownish orangey soil that's a big tree I thought it was a pole at first but no that's just a tree where would this be another tricky location that's no that's a pole but I don't find it particularly helpful where is this where is the sun the sun is to the north I legit don't know what to think here Brazil I don't let's go Brazil I I I don't know the Sun to the North austral Australia crossed my mind for for a moment but something felt off I don't know the poles didn't feel Australian to me okay we again they have these oil Palms with this little stubby antenna with this stubby antenna this would be Colombia no with a black car stabby antenna where do in Colombia you get these oil Palms I would expect maybe somewhere here maybe no more Inland more Inland but it was Colombia yeah now this is the Netherlands with this this little bricky paved Road right yes we have yellow um license plates so that's that's a nice an easy round just guessing in the middle is now another European one generation 4 in Winter trees have no leaves um this looks so generic could be so many places in my mind I don't know which countries have Gen 4 winter no idea about that I'm just going by other clues that I see would Germany have Gen 4 winter Maybe let's go kind of southernish Germany close to these countries oh it was Denmark oh wow okay well yeah I I did not know that one 16.8 th000 let's keep going we got to keep going we got to get the 20K we just have to gen uh well not Gen 4 not gen 3 we we have a big long antenna on a black Google car this would be Russia what a start what a start this is Russia right with that car big vastness big nothingness I'm thinking maybe somewhere here is okay actually for for Russia I think it's a great guess for me at least okay we still could get that 20K it's it's a challenge but we could I can't read what that sign says anything else useful around here we have some palm trees oh we have a big Guatemala car that's that's helpful so with this many palm trees maybe more a bit closer to the coast let's go kind of a bit South Southwest of Guatemala City okay was even more West but yeah it was was close to the coast now we looks like we have a wider blur don't we so would this be yes indeed it would be Japan with these black and yellow vertical stripes uh where in Japan I do I have not studied any pole tops or or pole pole metal plates or anything like that so I'll just have to go by my vibes and my what are my vibes saying they are saying let's go with Himi Himi is calling my name not bad not bad not bad at all okay my first out here was Cambodia let's have a look around it's not Cambodia not with this little antenna this little antenna would indicate South America well Latin America which country with these wooden posts would this be Colombia would this be something else with this such a cloudy weather the sun is northish it seems with Colombia boy would this be Brazil this could be Brazil oh boy I've been doing so well thus far I'm thinking this is Brazil now fudge Ecuador let's go with Brazil I think such a big country such a big country let's see it was Brazil I was right but just wrong region and unless I get like a 5k this round I can forget about a 20K but we are in Ghana and I mean it's not a small country but it's not like a super massive one either so we could maybe get 4600 points if we get a bit lucky so what are we thinking a little bit Healy here a little bit Healy I don't see any palm trees which parts are a bit like there are some hills here that's a bit of a risky guess though but I kind of should risk it for for the biscuit there are some hills up here as well some hills let's go maybe here there are a bunch of Hills here I think this might be the safest guess it was a bit more North no are you kidding me are you kidding me so close so close okay let's keep going let's keep going let me know if you enjoy these extended playalong videos let's put it that way cuz this is going to be a long one and a big shout out to my patrons and YouTube members that make all of this possible thank you for your support and if you want to become one and get early access to my videos add some exclusive ones every month uh the links are in the description if you want to join now generation 2 what's the language there's no shot can read that language I was thinking like fance or ever UK or what else could this be let's go I'm not happy with this G but let's get France Ireland o terrible start but let's keep going is this you us double yellow lines it looks like an American style pole I think we have some mailboxes I would maybe go with with northeastern part of us like New Hampshire something like that nope it was Northwest H okay let's finish this game quickly but we're definitely not getting well I'm definitely not getting 20K on this one so Gen 4 dark car lots of palm trees I'm thinking maybe Indonesia ever Bangladesh okay my first thought was Indonesia let's stick with my first thought but maybe it's Bangladesh It Was Bangladesh yeah very very south southern Bangladesh that's why it felt so unique um what's this is this turkey first that was Turkey there might be a blue strip there can we see the text not really not really we have like lots is this like lots of water some sort of a dam maybe nearby or some factories that's not a flag is it this be Romania maybe turkey or Romania I would say kind starting to lean maybe more towards Romania just with these these big poles chunky poles yeah let's go Romania somewhere here is oh okay it was even closer to that water the Black Sea yeah we could see this this L lul hor like some sort of a reservoir I guess yellow line in the middle Gen 4 small small plates okay where's the sun the sun is behind the clouds possibly to the South ever Mexico then with these smallish plates yellow line let's go Mexico somewhere here and okay not a bad guess not a bad guess if I hadn't messed up those those first few rounds would have been pretty good all right another one 20K please I want I want to get that 20K in one of the games very red soil what are these rounds what is this sun is North I think looks like it is North I think this would be Brazil again where are we getting so much Brazil such a big country like was okay it wasn't even Brazil it was very Eastern Peru I feel like in this map you get a lot of like border locations very kind of unique feeling locations kind of weird ones which which for me at least definitely makes it very tricky we have lots of these Nordic feeling houses with some hills I would go Norway here but since we're getting so many border locations let's go near Sweden no it was it was Coastal it was the other side of Norway we have Generation 4 some water there in the middle of a forest H sun to the South I don't know what this is honestly who this ever be baltics no I'd rather go US Canada maybe Michigan no Finland these are difficult and again very close to the Border somewhere in Europe lots of wind wind turbines Denmark maybe not sure if that house feels particularly day though Germany maybe Denmark Germany let's go maybe Northern Germany oh UK huh driving on the right side we have some bards that look okay these are you get you can get these bards in like Russia but also in Kazakhstan with this is the Kazakhstan car lots of lots of things are very similar in Russia and Kazakhstan the Ballard is the signs and let's go maybe somewhere here no it was way more south not even close to 20 this doing so bad so so so bad okay we have this electricity counter Generation 4 a little small plate so this would be Mexico I am certain of that and we have a Mexican pole octagonal pole as well here blue BL nachos not blue nachos I would go somewhere here okay again super close to the Border lots and lots of Border locations in this map so that's something to keep in mind we have a kind of Nordic feeling houses what is that sign Finland ever ever Estonia Finland I'd rather go Finland I feel that sign felt kind of maybe Estonian but but let's go Southern Finland if it is Estonia it will be nearby no it was Finland actually yeah I was right about that so we have some rectangular signs we have an antenna uh rectangular uh rectangular poles I mean would this be Russia or Ukraine I cannot tell I think I'd rather go Ukraine maybe sun is little bit to the South I don't know if this is Russia I'm screwed if this is Ukraine I still might have a chance it was Russia well can we stop with these big countries I want to get 20K driving on the left side here but this this poor quality coverage this should be India right not too bad for India actually pretty good black car somewhere very Southern argen Ina no very very very Southern Argentina ever maybe not that South let's go here oh no that's a good guess that rush I guess that rush I guess okay one more this is New Zealand lots of tires here for whatever reason north or south north or south let's go north North it was South wonderful great start I already lost 2,000 points um Russia again can we stop it so many big countries too many big countries if you ask me let's go I don't know here so Generation 4 sun is South it feels like like like Bulgaria or something Croatia okay Croatia makes sense I'm just speeding up if if you can't tell just cuz I will not be getting 20K in in this location what's with these bricks These Bricks feel almost kind of like um British aisles but the landscape doesn't feel too Bri these houses feel Baltic don't they and this road feels Baltic the white flowers these bricks are weird though I think I'll go Baltic despite these bricks cuz everything else just feels so Baltic I think I would go Estonia white flowers Estonia easy meta no it was Lithuania okay well still weird bricks and uh oh are these Greek yeah we have the double double White Lines we have Greek a Greek sign here blue with yellow a Greek license plate so we would be in Greece I would say one of the islands maybe greet no a different Island felt like an island okay I'm going to wrap it up here without reaching 20K hopefully some other time let me know in the comments what were your scores if you played it along and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy don't forget to press that like button and big big thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel ", "images_path":

of the world I think it should be an easier one I'm in the mood for something easier today so let's try it let's play it from above and see how we do if you want to play it along the links will be in the description if you don't know how to set up satellite view I will leave an info card up there on on with all the instructions so let's have a the 10-minute time limit and satellite mode enabled and good luck good luck we are definitely on a beach here uh not too much information just just okay well let's zoom in let's have a look what do we have any cities okay maybe it will not be as easy as I had hoped I was hoping that maybe since we're on beaches it will be easier to find but we'll see we'll see so the Shadows are going north so we are in the northern hemis sphere and uh very gridlike at least this town is very very gridlike is what I'm seeing can we see the cars what's up with these house roofs they're very bright and looks like we have some palm trees here as well looking at the Shadows of the these trees they definitely look like palm trees so somewhere warm tropical Coastal um almost feels like Australia but Shadows wouldn't go north there I'm I'm not super sure where to guess to be honest I'm thinking maybe Europe but where in Europe would this be with Coast like this there were like Spain somewhere here no it doesn't seem like it with a gridlike town maybe something like Mexico or something maybe us this was wasn't my main guess though but okay this looks kind of familiar I think this might work wait we do have this kind of kind of watery is it actually it I actually zoomed right in on it I think we have a river here oh I mean I'll take it this just didn't feel like California and Mexico was the next uh the next best guess um okay so we're on a beach how do I pinpoint this we have some structures here is it is it this okay wait let's let's let's zoom out again and try to so we're at the end of this big lake so so so we're somewhere here is okay yeah we can see that these two roads merge into one here so we would be somewhere here is I guess a 4999 oh seriously oh no well still a good start though but a bit annoying that it's it's not 5K okay this one should be easier I I would imagine we have a massive City here big airport let's have a look at the airport first o lots of runways every my first thought was like Seattle or something I'm not sure if it like would align but but just with water to the West Seattle just just was my first thought let's have a look we do have very gridlike streets here again another smaller is that an airport yeah it's like an Airfield I guess not airport interesting that's in the middle of the city any stadiums any any any anything of of okay we do have some like a stadium with South Wolverines well that doesn't really help me I don't know where South Wolverines are from it would be South wolverines in Seattle I'm not sure we have um a baseball field which definitely would be common in the US and another another Runway lots of lots of airports and airfields here and another one up here what the hell okay well let's zoom in on Seattle let's get it out of the way no it is not Seattle doesn't really look like that we have some big big mountains here big big mountains to the east Vancouver no no no no no doesn't no no no no no what else could it be was I mean we definitely have water deep water to the West San Francisco I did it did say South South Wolverines so could it be one of these like like San Diego ever no no it is not oh is it is Anchorage okay well Anchorage makes sense with so airports cuz it's like a big kind of Hub or for planes going from Asia to America so yeah airports lot so many airports make a lot of sense and yeah it aligns perfectly with this Fire Island okay this is a Fire Island apparently I wonder what why is the name um but okay so where are we we are on this beach right here I guess it's not a very warm beach if we're in Alaska so we would be with this little little thingy up here and we are uh here I think very nice that's a 5k good oh okay another city this one feels warmer than than the previous one that's for sure let's uh let's zoom in and have a look at the beach okay this one looks yeah lots of lots of lots of umbrella UMAS here lots of cars lots of tourists lots of people so this this doesn't feel as American to me anymore the houses are all over the place the the streets go go left and right and and wherever and the Shadows are going to the north once again so that that stays the same the quality is not the best often times in Europe there will be a pretty good quality not here though so what does that mean that we're not in Europe or H what would that mean so we are driving on the right side it seems it looks like it from the from the cars that we can see we have like a pretty big looking Port as well big roads big Port all white Road lines I was thinking maybe turkey or something like that that was my thought well it obviously wouldn't be Istanbul but turkey does have a large Coastline and they have a lot of beaches so maybe well if it is in Turkey I could not find it I scanned the coastline that might align uh nothing nothing that I could find okay let's get back to the drawing board what else do we have here there's an another city up here um these houses don't feel as European to me anymore to be honest so okay I I imagine this city is not as touristy as as this one so what would that mean we have some roundabouts could this ever be like like like like um Israel or Lebanon or something like that would the coast align like this I don't think Israel would align but maybe Lebanon well let's have a look no would there be Cyprus in this map I'm not sure I think I think the description said locations are where you can move around don't remember if it said anything about them being official or not but the the on ones up until now have all been in official countries so maybe this is in a completely different continent with with houses like the these very Green in some parts in some parts kind of dry if are like Mexico again I don't know this this kind of this kind of City from above is feeling very kind of Latin American to me maybe but like this Square here with some Greenery and then these these gridlike uh streets maybe Mexico is worth checking out again let's let's have a look maybe Guatemala or something is the Shadows were to the north right let me just double check yeah yeah they were not so many stadiums that I've seen I guess this is a touristy City that's why just just one football field and and there is there is a stadium here but no no writings Acapulco ever no no it isn't akapulko might be a nice city to visit though very touristy I think from what I've heard for for a just chilling in the beach I don't have much time remaining and it does not look like Mexico after all at least I could not find a a coastline that would match so I'm in a rough position right now I don't know what this is at all it's not here but it's yeah I don't know like 30 seconds remaining I feel like I've checked everything that I thought it might be um maybe I just overlooked something but I I I'm going to leave it in Mexico but um yeah let's see where was it it was Europe it was Italy H oh wow tarono didn't 2 Italian up here in agip petroli Ila some non-european looking houses up there but okay fair enough fair enough bad guess bad guess by me oh no this looks very tricky oh gosh what is this well the houses is giving me kind of Norwegian Vibes maybe will this be norw Norway ever we don't see any like big fjords but there definitely is a coastline what's happening here very like copy pasted houses all look exactly the same just copy paste and boom boom boom boom I mean looks looks nice nice green not super confident about Norway though but Let's see we have dashed lines here and which set are we driving on would this ever be Ireland Shadows are to the north yeah we are driving on the left yes okay this is Ireland then well that's that's a good start we know the islands the British Isles so it's somewhere there somewhere there so this doesn't look like a big city at all like a small small town town with a beach nearby um maybe this thing could help well I'm not entirely sure what you call it in in wa what's happening here wait wait wait wait wait what's happening here this is underwater no it kind of looks like it would be under water are those like like some some fish growing things or do you go fish do you grow fishes in these tubes like fish farms or what are these I'm not sure let me know in the comments if you if you know they they look underwater to me huh interesting um anyways yeah maybe maybe this thing could help what what whatever it is called my English isn't that that good I don't know all these very specific terms oh is it it kind of looks like it might be yeah it is I mean that was much faster than I thought I just yeah okay um let's see so we're on this side here Gold Coast I feel like there's so many places called Gold Coast in the world lots of gold coasts I guess and we are how do I land this there is like a road here this the road it's like a gated community oh that's a golf resort oh that's what it was oh and these are like these golf each separate golf field maybe oh there a bunch of golf Hills down here yeah okay cool cool cool so we would be pretty much here right nice Okay good guys good guys that looked like a Sandy Beach we have some houses with different colored roofs Sandy roads quality is not the greatest where are the Shadows where are the Shadows where are the Shadows the sun is very high up so there are no Long Shadows at all barely any it looks like they are slightly to the South so Shadows would be okay slightly slightly to the South it seems so could this be ailand or something maybe okay what's up with this town here this seems like a bit of a bigger bigger and paved town are we driving on the left side is my next question can we figure that out this is the biggest road of the of the city it looks like we are driving on the right side which um goes against my expectations I really thought this might be Australia but I guess not I guess this would not be Australia we're definitely driving on the right side here what would it be then could this be something in South America then maybe Brazil or something like that can we see any road lines maybe that looks like a white middle line if I've ever seen one or is it white with yellow could this be something like Argentina or Uruguay huh maybe I mean why not I mean why not Argentina Uruguay is there anything that we can align just a straight Coast just a plain straight coastline with a small River there's a small City here a little bit bigger town there let's try to align the angle the best I can somewhere here I don't see well that's definitely not that river that we have for a second I thought wait is it it is that it but no I don't think it is in Uruguay this this angle works pretty well I think can I find a spot that works though no the angle doesn't work exactly could have been somewhere here is maybe but do no I don't think it is so much time looking for it somewhere here and and it isn't so I don't know where it is at all I thought it might be this River but no driving on the right side lots of Sandy roads Brazil maybe I think Brazil is is a good guys might be super tricky to find it though but okay I I'll try it I'll try it let's scan Brazilian Coastline and see that might be a tricky Mission but I'm I'm here for it wait what's with this oh my God that's the same river as before I thought it was it most of Brazilian coastline is very very like rugged is that the word very all over the place so there aren't too many places to scan even and this angle doesn't work anymore I'm afraid I'm not going to find this one either I scanned the whole Brazilian Coastline and couldn't find it could this not be in South America where else would it be driving on the right side southern hemisphere looking like this the sun is very like the Shadows are very Western I guess technically it could be Northern Hemisphere still somewhere in Africa maybe ever let's see quickly something aligns no well that was quick not too many countries to scan in Africa but nothing really aligns there either yeah I'm I'm at a loss here I thought I scanned everything I thought it was could have been couldn't find it still kind of feel like it might be somewhere like Argentina Uruguay but let's see it was Uruguay it was Ur oh the oh my God the very border ah I overlooked it I scanned Uruguay then I moved down to Brazil I didn't scan the very border such a silly mistake it was where I thought it was just oh boy that's that was a bad round 177,000 in total this is definitely more tricky than I thought it would would be I thought the beaches oh just align the coast and then you're golden but no apparently I'm struggling with it but okay let's do let's do one more we should have time for another game again Link in the description if you enjoy these satellite videos press that like button it really really helps the channel and if you like the content consider becoming a member or a patreon to get some more exclusive videos as well and early access to to my regular ones too but okay so let's see let's see um this island becomes dark and again bright is what I'm noticing lots of lots of ships that's the first thing that I see lots of ship traffic all around the island like everywhere a small and a mountain s looks like we have like a like a bigger Coastline to the Northeast so okay let's maybe have a closer look at that bigger maybe Mainland we have a big fancy pool here what's that some sort of a fort a castle that immediately makes me think European like these the some old Forts and stuff some [Music] mountains would this would this it wouldn't be like Gibralter here there I was thinking maybe there's some somewhere in that area but no I mean there are some I can quickly scan the area but but I should probably investigate the location a bit more still lots of pools on this island very mountainous I like that how you can feel the depth look while looking around how it feels the much closer and that's more distant again that's really cool looks like a place for lots of tourists lots of these beach chairs with with um umbrellas Sun guards lots of these windy roads definitely feels European everything's very packed together all the the space is very used up it appears that we are driving on the right side of the road I would say and the Shadows are going to the north too okay oh boy that's another big beach honestly don't get the appeal of these these types of beaches where you have like your own like spot among so many other people just I don't know I guess I'm not a beachgoer in general so where in Europe with this be feel like like surely it's somewhere Mediterranean surely has to be right so let's scan not sure which country though um we are driving on the right side and again in Mediterranean most countries drive on the right side so this this type of Coast I'm thinking maybe Italy or something oh this yeah yeah okay found it it was Italy I was right about that right of the coast of Naples this is Isola isia that's the place isia I guess isia is the the city on the island of isia there other towns on the island of is and we would be in like Panza or foro somewhere there this definitely looks like a very touristy Place have you been there let me know in the comments it looks like a cool place to visit it um are we somewhere here I guess um so many small windy streets like here I think we are okay yeah okay okay okay good good start now this is not Italy anymore I don't think this feels more American maybe America Mexico something like that very gridlike again notice that immediately here this looks like a very American style intersection very car Centric like like how many lanes in One Direction like six or or eight even yellow middle lines it seems so yeah definitely looks American so with a coast to the West Coast to the W some mountains up here H well this wouldn't be La too small what would it be this feels like it could be California potentially but but where exactly no is it here oh I think it aligns yeah it is AR Aro Grande this this city Grover Beach and a Royo Grande it just felt so American like I felt like this one was a pretty easy round so where where where do we have is this row yeah it's this road that gets you right on the beach this beach looks nice without as many people I mean there still are people but it's not like everyone has a designated spot so we would be right here I think nice next round the water looks so cool with texture I first start was Europe here maybe oh let's have a look at the city nearby very Red Roofs definitely getting European feeling here I I would say European Vibes ding on the right side of these look these These are these water towers or or some other structures around ones pretty big looking Port so some big ships on the port here Shadows are going north yeah so where in Europe would this be looks like we have a pretty deep water to the south of us we're driving right now there's another big city up here let's we see some dashed lines here will this be France with these dashed lines I'm thinking France or Romania or something like that let's have a look at France southern France ever no but the coastline is too too rugged too all over the place for France nothing really would align here so Romania ever Romania has a very small Coast there yeah the desel also doesn't align Spain think Spain can have some Dash lines as well I mean Spain isn't a bad shout I think and it definitely has a big Coastline so let's see very green though I would have expected the southern part to have a bit more dry Coast but but maybe maybe the coast is greener thinking maybe Italy couldn't find anything in Spain but Italy I think could be a good shout as well Italy has a big ghost feel like I've scanned all the coastlines I just can't find it it is somehow evading Me Maybe it's somewhere completely else where I haven't thought if that's the case I will take that l it be Greece I don't know why I didn't think think of Greece earlier but could it be Greece has so many different coastlines everywhere even if it is somehow Greece then it's I have too little time for that now I don't know I've seen so many coastlines let's let's stay in Italy but Sweden seriously what oh wow okay I was in a completely wrong area what the hell the houses I don't know they just felt more Southern to me wow oh the dashed Road lines of course well Sweden does have dashed Road lines but I I didn't even consider it it felt more Southern to me oh god oh wow okay that was a surprise to me okay big mountains here right off the bat I'm thinking maybe Norway Maybe Norway let's have a look at the houses uh maybe not Norway this feels maybe US Canada somewhere wait the Shadows wait wait what's up with the Shadows the Shadows are going to the South huh huh okay well this would be um Chile or Argentina southern Chile Southern Argentina somewhere there right has to be with shadows to the South and mountains like these oh might be tricky to find where though cuz down here there are lots of mountains lots of like these these ridges and we're looking for a small small small town small small small town in between lots of mountains how am I finding this there is a bigger city to our East here as well so maybe we could use that to align things there is like an air air strip Runway oh is it here maybe I think it aligns well is there an air strip Airfield is there there yeah it is there is an airport here cool oh okay for a second I got a bit worried there that I might not find it but no it it's it's definitely here now all we need to do is pinpoint what is this thing again for maybe like growing fishes or something so we are like here is let's see okay it is 5,000 good good good and the last round let's see again looks like a an island well I can't see further than this but it feels like it would be an island okay this looks very tough what would this be let's have a look is this a city this is a city kind kind of dark um dark roads driving on the right side these dark roads making me think maybe Brazil maybe maybe maybe dark paved roads driving on the right side the Shadows are going to the north okay still could be Brazil Brazil is in both hemispheres but that kind of narrows it down a little bit if it is Brazil this mountainous Brazil had some islands here but I don't think they really work and these islands wouldn't be as mountainous well there's this another town down here with a roundabout and everything this ever be like a reunion would it in reunion the sou the Shadows would be to the South though yeah it doesn't the line could it be somewhere canaries maybe or something like that that this one doesn't align I don't think this one aligns either I don't think this one aligns either uh I was hoping I was wait could this be no I don't think so for a second I thought it might be it but no could it be no it wouldn't DN I thought canaries was such a good guess Madera doesn't work either aor ever no oh gosh I thought it would surely be one of these islands but I I I checked all of them out I'm pretty sure and I don't think any of them fit so if if it turns out to be any of those it's completely my fault um I I should have found them what else could it be what else could it be is that a yellow line yellow Middle Line there I got such a red volcanic soil I think it's volcanic I don't know such a red soil Hawaii ever let's check out Hawaii I haven't checked those islands yet wait is it actually it is it is okay yeah the coastline aligns perfectly I'm glad it is cuz if it wasn't Hawaii I would have zero idea I mean not too many islands that that are this mountains that have official coverage first that was not Hawaii though so we would be somewhere here how do I even align this there's this house down here we are next to this house I believe okay how did we do in total 216,000 yeah that Sweden round threw me threw me off but if you play along let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another playong video I think you will enjoy don't forget to r that like button and big big thanks to all my

video if you want to play along for free of course the links will be in the description as always let's have a minute and 30 time limit no moving and we are playing an apoc apocalyptic world did I did I say it right an apocalyptic world that's that's the that's the word so lots of kind of dystopian looking locations abandoned places lots of lots of cool stuff so where are we we have some holy poles that I see definitely feels like Europe with white Road lines middle lines Generation 4 son I imagine yeah it is to our South no surprises there this feels like some old old spa or sanatorium or something that's been long abandoned some hotel we see some language H there is some language on those signs but it's too small to see doesn't help much we do have the blue strip on that c as well well my first thought was something like well with the Holy poles I without the holy poles I would have guessed something like Bulgaria maybe since we have some holy poles I'm thinking maybe Romania so yeah that's that's what I'm thinking so let's go Romania feels a little bit heilly here we have some some hills around so let's go maybe somewhere here is kind of central a it was okay it was Hungary after all I guess those were Hungarian holy POS H just I don't know the Vibes were felt more Romanian to me so it went with Romania there okay this is an interesting one very very wet a very wet place there's this house on stilts here we have a pickup truck Petro so what's the language there P pind it feels like either Malaysian or Indonesian I would say language wise do we have um I don't see any front plates on that motorcycle I don't think so I would say probably Malaysia then or is that a front plate is that a front plate so would this be Malaysia or Indonesia or am I tripping and this is something else I don't know I'm I'm feeling kind of Indonesian maybe because of this this this plate here so Indonesia we have water well you have water in a lot of places in indes IIA doesn't doesn't feel like Java the rofes I don't think would fit well I don't know what to think here I don't know let's go somewhere in in in konton maybe oh not bad actually actually not bad at all it was a different city but I got the island right and I wasn't too far at all let's go oh what is this this is some sort of like a farming equipment right I think h some big poles I don't they're not super helpful to me I mean maybe feel kind of kind of maybe Romanian but I'm not sure Generation 4 I don't see any texts on this this machine I think it is a like a farming one right maybe if if you know let me know in the comments if if you know what this machine does cuz I'm not entirely sure but I would guess probably Europe somewhere not too much to go by but okay let's go Romania since that was my first thought again this time it actually was Romania this time I was right with my we whoa okay this is cool what is this feels surreal what is happening what is this place I have never seen it before it is turkey isn't it with the bards I think the Landscapes would also fit fascinating let's go somewhere we have some mountains some Green Mountains so let's go northern part of turkey maybe okay well it was northern part just more West these bards would be Italian usually usually Italian we okay we have some some more old ruins abandoned places looks pretty big and and grandiose maybe some famous play some more cool looking buildings definitely feels Southern I would say southern Italy with these types of houses the the just giving me the The Vibes we'll we'll see if I'm right or not yeah don't don't have much else really to go by just the bards and The Vibes so let's go southern Italy somewhere here okay I'll take that 46 km only what was that place it was some some Museum okay cool cool cool the final score in this game 21.4 th000 not bad not bad let's go for another one let's go let's go link is always in the description all right we have these railroad crossing uh signs paints here no front plates on that car I do believe this is the Uso this this is Esco feed m Reena chose definitely looks abandoned yeah definitely looks abandoned fits the theme of the map everything else looks looks well kept though nicely mowed grass oh we have a flag here mhm yeah well it is America the US sub a um with no front plates I'm thinking looking like this Kentucky didn't have front plates right let's go somewhere like Kentucky was more south it was Georgia all right okay well makes sense what is this now looks like they haven't cleaned up here in a while this looks terrible this looks just just not good they should definitely do a cleanup here where would this be we have this white Google car or light gray white Middle Road line I can't tell which side we're driving on where is the sun the sun is right in the middle maybe a little bit little bit South a little bit South I don't know we can't really tell which side we're driving on cuz we're kind of in the middle oh this stop this line is this like a stop line which would indicate we should be driving on the left side I thought was maybe something like Malaysia Indonesia so if we are driving on the left side it would kind of confirm my suspicions we're running out of time I think I'll go Malaysia but uh I don't know it was not Malaysia we were driving on the left side the sun tricked me but it was very close uh it was South Africa huh okay interesting interesting looks like kind of a very remote part of the city I should definitely clean it up okay okay first thought is the US OFA with these kind of the style of housing but let's let's have a look around Aura Cosmopolitan Club we definitely see some English here General Store Foods General Store food are we driving on the right side here the poles not sure about these poles where is the sun I'm kind of getting New Zealand Vibes yeah the sun is to the north I I was think at first these houses felt American but the more I look looked around the nature and I'm thinking that Poland distance also feels kind of kiwi which with that what I think might be a posum guard so yeah with the sun North I'm definitely more inclined to go wait wait this is gen two did New Zealand have gen two or not maybe this is just Australia oh boy would this be just Australia not sure if New Zealand had okay I'll oh boy let's go let's go New Zealand it was New Zealand I'm glad I did not doubt myself this time cuz I often do this time I just followed my go and that's a very good guess I'm happy with that 59 km off ooh is this uh Russia is this Russia with the the surut sand looking sand and this kind of kind of um these these these not not clouds not fog this but I think it was because of the forest fire the smoke like very like Smokey where was it though oh boy it was somewhere somewhere I do not remember exact the exact place was it somewhere here was it closer to surut where was surut I was trying to find where that that forest fire area was was it ever somewhere here I'm not even sure if there is coverage there okay it was a more North it was here I like I knew it was somewhere here but where exactly okay it was a bit more north than I thought okay interesting well yeah that's an interesting thing for you to know in case you didn't that's that that uh Smokey meta okay we have some abandoned cars here with bunch of cacti this is a fascinating place what is this what is this this is official coverage wow this is really interesting with these types of cacti I was thinking something like maybe Mexico maybe southern us something like that where is the sun the sun is to the South yeah it says Phillips on that sign there but it's a company name it doesn't help too much I'm thinking maybe us since it's such a random coverage maybe it's like like like somewhere in the US maybe near Mexican border not sure a little there's a little some some hills here uh which parts are more hilly here somewhere here Tonto National Forest maybe somewhere here near Phoenix it was near Vegas okay Nelson Nelson Ghost Town interesting guided tours of a deserted mining town interesting really interesting the score here wasn't as high but I feel like this map is really really a really good one so let's do let's like it and let's uh go for one last game we have a low camera here um where in Japan would this be this is some sort of a dam it seems does it feel apocalyptic maybe this part kind of does is that a trash pile not sure looks like it might be we have some cars around yeah I don't know where in Japan this might be let's just guess let's say near Nagoya somewhere along this River maybe there are some dams somewhere H it was more North it was more North well okay okay this initial thought for me was either maybe baltics or Russia something like that we have some possible seral C to say we have a long antenna here so I would probably go Russia with these white bricks but I'm feeling it might be near Baltic somewhere in western part of Russia would this ever be kinian even not sure about the antennas if if that could work or not but yeah I'm thinking somewhere somewhere here maybe even there but okay let's see not bad yeah it was Western Russia was a little bit more south bans they're pretty much where I thought it would be okay wow some sort of a car crash I hope everyone was fine here yeah the the whole bus has burned down well we have uh driving on the right side yellow middle lines this car has no front plates the are some others do I'm thinking this would be Southern us right or no we have this this yellow rectangular sign hiding there the sun is to hours south I don't see any helpful texts on these these rescuer cars sometimes you can see like what's the W WT something something what could w stand for not a state a could a be for Arizona cuz this feels like Southern us like from the na nature I think let's go with Arizona cuz of that a on that that truck that's what I'm thinking somewhere somewhere okay it was not Arizona but it was close it was California sheephole Valley Wilderness all right oh we have a bunch of abandoned or unfinished buildings 60601 62 a lot of them the sun is to the north hm interesting what has happened here my first thought was southern Africa maybe the nature the long grass astini ever the long grass meta not seeing any texts any useful signs anything really so with the Sun to the north Long Grass looking a little bit mountainous and hilly with green Green Mountains I think I will go eswatini I wouldn't be surprised if it's South Africa or something but it should be nearby I think I was hoping for something a bit closer but okay it's fine okay some more abandoned cars broken down cars what would this be my first thought was Argentina but uh we have the black car would this ever be Uruguay maybe with a black car as well I don't see any license plates license plates the car license plates would be quite helpful I can see some uh chickens and a rooster but no license plates are those black license plates in the distance it's really hard to tell if they are black they would be Argentinian if they're not black they might be Uruguayan some children playing there some horses ugu had lots of horses no we have a palm tree I'm Prett torn between Argentina and Uruguay here kind of want to go Uruguay to be honest but it's like a 50/50 for me I'm really not sure but let's go Uruguay I'm leaning slightly towards Uruguay it was nice I chose chose it correctly how was my score 19,000 if you played along let me know in

official locations the other one has five unofficial locations and for each location zigzag will share a little hint that should help us to figure out where that location is press that like button and after this video check out zigzags one where he plays the maps that I made for him it will be in the description so let's begin with the official one let us do so okay what's the hint here okay so the hint for this round Peter is the record high temperature in this town is 39.9 De despite it frequently falling below minus 30 it also receives about a sixth of reger's annual rainfall okay interesting so clearly very dry well we're clearly in Mongolia um very dry and yeah very high variation in temperature as like in here that's doesn't sound like a pleasant place to live in that's for sure um so where in Mongolia might we be and there even is a flag here oh there's some interesting script on that house it doesn't look like the the usual Mongol script and I'll be honest I'm not entirely sure what would that imply um probably somewhere closer to some border maybe uh possibly or some some local local language possibly um I don't see anything on like that on the map though so I don't think that's too helpful since I don't know what it means okay so we have some mountains to South West uh Coca-Cola of course it's everywhere every wants the Road orientation like kind of like like that North Northwest a little bit well it's not Anan B I can tell that much so what are some smaller towns that show up this [Music] one I don't think it aligns perfectly let's I'll just zoom in on a few but I don't want to spend too much time here just and the mountains to were to South South Southwest where is there some mountains somewhere here that might align there are some mountains down here so maybe what are the buildings here there is like uh some some gas station here to our East where is is the I bet it's on the wrong side but uh I think I might as well guess here I think it sort of aligns okay nice great start okay I I feel like a get bit lucky but the mountains definitely helped there that's why such a big like variation in yeah makes sense cuz of the desert yeah okay let's continue with the next round so oh we have El Dorado okay what's the clue here okay this city was founded in 1795 it has a population of 51,000 and it receives frequent frosts and fog frequent frosts and fog so maybe okay we have some uh palm trees oh which are was it founded again 1795 with a population of 51,000 51,000 okay interesting interesting so we have some white pretty big plates palm trees would make me think Coastal um what's the language is it Spanish or Portuguese I think they seem more it seems more Spanish from the words that I I can see I don't think it would be Argentina with all of these plates so Uruguay would I think would make the most sense here yeah so I don't know which town would it be 50,000 people so something Coastal would it be Mont Vio is it 50,000 at the time when it was founded or 50,000 now 50,000 now it 50,000 51,000 in 2011 which is the last census so it wouldn't be wouldn't be mono that's for sure and also the uh frosts and fog clue is kind of in comparison to other parts of the country I believe mhm Frost where would you get frosts and fog in Uruguay what's which part is different than others anything with higher altitude or something ugu is pretty flat in general I'm not sure if there are any where is the peak if that's the case here not sure which direction the water is I think we might be somewhere near a coast maybe not Coastal exactly maybe somewhere here oh more North not too bad so what do you know why they they get so much Frost and fog in that part or is it just so I imagine there there's a bit more elevation in that part of in that part of U like the East is kind of a bit more elevated so okay probably just in like a small Valley or something I'm not entirely sure this is what Wikipedia said okay fair enough fair enough okay not too bad so what do we have here next one this entire locality and its culture is declared by UNESCO to be a masterpiece of oral and intangible Heritage of humanity oh wow masterpiece wow so it's a culturally significant Place interesting well the first thing that comes to mind is that it feels kind of Baltic I think with this pole especially get these poles mostly in in baltics in lvia and Estonia uh this doesn't really feel entirely lvan so I think I'm leaning towards Estonia here where in Estonia though I have no clue and we don't any any signs just just by The Vibes quite flat but then again most of eston is pretty flat that doesn't help too much maybe something on an island would would I feel like it's kind of a risky guess but I feel like on the islands there might be some some different communities which might be uh un might be on the UNESCO Heritage list kind of kind of a risky guess but Estonia isn't too big so even if it is wrong then then it wouldn't wouldn't be too big of an issue let's let's go somewhere oh wow nice guess enu interesting I I to be honest I didn't even know that Island existed I was going to give you the name of it but then I I was worried that you might just know might be famous in the btics or something no this this island I know cuz estonians even though it's closer to laia estonians have stolen it so it's Estonian Island I know about that one but yeah interesting Peter wakes up every day in a cold sweat exactly owns that Island all right let's move on what's next okay hold still because you're looking into another subdivision oh to the north there is a town and it is named after a fictional character and it is in another subdivision from where you are right now okay okay so a different subdivision we have okay we have kilometers per hour we have yellow line sun to the South so I think we would be in Canada so we're looking at a different subdivision so we're we we're somewhere on the border of provinces so it's a little bit hilly but not too mountainous so I don't think it would be Alberta uh British Columbia border this it's it's way more mountainous than this I feel I think it might be uh too heilly for this but I'll still have a look and the uh the yeah the the other part of the Clue the the town is named after a fictional character and you can definitely tell when you find it you tell okay so the road is going kind of like like slightly Northwest so I don't think any of these roads would align could it be somewhere here welcome to Alberta sign but there isn't any town there so that wouldn't be it quite a lot of roads but but nothing that grabs my tension here on the saskatch one Alberta border onion onion lake is a great name but it doesn't fit the bit the hint unfortunately nothing interesting there okay I don't think it is the Alberta Saskatchewan border let's have a quick look here on Manitoba saskatch one if anything grabs my attention another thing that concerns me maybe it's a fictional character I don't know that's another thing is I don't think I know too many fictional characters but I imagine if the name sounds like a like a character maybe um maybe I'll still recognize it so what do we okay there are some cities here fenlon and criton flon would a flylon be a character I don't know maybe in some some cartoon Flint fla I've never heard of flint flon in my life would the road align turn slightly to the West there and slightly to the east in the north doesn't work there would it be somewhere here do we have do we have houses along the road I don't see them but there there is a road here like a small one there isn't a road here so do we have an so is that is that a like a petrol station or okay I'll do a Qui quick quick additional scan I mean blin flon sound sounds like maybe maybe is some sort of a character but I've never heard of Flint flon before might be a Canadian thing Canada I don't think Canadians and and and latians get the same cartoons maybe not probably not I think that Flint fla might be my best guess here I don't see anything else that that really would work so maybe that road does fit maybe that small Road just isn't on the map oh it was a okay okay so it is Flyn flan the character yes indeed ah did you know that before or is that a I I just thought it was a funny name so I just haded to research it ah okay okay interesting but yeah no wonder I haven't heard it before I thought maybe it's a known character that I'm just not educated in cartoons right yeah I don't know I don't even know where it's from to be honest just some Canadian maybe Canadians in the chat can tell us about it in 1991 the US Journal Islands magazine counted the beach in this town as one of the as one of the 10 most beautiful beaches on earth oh wow it is it is also the largest settlement within 70 km radius oh wow okay largest largest settlement with within 70 kilm somewhere Coastal since we have a beautiful Beach and we have Icelandic Ballard so we're in Iceland definitely looks like Iceland as well so we have a 12 12 I think that might be how you pronounce it oh nice um N1 station like a fueling station Bali I don't know what that means so I this might be might be the place name El so so is that I I think that is the beach to our South CU in the all the other directions we have like mountains there's a church beautiful Church on the Hill so Coast to the South largest settlement within 70 kilom so I imagine it might be on the on the map visible if it's the largest in the area so would it be somewhere up here or would it be and Iceland has such a like a rugged is that the word Coastline that it uh if the water is south it still could be could be say the word yes um but okay we have quite a lot of mountains around us would that help there are lots of mountains up here lots of mountains up here mountains down here as well so I don't think it's too helpful it still could be could be all those places and also some some mountains here yeah I I don't see it I don't want to spend too much time here um okay I think I'll go go with this maybe see if that's right or not oh it was down here okay Vic oh I think I had plunked in vic for a second but I didn't see Vick anywhere on any signs so it didn't guess there there lots of things that said Vi at the start of the word but nothing but okay I see ah oh I think that big sign said yeah Vic with something else so yeah okay not sure why but I I thought you know it's a little bit little bit okay yeah I mean I I could have noticed but I didn't yeah but but that's that that was a good one so 235,000 though I'm I'm very happy with this score feel like you I feel like you had a good effort I was particularly impressed how quickly you got the Estonia but I tried to be a bit ambitious including a Baltic location I guess the pole gave it away for me and just The Vibes the Baltic Vibes I don't know I just I knew you had the Vib I'm from here so I get the Vibes time for The Unofficial map let's see what unofficial locations you have prepared oh interesting Kier Mir okay so what's what's happening here you are looking down at a diamond mine it is one of the largest excavated holes in the world mining has now ceased but the name of the mine written on the hill does give a clue to the name of this Northern Town interesting this is such an interesting location I think ker Mir well ker like ker like like I don't know the exact definition but in carer you like like you mine for things usually uh and me is like me was the world I think in r in Russian um diamond mine you say so I know you like the biggest diamond manufacturer I think is Botswana I think the second largest might be Russia if I remember correctly so with cilic I think what from what I can see I could see this being Russia um I don't see why not kind of the houses definitely feel like they could be in Russia and with cilic with the diamonds diamond mining hint I think Russia is definitely my best option here so he said the name gives the clue um about the the town doesn't look like a too big of a town pretty flat it seems I would probably go in the Asian part of Russia somewhere uh not not too close to the mountains though I did mention in the clue that the it is a Northern Town oh Northern okay so I should look more Northern thank you so anything starting with me or something that shows up m m maybe and Russia has so many towns that it's inevitable that some will have similar names so I wouldn't be surprised this this part I feel like is too mountainous I don't think it could be there would it be anywhere here another M another mney so I'm not I I I don't have my Russian Vibes on point I'm not sure which Vibes fit better both of the towns would be kind of Northern my first thought was the the Asian Russia so should I go with my G I think I'll use my lucky coin got got my lucky coin so heads heads Heads is Asian Russia City tails is European Russia okay it's heads I'm going European Russia then got to trust my lucky coin on this one wait but I I I guess I can align wait why am I using my coin when I can have a look maybe the the thing is on the map I Pro probably should have done that first um before before the coin yeah I don't know why why that didn't OCC occur to me so where where was the other Mir it was somewhere here meu oh meu miruga is also an option no but that's too small that is too small there's nothing literally when you zoom in um where was M it was somewhere around here no how did I find it like so quickly first time and now I don't see it zoom out zoom out even more you can see it oh oh it's that that visible yeah it's a big town airport is there okay there is di Metro Russia Mina Mina would be a mine uh almasi ker Almas I think was like a some sort of a gem I'm not sure if it meant diamond or not but it definitely says like a ker here Kier Mir so I think okay I think this is the one I don't think the other one fits I'm I'm glad I didn't trust my lucky coin and I decided to to investigate this further okay nice was a good idea not the lucky coin okay nice oh what is this here you can see this country's iconic orange license plates this was taken on the main Highway of the country and is nearby with to a town that has a name similar to my own name okay uh so Oscar uh so Town similar to the name Oscar orange license or zigzag or or okay or is exact okay okay this would be an African country this is the main Highway you say yeah okay not the fanciest Main Highway maybe but not not the fanciest I've seen I'll be honest yeah I I'm not sure which country uses orange license plit to be honest so that's that's an issue here there isn't much else to go by so which side okay I don't see the steering wheel on this side for this car at least so that would make me think we're driving on the right side cuz I'm not sure probably some car is is has been bro has bro is broken so people are helping out looks quite Green from what I can see lots of greenery grass so nothing too dry so wouldn't be mly or anything like that I don't think Nigeria ever or Benin maybe Benin seems like a Green Country I have no idea about the license PL colors though but it feels to me like it would be somewhere in kind of this this kind of western western Africa region maybe maybe like Central African Republic as well Cameroon one of the Congos maybe I I have no idea I'm just naming countries at this point I was I was hoping you would know the orange license plate um thing but I will give you a clue in the absence of that you have mentioned the correct country so far I have okay I have mentioned it so which countries did I mention I mentioned Mali which I don't think it is I mentioned Benin I mentioned Cameroon Central African Republic and Congos and Nigeria I didn't mention Nigeria okay let's have a maybe a quick look maybe I notice a town similar to zigzag so this is the main highway so let's look along some highways do I see anything similar to zigzag I don't see anything like that in Benin in Nigeria I feel like the highways look better I don't think it's Nigeria uh Cameroon anything zigzag like which one would be the main Highway wait oh camon goes all the way here but I imagine it might be too dry up there Central African Republic not too many places starting with the letter Z let's go maybe Central African Republic near Cameroon somewhere there ar oh there is a z Place starting with z at least I think that's the first one I've seen so I don't think it is there but let's just let see go go there oh it is up here I said it wouldn't be oh my god zigu oh wow damn oh that's a great name oh but it's so small it really shows up when you really zoom in very closely okay that's why I didn't see it interesting that's a that's a cool name for sad when he said no it won't be there well yeah I kind of dismissed I thought it would be drier up there but I guess not orang license plates are uh pretty much exclusive to camaron very nice tip for un official coverage maps okay I I'll try to keep that in mind that does sound like a useful one this town is located on an island we're looking at the South Co the the town is on the south coast and we're looking Southeast here um so the compass is be wrong okay um and it appeared in one of my Vlogs and I ate a delicious fish burger there one of your Vlogs I know you did a vlog in the Kangaroo Island would this be the kangaro Island where was The Kangaroo Island it was somewhere here the southern coast it could be maybe seal Bay okay this is a town there is a river here so is there a river somewhere no okay there's like some sort of uh God I don't remember how you call those pinula of some there something like that so maybe that could be of help there is something like that here is this the river Elenor River that's the only River I've seen here so maybe it is it doesn't look like a massive River so maybe it is that one there there is like some there are some roads there is some sort of town here so the houses are on this side of the river but I think this is my best guess I don't see any other rivers on on Kangaroo Island ah wait was it flick flipped maybe I don't I didn't quite understand I I I think you're right I think the river's just missing somehow yeah there you are mouth of the Harriet River oh okay that so that wasn't that River oh okay oh that that explains a lot of things actually yeah the river just isn't there fair enough I thought it was this River that is really interesting indeed I didn't realize that it wasn't well at least this River was there otherwise I might have gone somewhere completely else well you didn't know about the orange license plates but at least at least you did remember the zigzag I I have watched it I remember yeah back in the day probably few people watching this video would would remember but Peter does let's go I do I do and I got to say the fish burger was busing I'm actuallya things that's delicious okay you're at terminal one of this country's largest airport its furthest direct destination is Munich its closest is cuun cu jant okay Discord message you the name of that town okay I'll be honest Q does not ring a bell um I do not know where KU is but I know where Munich is so that's the furthest one okay so we I I noticed some cilic terminal one we have some cilic here some more cilic and Latin oh we have these these uh interesting letters with a little little tape this this K anx that you see in like in the Stan countries I think was it in Kazakhstan that you saw them I think yeah here here is like an example on the map so maybe Kazakhstan maybe some other Stan but I would think somewhere in that area so this is the largest airport so I imagine Kuan might be in that country possibly now I don't see any Flags anywhere I was thinking maybe something here is a flag but it's really hard to tell and we have cilic so kujan I I'll I'll do a quick scan maybe I notice KU jand in Kazakhstan I feel like I would have seen Kuan who bistan did bistan use cilic they don't use cilic at least on the map oh kujan is here hello uh and I do have some cilic it is Tajikistan part of Tajikistan so that's the closest flight so would it would it be from Tashkent maybe or would it be from Tajikistan itself from Duan I don't think they use cilic in um usbekistan do they I can't remember now but at least when I don't remember I usually guide Myself by Google Maps what what languages they show but surely for for Bish Al mati surely would be the closest flight I can't imagine there not being a flight between the two cities and if it's the largest largest uh airport surely it's in the capital I think the shanbe makes the most sense here the shanbe International Airport let's maybe see if we can spot something what do we have here we have some chocolate drink store we have not sure what this is is there a chocolate drink store somewhere here Center Bar is it enter par uh I don't think it is don't see parvis anywhere is this the chocolate Choy this some sort of a Choy I think it's a tea tea house or something would this be a tea house oh parvos oh it says parvos here parvos oh so this this Parvo parvos is there I think the par parvos seals the deal it has to be here oh oh here is the chocolate house okay yeah that makes more sense yeah you could see it for a while but okay nice at least one 5K cuz all the other ones were like I think like 4999 or something final round of the video okay this one um you're looking out onto the Indian Ocean you can see a national park on a far Island which is called s s an Marine National Park and the 5K is in a place called zigzag Ward oh wow okay but they have top virtual tours okay not not helpful so we have very somewhere very green so we're looking onto Indian Ocean this is definitely giving me Island Vibes right off the bat and we have some islands islands in the distance as well that's the national park St Anne National Park and some smaller Islands here as well looks pretty nice actually bunch of wind wind generators and and and very tropical very green seems like a nice place okay well I guess let's just zoom in on a few few Islands this seems a little bit like mountainous so it wouldn't be malds or anything like that so we can eliminate I think British is yeah British Indian oan Territory was also super flat so would would be there ever Cocos Cocos Islands or Christmas Islands here I think they're also cus islands are very flat I think Christmas Islands mostly also pretty flat some little Hills it seems but there aren't any islands around that we would be looking towards okay what else do we have we have say shells there are a bunch of islands around so that already grabs my attention cuz there do seem to be a lot of islands do we get any oh St an St anarine National Park okay we are looking towards it so and the compass is about right I imagine yeah okay so we're in zigzag lots of zigzaggy roads but I don't see it's saying zigzag anywhere we see these islands here to our very North I think that the shape looks kind of similar to this uh I feel like I might as well guess somewhere here it has to be somewhere but I just don't see the five oh so just as I say it I notice zigzag W right where I've bloned it I probably was looking all around it all the time okay let's I I think this is probably it so was right on it so okay nice nice very good locations I I enjoyed this one thank you 23k good score pretty good yeah very nice thank you essentially perfect scores apart from the uh apart from the Cameroon oh The Cameroon one yeah that was yeah I didn't know about the plates but but very good Clues I could not have done it without the clues honestly and and thank you for for making the maps you most for comp Peter thank you for having me on and uh don't forget to check out the other side of the collab as well if you haven't already cuz Peter made some for me as well do zigzag says go and check out his video right here but if you have seen it already check out this one up here where we did a collab a while ago where we also played each other as Maps don't forget to press the like button and a big big thanks to all of my YouTube members and patrons for supporting this channel ",

we're going to play a map called geoguesser in 20169 the interesting thing about this map is that it contains locations from all over the world so we could end up anywhere as you can see the average score is only 4,800 so it's going to be a tricky map so good luck to ass Soul the play along links as always will be in the description if you want to play along you can play along with the free account as well good luck good luck to us all let's see what do we have okay so what is the writing the writing looks Chinese uh what else definitely some Chinese symbols I'm thinking could this be maybe Tibet or something like that maybe I'm kind of getting that those types of Vibes I'm not too confident but I'm kind of liking that guess I think I don't see anything else particularly useful just just the some some language and the general architecture and Vibes alassa I believe is the capital of Tibet if I remember correctly and uh yeah I think let's go there okay it was not Tibet it was China so that wasn't too hard to guess but but yeah I thought the BET might be it but no it was Kun Ming okay fair enough fair enough enough but still I'm pretty happy with that guess my goal is to beat the average score which was 4,800 so I'm almost halfway there and of course if you play along let me know your scores in the comments and press that like button if you like this playong videos so I know to make more of them it really helps and supports the channel so what is this here so some some brick buildings some dark skinned people here we have very Sandy very light sand here very kind of dry looking as well some Greenery but very dry um so with all this into consideration I would maybe go I wish we know knew the the driving side that would be helpful so I don't know should I go like Botswana or something or should I go like Sagal or or somewhere in that area Angola we go Angola CU I imagine it might get like this area would be much Greener maybe something like Mali or or ner but I think I'll go Angola I'm not happy with this guess okay wasn't too bad actually I'm glad I didn't switch last second I was considering switching to Molly but okay it was Zombia zombie it was Africa I was thinking it's probably not that Coastal which is why I considered the switch but okay I was not thinking zombie I would have thought it it's Greener there but I guess this is a bit of a more of a drier area there no what is this these stripes yellow and black immediately make me think Japan here so I think this would be Japan yeah feels very very Japanese um where in Japan I know I should study the pole tops and these uh little metal plates I do intend to study them just haven't gotten to it yet but yeah you can use those to identify where in Japan you are but uh without that knowledge where do I think this might be I'm kind of feeling more towards South for some reason feeling more south southern Japan let's go somewhere here okay yeah it was even more south but yeah the vibe was right pretty good score above already above average so I'm happy with that what is this flag here oh is that um Taiwan chese flag with the sun and we have we do have Chinese language so okay we are in Taiwan it's already a pretty good score guaranteed I do not know what it says here probably like Taiwan or something do we have any phone numbers I I often like to use phone numbers in Taiwan if if we spot any uh we do have some but I can't see the code or if we have any like like phone code there okay where in the one I'm not sure looks quite flat so generally the more flat area will be towards West we do have some palm trees here as well I think so I would go the coastal near here oh it was kinman County it is part of Taiwan as well oh oh wow okay that was a tricky one what is the city Leu yeah I I did not know that it was there but still a good score for this map at least we have this pole this waffle pole driving on the right side judging by the sign I'm thinking senal maybe I know Sagal has some waffle poles Hotel tatas the quality is not very good I can't read much po sounds French so I'm thinking a French speaking African country that drives on the right side and has waffle poles I mean Sagal would fit probably like cir sier Leon do they speak French there I'm not sure um but I know for a fact that Sagal has waffle poles I wish we saw some cars cuz in Sagal they have blue license plates I'm thinking maybe let's go cot deoir just to spice things up let's go senagal let's go Sagal after all I was considering switching to codir oh it was Benin okay okay yeah maybe I should have switched to codir would have had a more points it was Benin I see well overall 13,000 points could have been way worse I I'll take that but let's play another one let's play another game uh again Link in the description of course let's see oh takes a while to load we have Korean language right off the bat with these vertical lines and circles we are in Korea not North Korea no this wouldn't be North Korea this is definitely Ely South Korea uh phone number 05 05 phone code uh was I don't remember the exact City but Soul was like 01 maybe 02 05 was something like deu or or Deon or something like that I think so maybe let's go deu does this this feel like a mountainous Place can't really tell but I think Deo is a good shout if it isn't Deo it should be somewhere in in the area yeah it was it was Deo right right outskirts of Deo very nice good start for this game my first thought is was Turkey then I noticed the yellow lines and now I'm not so sure anymore I mean in Turkey you could get yellow lines sometimes the sign looks yeah the sign is Turkish and then this pole looked very Turkish to me as well uh and these are Turkish bards too most of the city names are not readable unfortunately edig hurat I imagine those are very small places cuz they are very nearby I would say that this is somewhere maybe here is yeah let's let's guess there oh it's very close to anara actually well okay but still the right country that is good already above average again so we have some Portuguese language with this sea with a little tail Portuguese so would this be Brazil would this be something completely different we have some houses in the distance would this ever be regular Portugal like just Portugal we have some windmills I think the houses that we see feel more Portuguese than Brazilian just looking at the architecture the plate it's blurred so much I can't really tell do we have the blue strip there we might maybe but really hard to tell but I think regular Portugal we're out of time um Regular Portugal would be my guess maybe cuz it is a little bit Healy I think the vegetation works yeah okay it was it was Portugal yeah okay nice that was a good good round now we have a black plate here is the first thing that I notice driving on the right side would this be something like two IA maybe I know Tunisia has black plates the architecture the the sandiness is giving me kind of either African or middle eastern Vibes with the black plates I'm not sure about the other countries but I know for a fact that Tunisia has black plates we don't see any language we don't see much really yeah I think I think let's go Tunisia on this one not super sure but but I think that's my best guess oh boy wait Angola drives on the left side no let's have a look oh no Angola oh my gosh I hadn't mixed up Angola does drive on the right side you can tell by the arrows I thought Angola still drives on the left but no Namibia was the last one to drive on the left here on this side okay that was a big mistake but uh mistakes happen I already have a better score than the first game White Rose the professional dry cleaners okay we have some people hanging around Punjab Punjab I'm driving on the left side well Punjab was it not yeah it was like like a region in India we have some is that AR rabic new fancy hairstyle and massage scent massage is a bit misspelled we have a lot of Arabic here a lot of Arabic which makes me think maybe it's not the the region of Punjab would this ever be Pakistan he Valencia clean Valencia I I'll I'll still keep it here if it is Pakistan we're still not too far okay it was Pakistan it was yeah oh there is Valencia it said Valencia but but okay interesting that we had multiple Punjab plates I wonder why maybe like lower taxes if you register it in India or something okay let's go for one more game cuz I really like this map let me know in the comments if you if you like this map or or what other Maps do you prefer to play or what other Maps should I try uh to do a playalong video in I am all ears all ears this feels more European for sure looking at these houses this one feels kind of Nordic here in the back the other ones not so much I'm thinking maybe something like Germany somewhere somewhere here is maybe a bit towards north with more Nordic influence I think that might be my best guess here this house feels kind of German as well maybe let's see okay it was checky okay well fair enough fair enough still area was sort of right so I'll take that now this pole feels very Brazilian this kind of a letter pole is that Portuguese maybe but this definitely feels Brazilian with the poles the landscape very very Brazilian feeling let's go somewhere here oh it was par okay Paraguay makes sense as well I'm not well informed about paraguayan poles but I guess they have similar ones to the Brazilian ones I guess it was Spanish after all and that's sign I couldn't really tell Sami we have some satellite dishes driving on the right side it seems lots of posters all around Community Center so we have English brus house I don't know what it means English driving right Healy where could it be Camaroon maybe no Cameroon has both French and englishspeaking populations okay we're running out of time already um I think I'll keep it in Cameroon um but I oh oh it was Ghana interesting okay fair enough okay kind of makes sense as well yeah this is a pretty Place very very beautiful beach beautiful palm trees nice houses wherever this is this is very nice where is it where is it this like some sort of an island nation or something like that these beautiful beautiful waterers giving me kind of Indonesian Vibes maybe lots of bikes this wouldn't be the Netherlands yeah I'm not sure somewhere very touristy very pretty Fiji he would this ever be Fiji somewhere I'm not sure let's see it was an island it wasn't V oh it was SE shells I don't know how I could have known the the right Island I went for a touristy place but but the wrong wrong Island we have some Arabic on the sign we have these kind of baggy pants as I say baggy pants met I would say that this is um Pakistan We Trust buggy pants met I think we always have to trust the buggy pants met we have a yellow plate on that car no flate on this one are we driving on the left side we are so Pakistan would fit I think we have to go Pakistan here so enter oh we have a Pakistani flag here oh that I mean that helps as well but we already had the the baggy pants met so flag wasn't needed shall we go laor or Islamabad or somewhere else let's go f FAL laad let's go there oh no it was oh W it was very very self Karachi all right so 10 10.7 th000 for this map I think it was good let me know in the comments how you did on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy don't forget to press that like button and big big thanks to all of my YouTube members and patrons ", "images_path":

for you I will be going head-to-head in geogas against none other than Chad GPT which is an artificial intelligence chat bot that is surprisingly good at geoguesser we'll be playing a few different maps with various difficulties will my skills and experience a geoguesser be enough to win against the AI let's find out we'll begin with a map called a community World which is the most popular Community main map out there and the way this will work is I will play the challenge myself first to find out what's my score and then I will play it as the AI by sending it screenshots and submitting wherever it wants me to guess if you want to play along and find out if you can beat the AI the play along links will be in the description you can play along for free let's set it to no time limit and no moving since that's how CHT will play it and good luck good luck to us all so here the first thing that I noticed is that we have a low camera I think one one area where I will have an advantage maybe hopefully is all of these metas that Pro players use that c GPD might not know about like the low camera camera Generations different Google cars Etc so maybe that would be an advantage cuz the low camera is telling me that this would be Switzerland okay not too bad 68 km okay this is very very different than the previous game very dry we see these kind of brown bricks Generation 4 camera sound should be to the north is it to the North it's kind of kind of in the middle maybe a little bit to the north I'm suspecting this being Peru we have a water tank there but I'm not sure if that means anything but I think this would be Peru so let's go somewhere here in these mountains maybe a bit more south oh no it was more North it was Peru but I got the wrong region Peru can be quite difficult region guess but we'll see maybe AI finds it easier okay I I do not want to see signs like this cuz I'm I'm afraid that CH GPT will know where these places are I don't these seem like small Italian towns somewhere looking at this this uh landscape I'm getting probably Northern Italy Vibes yeah I don't don't see any of these places I'll just keep it somewhere in the Northern Italy somewhere there okay not too bad all things considered 4600 points not too bad run number four now out of five there isn't too much to see here just big fields what is that sign oh that's not a sign that's a blue house in the distance this is a tricky one this feels a little bit maybe like baltics but not entirely these houses don't feel too Baltic to me so I'm thinking maybe like Poland Maybe feel like I've seen similar France before kind of more inclined to go France that that blue house is weird for France but but I think I will go let's go kind of Northeast France to be a little bit closer okay it was Belgium okay all things considered I'm very happy with that round cuz I wasn't sure at all okay this is this feels very much like uh South America I would say which country tree would this be though we have pretty wide plates bunch of palm trees would this ever be Uruguay feel like I've seen similar poles in Uruguay okay it was Uruguay a bit of an the other side but okay the results in total 21,000 not too bad from my side but let's see how the AI does the prompt I will be using is let's play Geo guess sir I will provide you pictures of the location from Google Street View and your task is to guess where you think it is as closely as possible describe your reasoning provide coordinates of your guess in format latitude longitude just so it's easier for me to paste it in Google maps and see where it wants me to guess so let's begin let's see where it thinks we are so we have this top compass on just so CH GPT knows which direction we are facing and I will make sure to submit everything that I think is of any value to figure out where we might be so here are the screenshots of the road and the the landscape so let's see where Chad GPT thinks we might be the Rolling Hills and lush green field suggest a temperate climate well-maintained roads and pastural Landscape indicate a developed country with strong agricultural Roots buildings are typical of central European rural architecture type of trees and crops are consistent with regions found in Central Europe Road markings and type of barriers are quite common in Switzerland and Southern Germany given these observations I will narrow my guess to a location in Switzerland which is known for its picturesque Country Side roll Hills and similar Road and agricultural landscape well we already know it is Switzerland so oh boy I am feeling quite scared honestly so where in Switzerland does it want me to guess kind of north of Ben I I'll guess as closely to this as possible okay well CH GPD was closer in the first round than I was so great start for the AI not so great start for me but okay let's see this one might be a bit tricky here for the AI let's see the landscape is arid and desert likee with sparse vegetation suggesting a dry climate the mountains in the background indicate a rugged terrain the canal is a significant feature implying that the area might be dependent on irrigation for agriculture or other uses the buildings and the overall infrastructure look like they are in developing or less urbanized area the combination of desert and mountains is quite common in certain regions this landscape is reminiscent of parts of Peru particularly the coastal desert regions that are punctuated by irrigating agricultural areas given these observations I will narrow my guess to a location in Peru likely somewhere in the coastal region where such Landscapes are common let's see where exactly wait is that a I I I will ask it about it okay it gave me new coordinates let's see if these ones are not in the C it keeps giving me coordinates of Panama but well let's keep saying oh let's guess Peru okay it guessed in in the water again but this time at least it's near Peru so I I I'll use this one these large language models are just generating text that uh they predict will be correct so then they don't actually understand what they're saying so there might sometimes be some some weird things that don't make any sense so I think it's as as close as we might get here so let's see still guessing water it's still closer than my guess let's see oh boy this is this was the one with the text well let's let's make sure to submit these signs well of course it read the text from the signs the wooded and mountainous landscape combined with a narrow wind winding roads are typical for the appenine mountain range in Italy the leafless tree suggest it might be late Autumn or early winter indicated temperate climate so let's see does it actually want to want us to guess in Italy yes yes indeed my mic was muted for a little bit while I submitted the photos but I made sure to submit the even the posters just to give some additional context the presence of palm trees and the overall Greenery suggests a warm climate likely subtropical or tropical buildings are simple and single story typical of small towns in Latin America signs are in Spanish indicating a Spanish speaking country the dirt roads in general layout resembles those found in rural areas of countries like Uruguay and Argentina a it narrowed down to Uruguay I was hoping it might go Argentina let's see if the coordinates are actually in Uruguay well they certainly are well it's closer than me even in this round I think the c g PT was closer in every single round wasn't it well if we if we ignore that Miss H with Panama guessing Panama coordinates it was closer with in every single round let's move on to a map called a balanced World which often contains kind of trickier locations so maybe it can throw CAD GPT off or maybe it can throw me off we'll see and if you enjoy this video don't forget to press that like button it really supports the channel and and keeps the videos coming right off the bat this is a Brazilian poll so I think we should be in Brazil and we have some phone codes 98 90 phone codes are in the northern part of Brazil where exactly we 98 was 98 up here maybe we should hedge like somewhere here in the middle of this area I cuz 90s were definitely up there okay it was more East yeah I guess 98 was here good thing I didn't guess uh very North okay well score was rough but but I I hope chpd doesn't get closer than that we have this black Google car the houses feel very Asian either Malaysia or Indonesia I think we might have a front plate there which would be a sign of Indonesia CU in Indonesia motorcycles often have front plates okay let's go Indonesia CU of that but I'm thinking it might be kantan oh okay not bad actually very good I'm I'm happy with this guess next round I feel like I'm doing thus far I'm doing better in this map but I I probably jinxed myself right now we are driving on the left side here yellow middle lines which would make me think maybe Thailand that advertisement says jagle which doesn't help much there's some houses on stilts which you can definitely see in Thailand as well not exclusively to Thailand but it's it's definitely there there it has some mountains to the West these are not the typical Tai poles though so I'm thinking maybe this is Indonesia again I can't tell if it's an Indonesian plate there in the distance or not but it seems like it might be so I think I'll go Indonesia because of that plate and these poles not being the typical Tai poles if it is Indonesia I'm thinking maybe somewhere here in these islands Maybe okay I'm super happy with this guys super happy with this guys here we have son to the South we have this big uh sign where would this be I'm confused I don't think this is a Spanish sign no we have some geese here this sign feels kind of Western European I think Germany would be a safe bet I don't know if this would be Germany necessar L but wherever this is I feel like it's near Germany I don't think it's the Netherlands cuz of the plate Denmark I'm not sure but let's go Germany it was Denmark after all that blue sign felt a bit Danish but okay well well that's why I guess Northern Germany cuz it kind of felt like that area well it does say Chihuahua here which is a city and a region in northern Mexico could this be Mexico it certainly could we have mountains we have a yellow Middle Line we have American style truck with this kind a bigger front oh and these are Mexican bards here so this is definitely a Very Mexican location I mean cars travel doesn't necessarily have to be Chihuahua but I think the landscape the vibe fits with that area so I think let's go near there okay it was a bit bit more south all all the score wasn't as high as in the previous game but I think my guesses were better if that makes sense well let's see how the AI does so the first game was not too good AI beat me I hope I can beat the AI in at least one map today let's first submit the pictures with the overall Vibe and then I'll zoom in on the signs and submit them separately so the sign is Portuguese buildings and power lines are typical of urban or semi-urban areas in Brazil okay it knows it's Brazil well since it speaks Portuguese the presence of air conditioning units and the style of construction further suggest the tropical or subtropical climate the Lush Greenery and palm trees are indicative of a tropical environment which is consistent with Brazil okay well it does think it's Brazil does it think it's the northern Brazil let's see if the coordinates actually fit yeah it is BM it is it is the correct area well first round AI is closer again but I think there are definitely some trickier rounds in this game so I still have my hopes the houses are single story and have a style that is common in Southeast Asia the use of Tils on the roofs and the general construction style points towards this region the tropical plants and overall Greenery suggest a tropical climate the dirt roads with some signs of water pooling are common in rural or semiurban areas in tropical countries I will n my guess to a location in Indonesia as the arital style and environmental conditions are a good match well let's see where in Indonesia it's a big country it is hedging BS in the water between K Manan and suoi sometimes real people players also hedging the water in Indonesia so it it's a valid strategy okay I was closer I was closer and I am leading in the uh in the total currently oh this one was a tricky one I almost went with Thailand I'll make sure to include the front plate and this poster cuz cuz they were helpful okay first time it's very off the flat Open Fields and sparse vegetation suggest an agricultural area the trees along the road are tall and sparse typical for of a savannah or dry tropical climate the paved road with clear markings indicates a fairly developed area presence of a truck with people on top is a characteristic of rural Transportation methods in certain regions oh wa I didn't even notice the people to be honest the truck in the distance has some riding and AOG logo that looks familiar the overall setting suggest a location in the rural part of Central America or Northern South America well I guess it didn't consider that we are driving on the left side which is good for me given these observations I will narrow my guess to a location in Honduras okay well let's see where in Honduras Honduras doesn't even have official coverage but fair enough if Chad GPT wants to guess Honduras that's what we are going to do of course I could give him like some hints of did you notice we're driving left but that's not the point of this video so yeah I'm going to still send it here okay CH wants this to guess here that's what we are going to guess and that's a big goose egg is that is that the expression zero points the flat Open Fields with sparse vegetation and a few scattered trees suggest tempered climate the drag Rass indicates a region that experiences cold Winters the gravel road and the presence of a 40 km per hour speed limit sign suggest a rural area with low traffic the European style speed limit sign indicates a location in Europe the car has a European license plate which further supports the idea of a location in Europe the sign with a bird silhouette and a text likely indicating a nature reserve or protected area is a good hint the overall setting with its flat landscape and Rural infrastructure is reminiscent of Northern Europe possibly Denmark or Germany that's what I said in these observations I will narrow my guest to a location in Denmark okay let's see where exactly it's guessing the Eastern Denmark Eastern part okay so right here well it was closer yeah it was closer is it going through all the all the locations that we had or okay chpd went crazy I'm not sure what's happening there let's start a new conversation with the same same prompt as before so the landscape is arid with sparse vegetation suggesting a desert or semi desert environment there's a prominent mountain range visible which can help in narrow down the location the road seems to be wellmaintained and is a single Lane Highway with a solid yellow line coming in North American highways the truck has Del real branding with the phone number that includes the area code 614 and mentions Chihuahua they strongly suggest that the location is in Chihuahua Mexico and also if you're new to geoguesser this can be used to kind of understand the reasoning how you can come to different conclusions just make sure not to use it in any competitive environment obviously cuz that would be cheating but for practice I think it see this seems like a really good way to kind of understand how to come to a certain conclusion I was a bit closer so in total I think I won this one yes I did yes I did well just because CH GPT fumbled the the third round with Honduras guess the all the other rounds were super close actually and for the final game let's play a map called an extra extraordinary World which contains beautiful locations from all across the globe as you can see it's a difficult map because of times it has unofficial locations where you can't use your regular meta that you would usually use in regular games so I think chpd might have a pretty good Advantage here I will be surprised if it doesn't win oh but this is an official one okay this is an official coverage which is good is this a border this seems like a border post maybe a German border post in German colors and there's another one here so I think this is a German border somewhere so we have Germany seemingly to our east Southeast and a house like this like a Danish plate or I can't tell what that plate is could it be Belgian German border maybe this house doesn't feel particularly Nordic so I don't think it would be Denmark this be Switzerland cuz this house feels kind of more maybe Austrian Swiss something like that let's see oh no for some reason I thought Germany starts to AR East but Germany ended to our East we were in Germany okay that was a silly mistake for some reason I didn't consider we could be in Germany I just assumed that we're outside oh what is this oh no okay I do not recognize this boat coverage I don't know where where this boat is so we have to go with our gut I I don't know if I don't think canaries have bolt coverage but I don't know where else to guess let let's just guess somewhere oh was Christmas Island it crossed my mind but I thought it wouldn't look like that well from the bright side I don't think Chad GPT is going to get that one so this is the first unofficial coverage which means it's with was made by Google what does it say govern govern something government Governor looks like it could be English this definitely feels very North I'm thinking maybe Alaska Alaska would probably be my main guess maybe could be somewhere Canada could it be somewhere like Anchorage somewhere here near these big mountains Portage let's see is it there okay it was not there oh wow it was South Georgia and the South Sandwich Island South Georgia Museum King Edward Point well those are British overseas territories so it makes sense why there would be English but I just thought it felt very much like Alaska we have a Nissan down there I was thinking this feels kind of like America maybe somewhere near Grand Canyon in that region are these electrical poles American I am not sure there is a ro in the distance but it's too far to see I think I'll just go with my G it could be anywhere but let's see oh wow it was Saudi Arabia well this is a as I said this is a tricky map for sure here we have some Bengali writing here which would make me think either Bangladesh or India bunch of palm trees feeling very green very tropical maybe somewhere like near Kolkata I think it's a good good place for hedging bets let's see okay it was Bangladesh but I guess in this area for that very reason well in total only 7,300 points wasn't my best game but let's see how Chad GPT does okay let's begin let's begin with the first German location I'm just now realized that maybe this was meant as a Polish border post okay well in hindsight yeah I thought I wonder if AI will pick up on that the area is Lush with lots of green trees indicating a temperate climate the trees appear to be a mix of deciduous and coniferous common in Northern and Central Europe the house visible in one of the images is a traditional European design with a steep red tiled roof the road sign visible in the image is a red and white striped post which is typical of boundary markers found in Germany and Poland so it didn't pick up on the German marker but it picked up on that polish one the white van is a common type of vehicle seen in Europe okay so we're guessing Northern Poland okay it isn't that close to German border it did not pick up that it was the Border post just like a regular polish post so it one just guess right here let's see well it was still closer yeah to be fair my guess was super far but uh not as close as it could have been all right this location that was this was a rough one I included as much context as possible with all these trees and cliffs and whatnot but I doubt it will get it the images show striking Coastal Cliffs and clear blue water typical of tropical or subtropical coastal regions the lush green vegetation on the cliff suggest a warm climate with ample rainfall the type of rock formations and the way they erode suggest a volcanic origin which is common in many Island regions location in Caribbean South Pacific or other tropical island groups seems likely so it's thinking Caribbean Dominican Republic in particular well we already know it's not going to be correct well but it was a very tricky location I get whole three points on this round AI get zero oh I wonder if AI will get this one cuz cuz I thought Alaska was a good guess the landscape is dominated by snow covered mountains indicating a polar or subpolar region buildings have a utilitarian design common in research stations in remote and harsh environments the presence of a boat labeled with HMS suggests a British affiliation oh okay I'm learning some new things where did it say HMS though is it h stand for HMS the patrol sign on the boat also indicates a coastal or Maritime research station oh did it does it say Patrol here I didn't realize it said Patrol there the lighting conditions and Landscape are typical of places with extended daylight periods which could be in the Antarctic region given these Clues the location is likely a British research station in the Antarctic their overall setup and Landscape are reminiscent of the bases on South Georgia Islands such as King Edward point oh my God that's just crazy like it's basically a 5k the landscape is arid with sparse vegetation indicating a desert or semi- desert environment there are rugged mountains and Rocky outcrops typical of desert mountain ranges the presence of a utility pose and a vehicle suggest that this is not an entirely remote area and there is some level of infrastructure given the specific characteristics such as the type of mountains and the environment this location could be in Southwestern United States just where I was I just where I thought it was the Mojave desert in California or Nevada feels kind of weirdly reaffirming when the AI agrees with my wrong guess we're still both wrong but at least AI agreed somewhere somewhere right here well yeah not a good guess and the last round let's see maybe it say something helpful on that sign I mean I can't read it maybe Chad GPT can I'm not sure the signs are in Bengali indicating that this location is in Bangladesh or the Indian state of West Bengal the area is Lush and green with a lot of vegetation suggesting a tropical or subtropical climate the sign reads Bangladesh police clearly indicating that this is Bangladesh clearly if only I could read that given the Lush Greenery and institutional signage it appears to be in a rural area in Bangladesh The Mention Of bondar ban on the sign indicates that it is the bandar ban District a region known for its hilly Tran and beautiful landscapes in Southeastern Bangladesh maybe you should start learning Bengali well yeah it it was somewhere there well as expected chat GPT me here at least I won one of the three games so I'll take that as a win press that like and let me know in the comments how you did against the AI on the right side there will be another playalong video I think you will enjoy and big big thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this

forts of the world and we'll try to guess them looking at them from above to play along you need to have a satellite view script installed if you don't know how to do it I'll leave an info card up there the play along links will be in the description you can play along for free as always let's set the time and good luck to everyone good luck to everyone let's see what's our first location with castles and forite imagine we'll get a lot of coastal locations probably um that's that's what I would expect what do we have here um we have is this Rio I think in in the previous satellite view video we had we had an island like this where I said oh I can't remember Rio having an island here I think it was a re it was Rio so let's see do I remember correctly um um is that the one it certainly looks similar I think it is the one and we have a bridge yeah it is Rio okay what kind of a castle do we have here I'm not even sure or a fort maybe what is that is that a castle or a fort what let's see what what is that okay where where was it we have here IL IL what is that youal so we're like here okay interesting I will leave like an little info panel with a picture and then some information let me know in the comments what you think about this addition if you like it if you don't like it let me know so so I I can see if I should add those in the future as well all right what do we have here we have a some some small island here in the middle of a river with some old ruins it seems um okay um the Shadows seem to be going north so Northern Hemisphere because of that we have a bridge we have a city definitely feeling European maybe the roads are very gridlike but but not too gridlike not not like us levels so I think this would be Europe we have a small football field here oh what is this is this like a toll road or is this a border checkpoint wait we have a wait wait wait wait wait we have American style trucks and we have a yellow middle line so I'm starting to think this is not Europe after all so maybe it is US grid indeed oh we have three baseball fields okay yeah this is not your four or five baseball fields okay definitely at Europe um six another baseball field wherever this is they love baseball so somewhere in the US of a um and another baseball field well and and two more oh my God uh okay let's have a look at the some more stadiums gold backs new Newberg Newberg gold backs I don't know where Newberg is should I I I don't think I know I don't think it's a big place otherwise I feel like I would have heard of it at least Newberg well this doesn't look like a big city there is an airport here though so that's that's there with two runways a pretty big river Crusade [Music] ERS Crusaders so we have Newberg something and [Music] Crusaders doesn't help much though very green little bit hilly where would the river like this go this this wouldn't be Mississippi would it no there are no mountains like that here I feel there are some Rivers maybe here what is this one Savanah river Savannah River looks different with all those little nooks and crannies I don't know what's the proper term finding a river in the US is like looking for a needle in a Hast stack I feel how am I ever supposed to find this oh this is pretty like going from Summer to fall wow very nice transition it doesn't help us though but but uh very pretty Dukes well the best idea I have is to just go around like follow some rivers and see if I can spot Newberg somewhere I mean this could be Canada as well potentially I haven't really looked at Canada but I mean it is a possibility as well why not I haven't seen any new Bergs anything that would fit maybe keep it somewhere in this region but yeah well this is yeah I don't know how how how to find this let's see it was more south it was more south actually not too bad but uh oh Newber yep there it is New York Stewart oh there was a New York Stewart International Airport the one that we saw okay well we didn't see New York if we saw that that would have been very helpful that's for sure okay well I'll take that I'll take that ooh is this boss forus is it I think it is right I have learned from my mistakes last time I saw it I said it wasn't it now I'm saying it it is boss forus straight so it should be here yep yep yep yep yep and the castle castle here historic ottoman era Palace complex to topi sarayi Mesi okay very nice let's go okay from that very easy round we're once again something that looks way more tricky let's have a look at the palace SL Castle it is yeah well top of the top of the hill lots of dark roofs Shadows going north I would think this is Europe driving on the right side the quality is quite low though usually in Europe the satellite view quality is better than this which makes me a bit weary are we driving on the right side or are we driving left no I think we are driving right yeah definit definitely driving on the right side by judging by these Road lines so where would this be my first thought was like Slovenia maybe but because we have some hills I think the roofs might fit these dark roofs maybe so there is a river that goes through the city and splits in two basically there's like a big um Peninsula is that is that the name okay I mean let's let's check out Slovenia that was my first thought do we have a river like that though is there isn't a river well there is a very small river that goes through through lublana is there another city that this could be in Slovenia I actually don't think so so maybe this isn't Slovenia after all maribor no also wouldn't fit okay not not Slovenia then Croatia maybe maybe Austria instead I think Austria could work well let's have a look at some Austrian cities [Music] gr definitely definitely not Vienna Bratislava ever no an airport somewhere nearby I don't think so I don't see one at least definitely feels very European but I'm confused about going could this be Poland ever Southern Poland or something Germany maybe actually kind of liking Germany guess here but Germany Germany is pretty big so it would be tricky to find Ry River does it doesn't work it feels kind of similar though the way it flows it does feel very similar but none of these cities that I'm seeing this is a little bit similar but not really no oh oh we found it well I found it co cins cobbins I always thought it was a funny name because it's a security company in lvia which like qu Blends means something like what are you looking at so yeah funny name funny name but uh so we're looking for this Castle is this is this it or I think it might be Marksburg I don't see these broads but there are trees everywhere so it has to be yeah like heish Marksburg medieval castle and former prison of Ry okay pretty good 7 m good job good job okay this looks really difficult now how am I going to find this why is there a castle in the middle of literal nowhere what I don't see any castles here what I have questions which I hope I'll get answers to after the round but there's there's nothing here like there okay we have some mountains okay some pretty high mountains it seems so we have shadows going apparently to the north it seems as well so we would be in the northern hemisphere I don't see any signs of well okay I do see some signs of civilization there are roads and there are some houses with Red Roofs well wherever this is this feels very North very Northern so either Canada or salard or something even not entirely sure there are mountains let's check swal bir swal bar maybe we have this shape in very interesting shape so if we spot it maybe we can use it maybe not this is going to be tough I don't think this is SW bird the houses feel more North American I would say so how would I find this in Canada or or us ever Greenland ever maybe I feel like it might be one of these islands here potentially but how would I find it and is it even here I don't have a clue yeah like I I don't know like all these islands look the same at this point I've been looking at them for like 5 minutes at least so let's let's plun it somewhere here and and and see is it somewhere there it was Iceland after all wow interesting I was actually not considering Iceland which I admittedly should have but but but for some reason I was thinking Greenland Canada okay well that was that was a big Overlook cuz I feel like I if I was checking Iceland maybe I could have spotted it maybe not though after afterwards after the round everyone's smart um 19,900 well let's let's play another game and uh see if I can beat it oh I didn't check the castle in the previous one wait let's quickly have a look what what Castle was it like there was nothing there Bor borgar okay well as I I I'll leave a little info information about the the castle um so I I'm interested to find out more about it myself all right this this looks like a much bigger place than the previous round no water in sight though there is a small small River going through this place and the quality is really really good it seems uh and and it also looks like Europe with good quality and looking like Europe well it's probably Europe you have a football field or or soccer field for my American viewers we have a roundabout what does it say Graz gra gr what do it say GR in every corner do all the roads lead to Grass gr what is it what is does gr mean something does gr mean like slow or or is this just like the the roundabout of grass so everything says GR there I mean it could be is it is it actually Graz I mean there is a small River going through grz does it align well I think it does actually it's such a weird roundabout why does a roundabout in Graz say Graz like 20 times okay what what is that castle okay certainly looks like a cool castle from above at least let's see so it's like on the western side of the city one one good thing about this these Castle this Castle map is that well it's pretty easy to find a castle pretty easy to pinpoint once you have like figured out where it is so this is schoss egenberg palace with a grand Barack and roore rooms so it should be right here nice let's go let's go next location [Music] um okay well certainly a smaller place feel like this will be tricky to find what's with the castle here well I'm guessing it's somewhere like this this complex okay well is this Europe the roofs could be European for sure we have all white Road lines we are driving on the right side definitely and the Shadows are going to the north so I think Europe is a solid guess here now where in Europe would this be is the big question now I don't know I don't have a really good idea I'm thinking maybe something like Romania Bulgaria maybe looking at the rofes looking at the like like the everything little some small mountains here all around some bigger mountains here it seems so maybe like Bulgaria I don't know how would I ever pinpoint this though there there are no like rivers or other easy to spot unique features that would help me to align things so I think I might just need to pong somewh where I would love to make sure I know the country first though I don't know where this is some Snowy Mountains I think U like Bulgaria would be my best guess here and my confidence level is not too high so some high mountains maybe near Sophia somewhere here I I I don't I won't try to pinpoint this one cuz I think it's just too improbable I'm kind of starting to lean more towards Romania maybe with these mountains so I think maybe let's just get somewhere here in Romania and hope for the best it was Austria oo I was not considering Austria there [Music] if you know how I could have known it was Austria let me know in the comments and press that like button if you're enjoying the S videoos so I know to make more of them and oh is this Malta this is the the most typical Malta I've ever seen just like the shape of the island looks exactly like Malta and there should be Veta right there oh is this that really cool Fortress that's that's in valeta for St Angelo is that that the one yeah looks really really cool you'll see it in the in the info card not not info card but like the info tool tip um that I'll I'll I'll try to make let's see okay that was a nice and quick we're getting an easy one super difficult one easy one super difficult one like back and forth now this is again super difficult one I feel at least there is a river this time so I can try to find it maybe but so this is the castle Shadows are very Central slightly to the north slightly to the north I was thinking would this be Brazil or something or maybe not we have an American style truck here and a very good quality coverage so is that is that is a yellow middle line for sure looks yellow to me so what would this be with such a good quality I would be inclined to go us actually so I mean you can see how good of a quality this this is RR look it's railroad it means right I think this RR sign is in In Like Us Canada I don't think you would see RR in Brazil for example I don't think so so I think this would be us I think this would be us question is where where well yeah that's that's the whole point of the video where with such a big river on where would this be and like the cities that we have there like quite small nothing super massive lots of private homes here would this be New Orleans somewhere near New Orleans maybe let's uh let's see there are big Waters here but it doesn't look like that would Al line oh it's not in New Orleans I feel like it would be in the this area though I'm just getting those vibes that we don't have any Bridges nothing like that over the river here h a small airport very small only one Runway don't see anything helpful here only like small airplanes here as well nothing international well either their Compass is not entirely right or our Compass isn't entirely right so cuz the north should be straight like up that that's how it should be like this Compass is showing it's north straight up so one of the compasses are slight is slightly misaligned there seem to be lots of like like this is probably some interstate going here would be cool to know the number wait is it actually no way oh my God I actually found it I kind of had lost my hope honestly but I think it Alli were uh like actually Alliance right next to the amazing city with the amazing name Newport News such a great name for a city but uh we would be down here oh Bacon's C Castle Bacon's Castle well okay well V Virginia's oldest house built in [Music] 1665 wow that indeed is an old house all right good guess ooh okay well looks very dry and mountainous and Coastal so so with the coast to our South okay the Shadows are going to the north right slightly slightly to the north and here is the Fortress pretty big one a pretty big fortress now where would this be so dry well could would this be pain southern coast of Spain never this definitely feels like Mediterranean Europe to me we are driving on the right side here yeah Shadows are to the north we have a nice pool we have a football field with letters UD doesn't help me maybe if you're a big football fan maybe it helps but um yeah I don't know well let's have a look if it aligns with the Spain or not cuz I was thinking it might be somewhere here oh aliria kind of works oh and are these oh these are the the green houses right oh I should have realized it yeah in southern Spain there are a lot of these green houses very very interesting site where they grow all the tomatoes and another all all the other fruits and veggies so it's really a fascinating site should have realized that before okay but yeah like okay I I'll I'll I'm glad I did realize it eventually so okay we are in aliria and where would we so we're looking for this Fortress right so is this this is the Fortress so many so many different names which one is the name of the Fortress I'm guessing this one conun Monumental de alazab Alia Fortress complex from the 10th Century that's an old one so we are somewhere kind of there is nice let's go all right 22.7 th000 pretty

to be a little bit different recently I've noticed a lot of YouTubers making videos to fall asleep to uh so I thought let's make a video about geoguesser that some of you might want to use to fall asleep and if you're not tired if you're not going to sleep you can also play along the play along links will be in the description as usual and you can play along with a free account as well so in this video I'm going to try to keep editing as little as possible and uh yeah we're GNA play some popular Maps starting with the community world so let's go with that and let's keep the settings as usual minute and a half and no moving so good luck to us we have a long antenna starting with that these stickers feel kind of I'm getting maybe Nordic Vibes in a way but with mountains like these not sure not sure at all starting off with a pretty tricky one the houses feel Nordic I would probably go Norway I'm not sure if Norway has an antenna like this though I yeah not sure about that but just by The Vibes maybe Norway I'm not sure but let's let's go somewhere somewhere there it was Norway it was Norway indeed yeah okay good start The Vibes were on point there I'm glad about that what do we have here on this sign Bryson City Green smokeys Bryson I don't know where the where Bryson City is but we do have an American flag and some other flag maybe a state flag below but that's one of those blue flags that all look pretty much the same we have a Chinese buffet here here I no it doesn't say any state or anything there customers own yummy buffet sounds yummy indeed Cross Point we have front plates do we see any fronts of the car can't really see that one uh we don't have front plates here at least not on this car uh so where would I go a little bit Healy Bryson City well let's go maybe will there be any heals like this in Arkansas Tennessee Tennessee did did Tennessee have front plates or not was it maybe Alabama Alabama definitely didn't have front plates let's go somewhere there oh was it actually Tennessee oh no it was not Tennessee it was North Carolina close uh Tennessee okay well good uh good good good round I would say okay we have these kind of triangular looking poles here okay well where would this be triangular looking poles like this I'm thinking which Southeast Asian country could this be cuz this feels very much like southeast Asia to me but but what it be Indonesia I mean this feels very much like Indonesia but these poles don't feel particularly Indonesian to me these kind of triangular ones but H maybe just everything else is is giving me Indonesian Vibes I mean the motorcycle oh the blade okay it is a Black Blade isn't it and it looks like it might have three white sections which would correspond to this being Indonesia so I think I'm going to go Indonesia here despite not knowing the poles we have some hills some flatness a little bit I'm really not sure where in Indonesia this would be lombok let's go lombok oh no it was just Java it was Indonesia indeed and it was very Western Java B 10 all right oh we have a black car here we have a black car we have a big lake it seems with a black car like this I was thinking maybe Peru I know in Peru you can get some black car in Argentina you can get it as well this feels more Peruvian to me I would say can we spot any like signs or something here I don't think so so I think we'll have to go with the vibe I don't think the houses are helping much here so we have a lake to our kind of Southwest so not there can I find a leg that maybe could align [Music] wellwhere here there is a lake here I don't think this is it though but uh might as well keep it there oh oh it was this Lake okay but it was Peru not bad I'm pretty happy with my guesses thus far to be honest um ACA L [Music] something notal something naional we have a yellow middle line here we have some interesting colorful poles generation for what would this be is this Mexico or the polls feel a bit odd but maybe it is this language is Spanish I believe and I I don't think this would be Brazil anyways even without the language with Generation 4 where is the sun the sun is Sun is very high in the sky slightly to the north slight l h do I see any cars any plates not really I'm very much torn here I don't think this would be Mexico not with these colorful poles and the Sun to the north maybe something like Northern Peru or or oh there Argentina even wow okay yeah I wasn't thinking Argentina to be honest I was thinking like maybe Colombia Peru is the polls that wasn't really getting Mexican vibe there okay are those polls Argentinian maybe if you know let me know in the comments and press that like button as well if you are enjoying this video um okay let's do which map shall we do next let's do I Saw the Sign maybe two I saw the sign to again same settings minute and oh not single player though let's do it as a challenge so you can play along okay we do have a sign here indeed and we have some Italian ballards and Italian Italian signs CIA CIA mhm not sure what this sign is Casia this feels like more Northern Italy I would say Casia is there a chance that I can find it Casia I don't think I've heard of Casia before but I mean I could give it a try well at least I know it's definitely Italy with those narrow front plates and the ballards I do not see CIA anywhere though maybe it isn't as North as I thought or maybe it's small or maybe I'm just not noticing it C and we are running out of time well me and a half isn't too much time to find these place names if you don't know where it is yeah it it was more south there is Casia wasn't very big so it would have been tough to tough to spot but at least I did switch a little bit more south than initially thought welcome to Warman Warman well this would be us or Canada I'm feeling more Canada Vibes oh yeah we do have maximum sign here which would indicate Canada so Canada is verified oh man what was that flag I do not remember I should definitely refresh my Canadian province flag knowledge I used to know those flags but I have forgotten if you don't use them you forget them no signage permitted can have funny sign funny sign saying that no signs are allowed um where would this be in Canada Warman never heard of it looks quite flat this flag well that one is can Canadian flag this one I do not remember which annoys me to be honest cuz I know I should remember we do have a front plate at least on this car so one for Manitoba ever I think Manitoba should have front plate it is quite flat so I think I'm going to go with Manitoba it was Saskatchewan I don't think skatan should have front plates so it might have been um a car from out of province which obviously cars travel so kabupaten Ken is kabo men the name of the kabupaten I have not studied my kabo poten so that is my downfall here the telephone number is0 the code is 0287 am I mistaken thinking that 0287 was where is 0 2's job I have not refreshed my phone code knowledge in a very long time either same as with Canadian province Flags but I think 02 is where maybe maybe Java and I think it might fit well with the styled rules which you often see in Java as [Music] well K men kman kman well let's see if we can spot oh wait there it is just I want to say let's see if we can spot cable men and it's right there in the the middle of the screen okay well what's the road Direction almost vertical so we might be on this road do we see any roundabouts in the distance anywhere there is like a turn there so we're like here is oh never mind it was on a different Road thought was right we were near this road sarbini road but okay well I'll take that I'm very happy that I remembered the at least the phone numbers a little bit cuz though they can definitely be oh Kanye who doesn't know Kanye it's such a legendary place name in geog guesser same as same as Batman Okay Kanye Kanye is all the way here so Kane is to our East Kane is to our East what is this bus is that like a bus stop of Kanye to the right let's see if we can align this somehow the road is slightly like Northeast could we be here the road does turn in the distance I think this might actually be it do we have mongala mall somewhere here um doesn't look like it maybe this is an old coverage maybe there has been a new mall built there I'm not sure we can have a look if anything else aligns but this this one wouldn't align the road Direction doesn't fit here [Music] no this one no I think that intersection where I initially plunked fits the best let's see yeah it is there 5K let's go always nice to get a 5k we have some Danish signs here Road 12 vorg and herning I've definitely heard of a vorg can I spot it can I spot it now vorg Road 12 Road where is Road 12 alborg 11 13 where is Road 12 12 here hering is here I see oh and here is VOR perfect so we're somewhere in between 24 km in One Direction 23 in the other we're basically right in the middle so we might be in car are we here we are near okay okay yeah there is okay here okay on an intersection APO yep there is apch very nice nice and quick round breakdown 22.3 th000 not too bad the last two rounds I was very happy with and also round three okay and of course if you are play playing along let me know in the comments what are your scores uh next did that one let's do shall we the geod detective let's do geod detective it's it's similar to to I saw a sign so let's see good luck to us all now where is there should be also some Clues here there there's some sort of a fortress here is that a flag is that a Mexican flag I don't think we are in Mexico though we have an oh there must be an Italian flag just looked like there was something on that white so I thought it might be Mexico but no this is definitely Italy okay which Italian city would this be this feels quite Southern I would say looking at the architecture the palm trees feels feels quite Southern looks looks like we have the sea to our [Music] Southwest so could we be like Naples I don't think so uh marcala ever let's see can we spot any other Clues here now we have EU flag another Italian one H yeah I'm not sure where exactly this would be in Italy looks like a decently sized city oh oh boy let's shall we keep it in Naples okay well we runan out of time oh there it was taranto yeah makes sense but this kind of bridge here mhm okay that was a that was a good round I liked it even though I didn't find it now we have lots of green plates is what I notice and we have this um script so this should be um Bangladesh right lots of green green license plates which I have haven't noticed as much before in Bangladesh um would this be in daa my guess would probably be darker although maybe not this doesn't feel like such a big city if it isn't Daka I don't really have a good idea oh we have some some Bangladesh Flags here as well if if we still had any doubts I think still guessing daa is a safest option because it's right in the middle maybe it's like the outskirts of daa or something okay it was Sil hat oh I remember the good old times where in Sil hat there was that guy pushing the Google car which could be used as a meta but this was a new coverage so we didn't have that there must have been some signs because this is Geo detective but but I just didn't see mat mat where is mat certific where is this chikita we do have Ecuadorian uh um bards so this would be Ecuador mat is matay a big place in Ecuador or no I'm not sure I do not remember the name mat I don't see any Matas don't see any chikitas either here H not too bad that this sign is a bit too far to see cuz I'm sure there is there are some useful cities on that um sign yeah I don't see any mataya so unless I spot it last second I'll keep it somewhere oh oh oh mataya is on the very border wow I did not know that and It's tricky to F tricky spot as well but okay on driving on the right side we have a yellow license plade is the first thing I noticed so maybe Colombia let's see Carrera nii ni ni Oley City [Music] monia bunch of beaches okay well we do have lots of yellow my Google woke up for some reason um is this Colombia I think it would be um I think with so many yellow license splits and motorcycles um what are the cities nle ARB arboletes monteria monteria there is monteria but it's 1990 kilm to the north monteria arbot Telles do we see that nle is here oh okay we are oh turbo you did say Turbo here I didn't realize turbo is a city I thought it was some some car oil advertisement or something so we're on a road that goes like that it was a 5k after all let's go oh my gosh it it realized turbo was a place name but okay now I know we have what is this Ballard oh I feel like I've seen it before but in which country was it it was Peru I guess yeah we do have Peru some Peruvian signs we have a Peruvian uh flag is this a Peruvian border yeah Peru Brazil says welcome to Peru so Peruvian Brazilian border Peruvian B Brazilian border so which Peruvian Brazilian border has coverage is it like here maybe there is a bridge here I think we would be somewhere here no there's some sort of like a what is it thought it was a theme park but no I think it might be just a regular recreational area right here I think we are did it say 30C on this one it does say 30C yeah perfect it is Road 30C very nice another 5K I like these Maps they make me feel like I am very good um but yeah sometimes I'm yeah uh anyways 5,000 in last two rounds very good let's move on to the next map which one shall we do capitals might be too easy I feel let's do where is that McDonald's that's always a funny map only 74 locations but I haven't played it too that often that even if I do get any repeats then I don't think I will remember them this is unofficial coverage right off the bat spasen brunen be well that's certainly a McDonald's cappuccino Burger yeah the quality definitely could be better sovi we do have some German I was thinking that I'm seeing some Lind does it say Lind are we in Lind maybe let's see I mean that's as good of a guess as any Lind any McDonald in the city center that we spot um not noticing any this feels like oh wait McDonald's Lind andar yo oh my God I actually found it let's go good start Good Start well we have another McDonald's we have a double decker bus right there so this should be London Warren Street W1 Warren Street Station I don't know where it is I don't know where it is Warren Street Station Maple House Warren Street I mean I can do some scanning but I mean London is so huge doesn't this doesn't feel super Central Warren Street like there is a McDonald's here but that's not a Warren Street no any other clothes I mean London is already a decent decent guess but would have been nicer to find the exact spot but I don't think it will be a possibility Druid Street that's a cool name Warren Street yeah that's like looking in a for a needle in a Hast stack so many streets in [Music] London there it is y Warren Street wait there isn't even a street called Warren Street oh that tiny one is okay there's zero shot I would have found it I thought like we were looking for a beak street but no okay apparently not okay next one McDonald's we have McDonald's written with in cilic so that's already a good clue in itself Victoria Secret what is Victoria Secret no one knows some birthday is this Moscow looks like we have some some big Financial District in the distance so I'm thinking maybe must go yopi European Center or something here the plates the plates do not have the blue strip so it could work with with this being Moscow just general Vibes I feel Moscow would be a good fit here so I don't know if we can trust the compass cu the coverage is unofficial but I think I know that the financial district is kind of here I think it was somewhere here on the western side of Moscow for some reason I have that in my mind so we would be um I don't know somewhere I was considering switching to like here but okay not too bad all right now it's called fuska of course now another double decker bus but it's a tourist bus so this is not going to be London we are driving on the right side here we have blue strips lots of taxis coverage could be better oh we have some Greek Greek language there right there and and we have a Greek flag we're definitely in Greece where is the McDonald's huh maybe it has closed cuz I am not seeing any McDonald's in this coverage we see a Coca colola stand oh no there is McDonald's very well hidden behind the The Columns yeah not the best branding here it's really easy to miss uh anyways I'm guessing this would be Athens next to some big building and a big Square to our East and McDonald's is to our West um the road direction is like that no not there I don't think we'll find it but still this should be in Athens I think oh it was down here oh yep yep yep yeah that fits perfectly okay still a good score though o okay another unofficial one Ronald gym club kind of like these unofficial coverages as well cuz there are no metas no like copyright years to look at and stuff like that just pure guessing in a way although the quality is off of subar unfortunately we have a yis blue strip what does it say in interven interven I'm thinking could this be Slovenia maybe I'm not super sure but there are some mountains that houses feel like they could be um merar tour Center merart Center like the language feels like uh Slovenia could be Slovenian as well I always tell Slovenian language apart by the fact that it uses the same letters as as lvan like there are no letters in Slovenian that we don't use in lvan there's some extra letters in lvan that slovenians don't use but okay it was very um very south southern southwestern copper it was that was a tricky one well at least I got the country but yeah 246,000 pretty good pretty good not bad at all okay so we can close this uh let's go for a balanced world next how about that that could be a bit of a challenge but let's see how that goes I go I hope I have made all of these games play along I might have done some accidental single player games but hopefully not hopefully they all are play along okay yeah this is definitely a more tricky one most certainly [Music] um I I'm thinking maybe turkey I but I really don't know there's no antenna no car some Chevrons some black and yellow chevrons some whites and red Chevron different types of Chevrons here this be Russia but I'm not I don't think I've seen yellow and black shivon in Russia before but this is a difficult one I don't know I think I'll go turkey but my confidence level is low on this one oh my oh my it was [Music] Argentina yeah well that was not a good guess let's put it that way okay we have we're driving on the right side we have the I believe Russian uh license plates or are they are they Ukrainian they might be Ukrainian I think I kind of see yellow and blue on the left side and I was thinking is there a yellow and blue there as well so I'm thinking this might be Ukraine after all oh and I think this might be a red car as well are we these mountains all around us I would go Western Ukraine cuz Western Ukraine is more mountainous so let's go somewhere there okay not but oh very close to the Border see okay but um I'm happy with this guess now okay we have ballards we have Australian bards having on the left side here oh origion guessing Australia is something I'm definitely not good at quite a red soil here which is interesting I was thinking H what was I thinking I was thinking that I don't know um what did could it be would it be somewhere up here in Queensland a bit more maybe here I don't know is the so could the soil be that red there ah no it was more South it was near canara yeah that's a tricky one okay we have a white car here now would this be Malaysia or Indonesia I'm thinking Indonesia I'm thinking Indonesia looks quite flat what's with the houses have we have some Palms the houses [Music] H I have a bike very Rusty one H I'm not sure maybe it is Malaysia after all but let's go k monan oh no it was it was just Java huh oh okay I wasn't thinking Java now what is this we have a pool damn looks like a cool pool very cool pool two pools even some sort of a like a resort or spa or something where would this be this feels European I would say does it some palm trees some quite tropical looking trees what is this I'm really confused yeah B that balanced world does it to you it gets you really confused I feel like there are a lot of tricky locations there I'm not sure what to think here cuz the Flora doesn't feel that European could this be an island or something like um canaries I have no idea osaurus let's see oh who is Uruguay I wasn't think I wasn't even considering Uruguay oh yeah that was the definitely the trickiest game yet uh let's go for world cities next that could also be quite tricky average score is 2.7k 2700 So that's a very a very low average score let's if I can beat two points 7K I'll be happy I hope I can what is this this feels okay we have Poland definitely Polish language with this a letter with a little tail do we can we see the city somewhere maybe this might be one of one of these might be the city's Crest BR brw here we go I've actually been to V VZW I think that's how you say it um the road goes like this and this looks like a pretty big road so maybe here looks like a pretty big road that you Ed to get into the city what do we have on the other side we have some big house big buildings some we here like nitka maybe Melita do we have Melita somewhere Melita Melita don't see any melitus here no melitus it could be could it be maybe all the way here somewhere I don't know oh no never mind it was more in inside the city yeah no milit still but okay still a pretty good score we already beat the average for this map so let's go I wonder why is the average so low cuz this map doesn't feel that hard I'm sure there are some tricky locations but the ones the two that we've had let's just say ban right here maybe people are going Copenhagen the Flying Tiger is from Copenhagen the city should be ban here the signs are um Norwegian as well so let's go Bergen we have big mountains to our South West so would we be H I think we are on this side of the river but um I'm see I'm looking for if I can find the Flying Tiger somewhere what is the road road Direction like that I don't know oh all the way here oh is the Flying Tiger not there anymore oh no there it is yeah you really needed to zoom in to spot it okay still almost a five okay okay we have some Hebrew on this boss so we should be in Israel and uh ay ay would this be doesn't really feel like Tel Aviv to me I would expect to see some more palm trees and for it to feel more Coastal of for T Aviv so I'm thinking maybe this probably would be Jerusalem I would guess I also see some yellow license plates you see in Israel as well so yeah let's go I don't think I'll try to pinpoint this we have a straight road the road turns slightly East there so let's go somewhere here I don't know oh close though $ 4999 Voyage arcade Voyage arcade the Metro oh that's a cool mural is this us this feels like the US no look right oh it is look right look left oh it's a oneway street probably that's why is this us or is this like Australia or something which should okay the steering wheel is on the other side so this would be Australia I was thinking the the phone number doesn't really fit look American through to kavanau Street that's another cool mural and another one Aussie shop is it let a Aussie shop lots of really really cool murals in this area Curts cakes specialty cakes I'm sure Kur Kurt makes some great cakes um I do not know I was thinking maybe adelite I'm getting kind of adelade Vibes I don't know why I've never been to adade so I don't know oh well even though I got the country right it's as wrong as it could have been basically just like it was in Darwin how was there a way for me to know it was Darwin look let me know in the comments if you spotted any Darwin clues that could have helped I don't think it said Darwin anywhere maybe there were some unique signs to Darwin or something test Centrum dorf well that helps I think this could be dorf [Applause] maruyasu um um yeah let's let's just go to sorf somewhere there H okay well this definitely doesn't feel like a city center we have some sort of like a big water tower or or like a TV tower up here to our Northeast aroden did it say aroden somewhere here or am I tripping I might be tripping kof can we find K somewhere or say say Hof or something oh yeah no not going to find it not going to find it oh there it is Toof and K okay K is Tiny okay well still 4993 pretty good way better than the map average 20.6k I will take that okay let's move on extraordinary World by aloc also a great map also a great map Let's uh let's play it let's go in extraordinary world you basically get amazing views both official and unofficial coverage so yeah just play and enjoy the beautiful world we have yellow license split here this is a pretty difficult map definitely CU could be anywhere unofficial mostly should be really good quality as well even if it's unofficial so yeah this is definitely a cool map to play has been around for a very long time as well and Al keeps updating it um okay we have a steering wheel on the opposite side so we would be driving on the left side here H I am really not sure where this would be drawing on the left side looking like this I'm thinking maybe Namibia or something could it be sun I mean the sun is to the north I'm not sure if you can trust Compass here or not let's go namia maybe no no good clue I'm not sure if Namibia uses yellow F and splits or not it was Namibia okay nice I'm very happy with this guess I maybe is actually such a big country when you think about it indeed even bigger than Botswana all right I think official coverage is coming to Namibia right I'm pretty sure I heard that so it's going to be really really cool once that happens the more new countries get some official coverage the better what country would you wish to get the official coverage let me know in the comments I would love to hear your thoughts me personally I'm excited about Namibia getting coverage um would be cool to maybe get something like uh [Music] Nepal some more coverage there maybe some more African countries as well like DRC that's another Big Country well there isn't too much to see here really just like a small Mountain Run This is an official official coverage this feels like maybe an island a mountainous Island maybe this is going to be rough I could see this see this being maybe new Zealand I'm thinking maybe something like aor or or canaries but really I don't know maybe Hawaii even it was New Zealand okay well it was one of my options all right but uh yeah well I didn't go with the correct option unfortunately there we have another very very beautiful location very Rocky lots of rocks all [Music] around could this be somewhere like Armenia Georgia maybe maybe not but I don't know that that was the first thing that came to my mind I've been to Georgia it looked a little bit similar there maybe not exactly like this but a little so I was thinking maybe Armenia or something nearby maybe I mean sometimes you just got to go with your G may be super wrong though well it was it was Andora was it yeah it was Andora wow I wasn't thinking Andora there I thought Andora was more green and Lous but I guess some parts are not as green and L ious but still beautiful though okay we have some more big mountains unofficial [Music] coverage I don't really know this is a very tricky one is that like a fence a barb wire fence here [Music] H I don't even know the continent here I'm thinking maybe somewhere in [Music] California maybe could be Europe kind of feeling more California though but somewhere in these these national forests nope okay it was the US it wasn't California it was Colorado but I'll take that I'm happy after the previous few rounds I'm very happy with this guess okay we have some sand dunes this almost feels kind of lvan to be honest this is official uhhuh this is official where is the sun the sun is through the South well I don't think this is actually lvia I was thinking maybe Lithuania ever I know there are some weird sand dunes in Japan but I don't think this is Japan I don't think this feels more European this feels so Baltic to me I mean of course I might be wrong but but but but but I'm thinking maybe like Lithuania Poland somewhere in this area maybe okay nice okay it was this this part of Lithuania that makes perfect sense okay I'm very happy with this guess 11.7 th000 what's the average for Extraordinary World 7.6 okay I did get above average so I'll take that and but yeah extraordinary world is a tricky map to play for sure but also very interesting and beautiful in my opinion um well the next map is a learning world but well that's my map so we're not going to play it now but if you're looking for some good training locations practicing metas getting better geaser that's the map to go let's do AI generated world that's the next one let's go for this one a wise mix of computer generated and handpicked locations [Music] at20 okay all officially covered countries well let's go let's go what do we have here this this this Pole looks kind of Polish I think with these holes not going all the way to the ground or are they or are they going all the way to the ground this feels like PA very much I think and Southern Poland maybe cuz I feel like Hungarian Hungarian um polls look a bit different I I would definitely go Poland here so let's go maybe Southeast somewhere here okay it wasn't as East but it was South yeah okay nice we have first that was Bulgaria but let's see we have a long antenna here long long antenna H let's see very flat not sure about the antennas which countries have long antennas which countries have short antennas I don't remember all of that stuff could I am not sure this is like a fall coverage where is the spring oh this is fall almost feels like Poland but I don't think it has coverage like this does it so let's go with should I just go Romania Bulgaria let's go somewhere there oh that's why it felt so much like Poland to me okay that makes sense didn't consider it oh we have a big hole in the road any antennas nope no antennas at all this feels like a very tricky map as well at least to me I have some of these uh poles with concrete blocks next to them sometimes see that in lvia as well but this is dead definitely not lvia I think this would be Russia would be my guess but where but where but where very small trees feels like it might be North somewhere I don't know let's go somewhere northish even more North okay it did feel North just didn't know it was there North or here North or or or where North but yeah it was north um hotel resort hotel be part of us what is this this is we have an antenna like that Ding the right side this would be Nigeria yeah we have a follow car greenish plate no parking so does this say the city somewhere oh it says Nigeria here even International egg egg May egg may I don't see any cities I don't think any this definitely feels kind of Northern to me no looks squ dry mountainous spiritual healing business success marriage success love passion back to sender what is that well the the they definitely offer lots of services let's go Zaria cono maybe cono let's go somewhere there oh no oh never mind ubwa wasn't nearly as North as I thought okay what is this okay this is uh these are some Argentinian Road numbers Road number 40 feel like that's one of the longest if not the longest road in Argentina it goes all the way from up here all the way to to like south of Argentina the road 40 isn't super help so but this is Road 40 all right this what does this feel like this feels like let's go maybe somewhere near zapala no it was way more North after R yeah [Music] 159,000 could have wished for a better better result but was okay okay and let's do pinpoint a world now the next one let's go here we have European Union flag we have a Portuguese flag Santa Clara Pon the Santa Clara so Sant CLA bridge I don't know where it is though Santa Clara Bridge some Stadium there oasas oras [Music] puas would this be Pon the Arab no no it doesn't say the city there does it like orra isn't a city is it it's not lisban it's not we have water we have a bridge H we're not on the very Coast coimbra ever I don't know it's not there I don't know where this is wait it was actually here oh I was so close Okay the I got the direction of the bridge a little bit wrong I thought it was more like this so I wasn't looking at this bridge even okay well still not bad actually what is this uh we have Ireland here kileny is to our South I know where kileny is cuz the name is so funny so we have that there n426 do we have that somewhere here n78 and 78 is here n426 is here so are we here we have a road that turns like that that is 694 yep yeah I think we're in this intersection here nice nice 5K well this is a a really cool map a pinpoint double World also similar to those those Maps we played before newa Australia NOA I'll be honest I don't know where NOA is in Australia NOA gold bananas Beach sorry Beach wear for kids well Australia has a lot of beaches so it's not super helpful live life well okay let's try to find NOA maybe if we do a quick scan we have Mario no yamb NOA heads is that it NOA I'm not sure if that's the right NOA but I found some no P Pina I guess let's go somewhere here NOA what's the direction like that a it was up there okay he I'll I'll take it not bad we have some Hong Kong yeah it is it says Hong Kong there we have Chinese we have English Hong Kong Sport Institute driving left we are on a bridge okay lot oh my God so many high Heist buildings here that's crazy that is kind of crazy so wait let's let's zoom into Hong Kong so we are on a bridge which one oh that's a tunnel that's not a bridge that ain't no bridge is are we on this bridge no I don't think so are we on that's not a bridge that's a tunnel where is a bridge that would fit here this one no here maybe is there a coverage there maybe there um but we I don't see an airport here though I don't think that's it where was it oh it was I overlooked this yeah this this this fit perfectly Ah that's yeah little bit silly totally overlooked it what do we have we have some Italian here no info point jenti auu is J GTI a place name jenti jti this feels quite Southern again with water to kind of east south uh west southwest jenti okay let's see if we can spot some jenti or something [Music] not really seeing any jantes here anything here maybe no oh well I guess we won't 5K this one well it's definitely Italy though so let's go somewhere here is it was okay it [Music] wasn't it was not the city name okay oh well how did we do 23.7 th000 points not too bad well that was a lot of play along games I hope you enjoyed it and uh yeah thank you for watching if you uh want to play some more playalong games the link there will be another video on the right side of the screen which I think you will enjoy and of course as always huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTu members for supporting this Channel and make it making it all possible I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/PfswpHe3DvKcJU7Z",

the European championships going on I'm thought let's play some European football stadiums map because I think it's very fitting for the occasion so yeah I'll be upfront I'm not the biggest football expert I just like to watch from time to time but I think it still could be fun to play this map and see how we do and of course if you want to play along the links will be in the description you can play with a free account as well and and yeah don't forget to press that like button if you enjoy these play along videos so let's go so what is this okay well we are certainly in a football stadium and this is all should be in Europe team talk bet way bet way I'm looking for okay I mean I was looking for some Clues and I think a pretty good clue is a text saying this is London Stadium can't get any any more direct than that this this is London Stadium okay welcome to West Ham United uh well we would be in London I imagine West Ham United where would be West Ham well somewhere in the west maybe I am not sure Holland no Holland Park is an actual Park in English it's confusing sometimes you call stadiums Parks which I can never tell which one is an actual Park and which one is a stadium London is a massive City but uh let's go Wembley well this isn't Wembley but uh all right it was the other side of London London Stadium well yeah it indeed was but overall a pretty good start I would say um I'm hoping I'm not sure what what score am I hoping for like 20K 20,000 points would be amazing I don't think I'll get 20,000 points arus I know where arus is are we in arus arhus in is in Denmark so that DK yeah checks out checks out yeah I think we can head to arus right here where is there a stadium here that might be the challenge to find the stadium if you don't know where it is is this a stadium no oh wait there's Frederick's B berer fredb Stadium stadion maybe that one um this doesn't look like a super massive one looks like a mediumsized stadium I would say so maybe that one let's see oh it was a bit more south oh okay there it was it wasn't even green on the map so a tricky one but okay um a good one though good one since we got the city in oh no n ntfc something something Football Club New Times oh gosh the quality is terrible oh boy I there's no chance we uh we can read any texts here so might need to go by The Vibes the architecture and whatnot well certainly looks like a Europe well that's a given ntfc sky but uh lee Warren Jackson would this be UK I mean UK football is massive in UK so the architecture wasn't giving me UK Vibes at least not these buildings that we see here Germany maybe uh I'm not sure I am not sure no let's go south southern UK because of these Lee Warren and and whatnot somewhere okay it was UK okay Lee Warren saved me on this one thank you Lee Warren whoever you and round number four we have cilic bero bero bero I don't know what that is bero B well my first thought was Bulgaria maybe because it starts with B I mean bellus starts with b as well will this be bellus I don't think so I think the the buildings and feels more Bulgarian we have some mountains right next to the city so could this be sopia we have mountains kind of towards the south of Sophia there are some mountains to the north of sopia I mean there are some hills all around well some smaller ones in that direction but um could this be Sophia or are the mountains near Sophia higher not sure these might be too too low but I think Sophia might be my best guess on this one b B I think I think ber might be the city name after all ber it's not sopia I don't know where the city of beroya is though I am not sure might not be Bulgaria after all no it was Bulgaria oh it wasn't it wasn't the city name I guess maybe they're just F such fans of B the roundabout has its name even okay it was the stara Zagora the city yeah the mountains there are not as high I imagine the Sophia ones are higher than that puera ticket office what is this team ibita well ibita is in Spain puera sounds maybe Spanish indeed toas I well I guess let's oh my God so cute I guess let's go to Spain then the plates I mean the the landscape the trees nature just feels Spanish as well so I think it works where would be there a I mean there is a stadium right here is that the one we can maybe try to align let's switch the compass I prefer the classic Compass but but I know a lot of people play with the new one as well the stadium is kind of to our South would we be here oh yeah IAS that's the one that's the one so we would be right here in front of that ticket office let's go I'm happy with that uh least one 5K and the goal has has been reached 22,000 actually much better than I thought I would do in this map to be honest let's do another game let's do another game Let's keep going with these European football stadiums uh rcd espanol well I'm guessing Spain again with espanol vishi Catalan okay Catalan so we would be in Catalonia I guess so maybe Barcelona potentially La Liga rcd rcd Espanola is the team name but um rcd there was a B in the name I would definitely go Barcelona but rcd I think I still might go Barcelona to be honest football is big in Spain as well so this makes perfect sense to me there is some Stadium here that fits I don't think so I think the stadium looks different than the one we have but this is as good of I guess as any let's switch I switched last second oh there is a stadium it doesn't even show up from the distance how am I supposed to find that like if you zoom in close enough it does say Stadium but like but still good guess though close close no this Stadium doesn't look as modern as the previous one BP r b b ponzoni sounds kind of Italian ponzoni maybe I don't know um whatever wherever this is this seems like a pretty small stadium um would this be Italy would this be Spain again I am not super sure Dior I mean also in Italy football is Big so Italy is also a very good option well even the football isn't big somewhere they they still will have some stadiums right in because of the language that I see here I'm thinking maybe Italy but where in Italy I wouldn't have a slightest clue let's go Florence maybe surely there are some football stadiums there as well uh I don't know where though I don't see any from the first glance let's just plun it somewhere oh not bad actually it was close to Florence Modena it was okay okay still I'm I'm very happy with that guys what is this Fritz wall wter St stadion 1 fck kenberg where is this the language looks German something swagen partner F imal what is swagen swagen I don't know what it is but it looks funny swagon carlburg vun I feel this is definitely Germany but but I'm trying to figure out maybe it says like the city somewhere vka gorbachov yeah deutche as well so definitely german. de yeah if we needed some more verification do you football. de I do not really I like football playing football but I haven't played football for I don't know like at least 10 years um Frankfurt I don't know honestly no idea where this would be 1 fck bettenberg guessing that might be the city name but I've never heard of bets andberg in my life oh okay another honestly I lucky guess I had no idea which German City it was it was kelon oh bettenberg is like a neighborhood here okay cool cool cool round number four now looks like a lot of texts looks like a pretty big outdoor stadium Maybe just the angle makes it look big okay what's the text here enus well that looks Spanish doesn't it I don't speak Spanish but I think it looks Spanish and the y letter was in Spanish right not in Portuguese I think like like a separate why Genova that's some sort of an ad Genova ad I don't think this is Genova though don't know let's guess Zaragoza I I hope it's Spain it should be Spain it is Spain oh it was mad just mad Madrid outskirts of Madrid yeah well couldn't find any CD Clues there well first the first thing I notice is the yellow back plate which would make me think ukuk right off the bat um is this the stadium East stand so we see the outside of the stadium this time we have this black cab okay okay Black Cab do they have black cabs all over UK or just in London is that a thing actually I'm I think it's London right let me know in the comments if you if you are from the UK I think it's a London thing not like a whole UK thing I can't can't remember seeing any black CS in like Scotland but maybe maybe I just didn't notice um so the black cap would make me think London I do not recognize the stadium itself but looks a pretty looks like a pretty big one I imagine it might say the Stadium's name potentially there but it's just the quality is too bad to read it so let's go London let's go would this be I don't think this is wamble is it but might as well guess it I guess let's see oh okay well that answers my question it's not only a London thing you can get them in Manchester as well appar currently Old Trafford oh I've heard of Old Trafford I have heard of Old Trafford before how did we do not as good as the first game 19,000 but I think we can go for another quick one so let's go make it a challenge what is this the Rams Derby durwent Valley Construction LTD LTD would make me think UK Ram the Gordon guy Guri stand oh we have an English flag the Rams in Southampton well since we have an English flag I would think this might be England uh wild guess I don't know where the Rams are based though Sheffield shall we go Sheffield let's go Sheffield I mean the opponents are from Southampton so maybe we should go closer to Southampton Birmingham let's go maybe Birmingham let's see oh there's oh the Derby is a place name oh honestly I could have could have noticed it cuz it was large enough to notice well just didn't didn't occur to me the Derby was a place name oh wait we this is a repeat we just had this this was in Italy right yes and it was Ian I went with Florence it was slightly North Moda Moda it was and I think it was this Stadium no not a perfect score oh I shouldn't have guessed in the middle of the stadium honestly but okay 4999 is also a good one oh okay we're looking from above does it say berau my first thought was that it says berau it kind of looks like like it does so would this be berau well I think it does say berau so the city looks like the larger I guess yeah since this is an official coverage we can't really trust the compass necessarily but looks like we are like towards one side of the city the city center is so let's go so that is the city center that we have and we would be I don't know how would we figure this one out can we TR if we can trust the compass there are more Hills on our side which side is more heilly can we tell this side looks more Heil is this a stadium what did it say here FC zova there is like a football stadium here but I don't think it's it I think it's too close to the city ah there it is there it is okay so that was the one okay not too bad though we got the city very easily we have monteer mediterran Metropolis something what is happening here oh that's a camera oh okay photo number 10 well this would be um France right monteer was down here yeah that's that's what I thought was it say monteer there as well uh not a big turnout for this game I'll be honest most of the seats are empty so probably not a very um exciting match where is there a stadium here is that a stadium that's a stadium so let's guess somewhere there oh nice it actually was and a 5k let's go we have uh I thought it was a flag but not really at least not a flag and Zeno what is happening here oh my Lord oh my God why why why does this exist it says Genova again IL buk the language looks Italian to me Indonesia no this is not Indonesia Malta what Indonesia Malta what is this the language I thought the language was Italian bucato sounds Italian I am very much not confident Libera liberta I I don't know I honestly have no idea let's go Milan oh it was Genoa I didn't trust it I I should have gone Genoa oh that was silly there were so many so many names so many places that but still 234,000 I'll take that uh if you played along let me know in the comments how you did press that like button for more play long videos and on the right side there will be another one I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/60Ud5ORQK4XGfSRI",

what are some popular Maps right now and I saw basic metas a pretty popular map made by Mery and I thought I mean I should know them all but maybe there are some new metas that I don't know admittedly I haven't been keeping up with all the new stuff coming out so let's try it out maybe I can learn something maybe I can teach you something so let's see let's have some play along games and yeah the challenge links the play along links will be in the description you can play along even with the free account as always Let's do let's do no moving and let's set a time limit to minute and a half well these should be easier rounds but let's see so there will be like bards Flags Google cars follow cars camera Generations lots of different things so here we have what I believe is a Welsh flag so um yeah I know that so let's go whales um is there a is there a point of trying to I guess let's try to guess as close as possible I don't think I'll find anything much Cyra is that the city name yeah I don't see a city with that name but uh this doesn't feel like a big city so I don't think this would be like a neighborhood in Cardiff let's go near Cardiff though somewhere here ah it was aberon apparently okay what's the next meta Doo Dominican Republic I guess well you you don't often see Dominican Republic's domain name so that's why where that confused me a bit the big thing in Dominican Republic is the Google car with these black bars um so yeah that would be Dominican Republic in Dominican Republic the coverage is in two cities Santiago deos caberos and Santo Domingo I always forget how to tell them apart I I like you can tell them apart with these polls but I always forget which one is which so let's go I want to go Santo Domingo okay yeah cool um yeah but I wasn't sure that would be Taiwan the Flag taipe City Hall well let's go typ a city well as expected quite quit qu easy rounds this car is Bangladesh although there is a different coverage new coverage as well this is like the old Bangladesh car that you can see but but there is plenty of coverage without this car visible as well so uh don't take it for granted this is on Doran flag I believe we have some Spanish yeah definitely looks very much like this architecture these kind of brownish bricks I feel like are very very very andoran you can definitely they definitely feel unique I believe to me at least let's go somewhere there well not bad not bad I expect a lot of good results I hope no game will be under 20K I hope let's see let's keep going let's go I feel there will be a lot of play along um links in the description just cuz uh how quickly these games are going these short dashes are the clue here I believe and of course bards um the short dashes are very common in uh Sweden and the bards would also fit with Sweden how nor how far north would I guess here doesn't feel too North I don't think okay yeah not bad this car is is it reunion yes it is okay uh cuz cuz with reunion you don't well at least I don't usually tell the car apart by the front you usually look at the tape cuz in Ghana the tape will be on the front bar in reunion it will be on the behind bar the back bar so yeah but but yeah the car definitely looked like reunion reunion of course is right here let's go let's go uh these are British ballards although you can see them in Indonesia at least very very similar ones I think they look the same but quite rarely though but this this would be UK uh we driving on the left side the car is definitely look European this would definitely be the United Kingdom where in the UK I'm not so sure I would h a little bit Healy but not too hilly where would that be is England hilly somewhere I'm thinking England but I'm not sure in which parts England is most Hil let's go somewhere near Wales okay yeah not bad 60 what is this 60 well the 60 feels Australian but I'm feeling this hint might be territory specific which Australian territory could this be I used to know this one day let's look around what can we find Brisbane is 96 Brisbane is to the South Pacific Motorway what does it say here Gold Coast city council well Gold Coast Gold Coast is indeed near Brisbane so good to know these these bigger cities not only in Australia in in general all over the world cuz big big city names do pay off to know uh but yeah I guess this is but correct me if I'm wrong in the comments but I guess this would be the Queensland sign with these these uh like looking like this with the screws like that and and everything okay 96 where it would be 96 I don't see 96 99 97 so 98 before but I don't see 96 well surely it's somewhere there okay A bit more North this black car um this feels like Malaysia I think um you can definitely see black car in other countries as well but just but with the with the roundings with these oil Palms up here feels very Malaysian let's see not too many other Clues oh we do I totally missed that we have the black sticker black plate on the pole which would be Mainland Malaysia but yeah in general this this these palm trees I would have gone Mainland Malaysia I believe I think felt like that to me nice okay also good score nothing nothing surprising but good Clues definitely if you are starting the game if you're looking for a good map I have a also a similar map called a learning world I will also leave it in the description uh you can also use that to practice cuz also a lot of uh like metas useful tips General Landscapes that that you can use to get better at the game uh there uh the flag would be Peruvian here so I would go Peru um scope Usha Bank in Peru interesting I don't think I had seen that before univ Mar Mala Del Peru Mala I don't know what that is Fort some some Fort well this would be Coastal with a fort like this I imagine would this just be Lima let's just go Lima I'm not sure let's see it was just Lima yeah it was quite Coastal indeed oh these poles these poles you can see poles like these in uh like very similar poles in quite a few countries these triangular uh poles lattery poles with these these horizontal sections this would be in Nigeria I believe cuz with the side of my eye I think I saw the follow card there yeah um but you can see similar polls in Brazil and Portugal so definitely use context clues as well we have greenish plates here you can see those in Nigeria this follow car H in which regions was it you can use the follow cars to kind of guess the regions in Nigeria um was this one the one that was kind of Southern oh it was more East yeah um that uy euru of course of course uh let's just get the capital I guess Mont videoo nice the flag is Malta let's guess Veta nice now this black car would be either Argentina or Uruguay um with these Road lines this yellow with um with white stripes also you see that in Argentina Uruguay uh this Boward these bards that we see here those are Uruguayan bards you don't see them too often but uh that's one of those things that can tell help you tell Uruguay and Argentina apart so I think it's worth knowing cuz otherwise it can be sometimes tricky to tell the two apart I think in the distance we can see the Uruguayan signs as well they're kind of thicker white I believe wooden uh sign post so yeah we go Uruguay here very nice okay this one was the worst one in terms of points but some very good Clues very good tips I believe definitely good ones for uh that's a Singaporean flag we're getting lots of flags oh zooming in on the wrong place uh but yeah definitely knowing Flags in geoguesser does pay off it's worth it also Google cars for sure uh this is the Uganda new Google car and we go Cala for that uh this would be wait what what was what were we focusing on oh I don't have the well let's refresh it then the timer should still keep going um what was the clue here I'm not entirely sure what's that's what's the clue um if if you know let me know in the comments maybe just The Vibes just the general gist of it is this definitely feels like Southern Africa and uh we have the yellow outer lines maybe that was it cuz you can kind of see yellow OU lines surely there would be better examples for that but we have yellow our Line's white middle line that's very common in southern Africa we have a white car that's that's also in the the the southern African countries we have some long grass here long grass very little though but some and some green forests I would go eswatini here I'm not 100% sure but we do have okay we do have more long grass in the distance I feel like longrass is more common in eswatini than than elsewhere let's go eswatini I wouldn't be surprised about luru though to be honest it was eswatini okay cool cool cool now we have yellow plates lots of yellow plates oh we we see some Hebrew in the distance this would be Israel we have some palm trees um would I go t Aviv here I I think I would let's go t Aviv it was oh a bit north of Tel Aviv close enough oh unofficial interesting well is is this a good clue just says the country I don't think it would be a basic meta when it just says the country right there is it really a meta when when it just says the answer I don't think so not a fan of this location but let's just go Colombo okay uh the best best uh game thus far close to 25k oh no no that was single player no we want challenges let's keep going let's keep going uh K kava I thought it said Kev at first uh we have cic here oh that that UA yeah do we see any Ukrainian we do have this this eye letter that you wouldn't see in Russian but it is in um Ukrainian so if you see cilic with his eye um probably Ukraine uh what is be Kev it doesn't really say Kev it just looked like that but it's a big city I think I will go Kev also yeah this eye and this eye as well I have the video with like different languages different letters a spreadsheet I will leave it in the info card for the video um you can go and check it out if you want to learn those those different letters and what countries they are quite useful I think so let's go Kev nice um okay this is a similar Pole to what we saw before uh except without the horizontal lines uh you see these in um basically Chile and New Zealand pretty much I believe um this wouldn't be Chile um this this um this posum guard is is uh quite common in in both Australia and in New Zealand you can you can sometimes see it so and just general the landscape just feels very kiwi to me just just the Vibes you know feel like the the more I play the game the more Vibes just just I I get the Vibes sometimes I I don't know why but just just feels like one particular country even if I don't see any particular metas or anything we have some mountains that don't look super high and snowy this I think I'll still go southern island somewhere here okay yeah nice we have uh New Zealand again right same poles with bosome guards Hobart treat well I don't think this is Hobart Hobart is in Tasmania city um with these polls this would not be austral really we have some high mountains some Snowy Mountains this time so I think it would be the it should be the southern island now uh somewhere closer to these mountains here yeah yeah nice okay we have this small antenna which is a good clue but you see it in a few countries in particular in in Latin America in Mexico Ecuador Colombia and Brazil those are the the infamous four with this antenna um with a landscape with these trees um my first thought was Mexico whether are the poles the PO poles I think are octagonal poles with like eight sides which you see in Mexico as well and if we check the sun should be in the South it's a little bit to the South but very high in the sky but slightly slightly to the South because cuz the white um arrow is slightly above the red one when the sun is in the middle that's how I usually tell the the sun Direction in case maybe someone didn't know so let's go Mexico looking like this I would go maybe maybe a bit north somewhere here it wasn't as North but okay still good okay what is the clue here here that it says Helsinki there I think maybe also it says KATU and G and you see the signs both in Finnish and Swedish you see that in quite a few Finnish cities but yeah just the the multilingual signs the fact that it says Helsinki a language that looks Finnish uh and The Pedestrian crossing sign with five Stripes uh cuz in Sweden it would be four stripes in Estonia it would be three stripes in Finland it is five um so yeah well let's go as it says Helsinki have I been here I wonder I have been to Helsinki probably have been here as well actually I haven't been to Helsinki in a while maybe I should visit sometime soon okay nice let's view the results 32,00 uh 30 I can't speak 23.2 th000 Let's do let's go for one one more game one last one just so the video is a bit longer and you get more playalong uh links and if you're enjoy enjoying these playalong videos tip videos press that like button so I know and leave a comment what what are your favorite tips that you use that you saw in a video that you didn't see in the video I always enjoy reading your comments as you know so what was the clue was this stop sign a clue I I believe it was right yeah this uh wooden um signpost uh the wooden signpost you see more commonly in Canada compared to the US uh cuz cuz we have yellow yellow Middle Line we have English just so either us or Canada and with a wooden stop sign sign post I would go Canada here oh if you turn around we see well we don't see it saying maximum but this is the design of the Canadian SS that would say maximum up here um so maximum in Canada speed limit in the US which state uh which province would this be is the question I am not so sure oh we have the Canadian flag there as well I would H maybe go somewhere like East not sure which province at all though but let's see oh was not East ouch that was painful yeah Canada is a big country so you can really lose a lot of points there blue and white Chevrons you see that in Spain France Spain France definitely um yes I think something else as well cuz this I don't think this is either Spain or France I believe with this little bubble here it would be um Qatar no let's have a look around um interesting I actually did not know you get these blue and white Chevrons in Qatar but I believe with with with this I hope I'm not mixing something up but we do see some Arabic on that sign so that would check out uh interesting see I'm learning something new as well I'm I'm glad I did cuz cuz all the previous tips I pretty much new this one that's that's something new for me and yeah this this bubble well let's we're going to verify it in a second but but one way to tell Qatar and UAE apart because they sometimes can be quite similar um is this this this uh like antenna with a bubble on top on the left side not always I don't think but but if you do see it uh then yeah that's a good clue now these bards you know I like bards oh wait oh my God where where would this be they are similar to the Austrian ones but they're not the austri ones they you can see them in like um Russia but this is not Russia this would be that looks like a regular Austrian Boward though or Austrian Slovenian Boward in Serbia you can see like bards like that as well but Serbia with an antenna maybe let's go Serbia sometimes it was Serbia yeah so sometimes in Serbia you have an antenna sometimes you don't yeah those bards confused me a little bit but yeah when the the red reflector goes all the way to the top um you can see that in Serbia I'm pretty sure you can see those bards in Russia as well but we had the blue strip on the car so it uh you very rarely see that in Russia unless some European car stumbles in wait what's what's the clue here the currency Philippines currency currencies are a good uh good clue actually if you know them cuz you often times do see um currencies of the countes somewhere not so helpful in Europe but uh like in in other countries like Philippines could help you tell it apart we have a lot of English here as well driving on the right side I believe well hard to tell really but um yeah just just feels very much like the Philippines so what this just be does it say The city here Travelers right down I don't I don't know I don't think so I don't recognize any of the names so let's just go Manila nice we have cilic we have some Latin letters we have this big pedestrian crossing sign with three stripes interesting what's the clue here are these the design of the signs maybe a clue I'm not entirely sure these these signs might might be unique to a city or something not entirely sure this feels like is this Russia I think it would be right uh wait this looks like a Mongolian um pipe this is an interesting one this one's confusing me oh Kazakhstan could it be I don't know if Kazakhstan has this car interesting cuz this feels like a new coverage but weird yeah let's go let's go aana maybe um it was Mongolia after all damn it okay well that was rough cuz that was some new coverage that I hadn't seen before I I must have missed that Mongolia has had a new new coverage well now I know well that that pipe made me think that maybe Mongolia but yeah well now I know that Mongolia has new coverage so this was by far my worst uh worst one but at least learned something new which is what's the most important thing well let me know how you did if you learned something new don't forget to press that like button and on the right side there will be another playalong tips video that I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/IsIr0u3vYJRxrCGP", "data/images_geopeter/W9343JH02JZE0sGG",

trying to recognize them from above if you want to play along you need a satellite view uh enabled so to add the script I'll leave an info card up there if you haven't done that before and of course the playong links will be in the description as always so good luck to us all and if you enjoy these s vide videos don't forget to press that like button it really helps with the algorithm what is happening here why is everything okay let's try to refresh I'm not sure what happened there okay everything seems to be fine now after refreshing uh all right so we can minimize that and yeah good luck to us all first thought is Europe with these windy roads everywhere and and yeah but let's let's have a closer look is it Europe is it something else actually actually uh in Europe I would have expected a better quality coverage have some yellow lines you don't see those too often like that in Europe either so now I'm starting to think that this is not Europe where are the Shadows going Shadows are going slightly to the north so we would be in the northern hemisphere we should be which side are we driving on can we tell the the quality is not the best but would be really helpful to tell I think we're driving the left side this car seems to be driving here this car seems to be driving here this one as well so I think we're driving on the left side huh so driving on the left side Northern Hemisphere quite a few countries to choose from still some blue roofs here and there which I usually associate with Asia we have some what are these what are these solar panels or something or or what is this I'm not sure what those are but okay um we have a river that goes it looks like it it enters either a sea or or some bigger River or something and that is an airport no can I zoom in here oh no that's never mind that's a that's a port not an airport a massive Port oh my God all of these shipping containers that's crazy that is crazy we have an airport here with one Runway I'm not sure which country this is I'm thinking maybe Malaysia maybe um maybe Bangladesh maybe India banglades so okay let's try to find where this River might be chat gr wouldn't work no let's assume that this River enters since this is such a massive Port let's assume there is a sea to our Southwest so let's try to align it based on this assumption yeah I don't think it's Malaysia I don't think it's Indonesia what else could it be ever Japan could it be there's another smaller airport here where would they have these yellow squares what is that language if we weren't driving on the left side I would have said it kind of looks Korean but this can't be Korea um could those be could this be Mandarin could this be something like could this be Hong Kong does Hong Kong have a river like that anywhere there let's have a look there is some water here but nothing like that I don't think this wouldn't be China wait could this be Singapore and Malaysia wait a minute it just occurred to me that this RI what I thought was a river goes all the way here so could it be I think yeah that that is the big Port H okay like did didn't see like a I thought this is one big city so that that that's that's uh what threw me off initially okay okay that makes a lot of sense actually now cuz it yeah it align it aligns perfectly so we would be somewhere here so here is that intersection and we are where we are like somewhere here is um somewhere here okay nice 5K Good Start Good Start let's hope it continues that way this initially immediately looks much drier I see some heels um yeah rough terrain still a big city though looks like a very big city um so I was thinking maybe some somewhere in Middle East but but what city would work with this layout or maybe maybe this is somewhere in America like like Arizona or something let's okay let's zoom in let's have a look what is this we have a big stadium so maybe it is America very gridlike structure you do see that in America in in American cities often as well the houses don't feel particularly American maybe I'm not sure let's but yeah let's investigate now the quality isn't the best again we're driving on the left side again aren't we it looks like we have the the stop line here indicating driving on the left side the cars also appear to be drawing the left side the Shadows are going to the South so immediately I am thinking well southern hemisphere driving the left side not too many options so either southern Africa somewhere or Australia New Zealand well this doesn't feel like Australia doesn't feel like New Zealand doesn't feel like Indonesia so yeah I'm thinking southern Africa somewhere I think Pretoria has a similar layout no would there be such a big like Canyon or or I don't know how to call it big big gap not sure um let's see ptor PR Ora is this the big gap maybe there is like a big nothingness here do the roads align we have a like a like a turny curvy Road does that uh work I don't think so wait but no this oh wait is is it this wait I'm confused does this work or no I'm still not sure if this is ptor or not is there a stadium somewhere here like the the layout the the angles all work okay is there a big intersection like this somewhere here yes okay it is ptor cool okay good that that that's confirmed so we are very much very much so that's the big intersection there so we would be why why do I find it this it's so hard to align it okay this this this is the this is this the these two roads down here let's zoom in so it's kind of the same size so it would be around here is near the gulf course is this the golf course I guess it is this must be there is a golf course in around that shape this is the highway and where where is the pin the pin is more South M so okay this is that road we are like here I think on this near this intersection okay that took way too long to to to figure out but I did so I'm happy about that ooh ooh ooh okay big city huge City massive City next to us some sort of a straight all right right well my first that was Turkey but I don't think it aligns the boss for a straight I don't think it does okay well let's see we have a an island with a big massive airport big massive airport for a big massive City this type of Stadium always makes me think maybe us but then we have a looks like we have a bunch of rail a lot large railroad system so then I'm starting I think no probably not us probably just Europe and also doesn't feel that gridlike the city so that's another reason not to think us there is a big bridge it wouldn't no yeah it's not this bridge I was thinking maybe Copenhagen Malmo but yeah it doesn't really work doesn't really work there well well let's see what what else can we spot maybe I would assume that we're driving on the right side this time but let's make sure quality again isn't the best the Shadows kind of seem to almost be going south a little bit so if this isn't Europe what would it be it looks like we are driving on the right side driving on the right side what what is that V that's that's a weird the road coloring these are lots of interesting long houses where would this be Brazil ever o could this be Rio wait with these mountains I didn't pay attention to these mountains but uh I feel like Rio could maybe work can we spot Christ the Redeemer somewhere I don't remember where exactly it was but I'm thinking this could be Rio let's let's see let's have a look it would work with being in the Southern Hemisphere and I think the City layout would work as well yes it does and wait does it yes it does oh here is the Big Island didn't notice it was that so big that I didn't even notice that the island is there okay I never had noticed this island in Rio always thought it was connected interesting interesting interesting all right so we are we are like somewhere here is there is another airport here everything's like from an angle so it's hard to see where the streets really are so there is the cathedral this one we would be one second street over I think on this street is that the first thing intersection I think it's this intersection here okay all right good good good round number four it looks like there are a lot of big cities in this map I thought there might be some smaller ones as well but we're getting some massive ones um is this Miami I think the the layout City layout reminds me of Miami very much let's see if it works is it Miami uh it is yes okay so this is a very easy one now can we spot it this is a very interesting uh Bridge with Island does this count like I imagine this probably counts as a very exclusive place to live but I don't think I would like to live here I don't think so anyways um we are oh we are on this one on here like here is is that the right intersection or that we have that one that one I think we are yeah yeah somewhere here I for a second I thought it wouldn't be 5K but it is good and the last game of this map round of this game is what I mean okay this one looks much smaller than the previous ones I spoke too soon that all the cities are big and massive this one looks way way way smaller so this my this is where our perfect score well my perfect score might go U my first thought was Brazil again the Sun is going the Shadows are going to the South so we are in the southern hemisphere the just the the houses the blue roofs everything giving me kind of Brazilian Vibes maybe so yeah Brazil is a Big Country so if it actually is Brazil I feel like there's no shot that I find this small City too bad we can't find any phone number codes or anything like that looking from above is that that's what usually really helps in Brazil to kind of region guess which side are we driving on let's just verify that it is on the right side is it on the right side I'm starting to think it isn't it looks like the cars are driving on the left side on of the road huh well that certainly changes things all right uh it wouldn't be Brazil then it well it would have to be southern Africa somewhere with these mountains rugged mountains the rain I would go either luru or eswatini then well we have an airport here I'll get a small one still an airport towards like the western side of the city I don't imagine there are many airports in luru and eswatini surely there is one near mazeru this wouldn't ever be no this isn't mazeru the mazeru has this this River up top that kind of separates it from South Africa I don't see it here let's just see okay the airport in luru is down here southeast of luru uh mazeru let's see what's happening intini mban is there an airport somewhere towards the western side of the city not really not really wait is is that an airport it it it looks like one and I think it aligns I didn't see an airport in baban so I was looking at nearby cities is that an airport or just maybe Royal eswatini National Airways Corporation Mata mats sappa airport it's a mataa airport that doesn't even a show up on the map okay cool cool cool cool but we are here we are here here in mataa now we have 5 minutes to pinpoint this so we would be so we have this road splitting open and this is the river stone Mall you're on this bottom yellow Road oh boy fot gear punu Mall this is that's a shoe store a big shoe store and we would be right here I think right next to that Park okay yeah for a second I really thought that that's that's a hopeless round but luckily it wasn't Brazil it was ASD so all right that's a good one uh let's do one more let's do one more one more game again links uh links in the description if you want to play along press the like button and let me know if you are playing along let me know your scores uh did you manage to beat my scores well probably not in the first game maybe but maybe you matched it um but yeah let me know I'm always interested to read your comments so what is this this looks kind of tricky from the get go City doesn't look too small but I don't see many like any water any rivers that could help us pinpoint this so let's have a look what do we have here we are driving on the right right side of the road and the Shadows are going to the north so yeah that's that I'm not sure where this would be to be honest so mountainous driving on the right side Northern Hemisphere and pretty big city it would not work with bhan it would not what is that Stadium I don't think I looked at that doesn't help there's like a canal going through the city I just noticed Canal would this be in Europe or not I still can't tell for sure some private houses with pools very fancy ah this could this ever be like North Macedonia or something would that work scop there is a canal there are some Mountain mountains is it there is a stadium I think it is okay yeah I I was really confused for a while here but uh yeah I mean North Macedonia makes sense if it was I wasn't sure if it was Europe if it was Europe I was thinking like North Macedonia was my main guess because of like the City layout and the mountains probably should have checked it right off the bat um okay we have we are right next to this bridge I think yes so like here toy store jumbo we're right there nice good good good o another massive oh my God this is a big big big city a very big one um we have another straight here we have an airport um this would not be Istanbul either Istanbul does not look like that oh no it does whoa I zoomed in on istan to show it doesn't look like that cuz I I thought I thought the layout oh no okay never mind it does work yeah by trying to show it doesn't look like Istanbul turned out to be Istanbul Okay cool so it is the boss for a straight the famous one so we are this Road here so I think we would be right here nice that was a weird round but I mean istall made a lot of sense it was a very big city another pretty large looking City my this is not um not oh my God uh Dublin I couldn't remember Dublin's name but this is not Dublin for sure um what other cities are are facing East this it wouldn't be Copenhagen Let's see we have lots of small Islands here nearby lots of big skyscrapers Shadows are going north yellow lines yellow lines okay so not Europe huh yellow middle lines oh only this says only English so this would be us huh okay I was thinking the skyscraper is this the sheer amount of skyscrapers doesn't feel European we have a baseball field here as well so if we're in the US which city would this be we're facing East um of course this could be Canada as well but um probably not Canada is this Boston it is cool because there there are a bunch of cities Facing East in the US but not many that really are so Coastal on the East Coast like there's Miami well Jacksonville a little bit but out of big cities like Boston New York Miami and that's basically it okay so this shouldn't be too hard to pinpoint we are here I think yes very nice next another Boston cuz at first I thought something glitched out but now I see that it's a different location it's not on the same spot so I think we just happened to accidentally get this same city twice in a row I mean I I can refresh just in case maybe something did glitch out but I think it's just Boston again I think um okay well let's zoom in on Boston I don't think this ever has happened in s in satellite view videos with me before um so that's something new but I mean I'm this is a weird video like two boss in a row accidentally finding Istanbul uh yeah well you never know how these videos might go so we have we have we have that that that that River Charles River so we have the highway going here the big Highway we would be so we have the baseball field there is there a baseball field here here I don't see there is a big park I think that is that big park it would align and the pin is right is it here street is there I think we are like here nice very nice very good and the round number five not Boston this time not Boston somewhere is still Coastal and and and pretty large we have a stadium a big one um the Shadows are going south my first thought was like South Africa maybe but let's see which side are we driving on is it left is it right it looks left yeah we have this line here should indicate left side uh driving so would this be South Africa then or what could this be Australia um H we have like a mountain with some with a beach Rocky Beach here Cliffs where I'm thinking about like South African Coastline Australian Coastline New Zealand Coastline where would it be like this let's let's have a look I what it oh okay well yeah well I knew it wasn't Cape Town so I just zoomed in on the next biggest City and then it is there yeah oh gosh how do you pronounce [Music] ITA my apologies for my terrible pronunciation I'm sure it was very wrong but yeah it is it is this city now all we have to do is align it so we have this big intersection here we are right beneath it the this intersection down here I think we are near inuka frag fragrances cosmetic store very nice very nice so two perfect scores admittedly this was an easier map today but I was in the mood for something easier and let me know in the comments how you did uh if you got perfect scores as well or not and on the right side there will be another play along satellite view video I think you will enjoy don't forget to press the like button and

we are going to play a map called longest road of every country made by aie golfer and his community so I'm sure it's going to be a great map go and check out Aussie golfer if you don't know him already and yeah this map has mostly labeled roads all around the world so let's get to it let's play some games and see how we do let's have the time limit to minute 30 and and good luck good luck if you do play along let me know how you do in the comments and don't forget to press that like button if you enjoy these play along videos so the longest road we have the white car here which would indicate and we're drawing on the left side which would indicate somewhere southern Africa Delta Farm Medical Center I think this is Botswana we have these black and yellow stripes and in general looks very flat very Botswana likee can we see what these we can't see what these signs say huh so we are on an intersection T way intersection road goes like that so somewhere near gabaron maybe where are there any T way intersections here would this be the longest road could it be somewhere here fron Town Road could this be it Delta Farm Medical Center is that somewhere no this is like a t way intersection but this might not be the right road I don't know well let's see we don't have much time anyways it was definitely not the right Road it was the other side of the country it was kzi A1 well yeah A1 is the longest road was I on the A1 as well or no that's what what is that what is the one that I was on wait is that not even labeled really okay well not the greatest start at least I got the country right but could have wished for something better oh is this Mexico what do we have we have I think these are Mexican Shields I believe so is that does it say 15 Road 15 in Mexico where is that I think it would be somewhere Northern no I think in general the smaller numbers are more North in Mexico if here is 15 um here's so mazatan Durango where is that Mazatlan here Mazatlan is to our South Mazatlan is or South Durango deic I don't know where the the the other ones are deic and Durango I just oh Durango is that big one I felt like I had heard of Durango but where is seeing that epic durang that Durango there made me guess somewhere close to here cuz cuz there is a road to Durango otherwise I would have guessed somewhere a bit further but okay cuz I felt like I had heard Durango but I couldn't find it along Road 15 Kasa Brazil well I think we are in Brazil and where does it say 27 code 27 oh where was 27 exactly I know approximate region so like was was s Pao 21 or was Rio no I think Rio was 31 was s Paulo 21 so 27 would be around is s Pao maybe if I remember correctly maybe I'm misremembering uh Bravo yeah definitely 27 yeah um but but but but where I don't see any city names that I would recognize at least well I don't recognize any of these Victoria okay I can guess V colatina and Victoria I can guess glance a little bit colatina Victoria maybe I noticed something like that nearby unlikely though but I'm going to guess somewhere along here I imagine lots of oh no was 20s oh yeah I definitely misremembered I opened the phone codes the 10 were here 20s were along the coast and 30s were here okay yeah I definitely misremembered that one well yeah not happy about that guess uh this will this be Argentina we have S to the north Generation 4 yellow middle lines very deserty Argentina would be my main guess here I think Chile wouldn't have yellow it is yellow right it looks yellowish or is it no this one looks white but that's no that that's 100% yellow no way that's that's white I mean maybe it's very dirty white but I would say it's yellow cuz cuz if it's white then I would go Chile but but I would I think this is more likely Argentina this deserty where's the road Direction slightly slightly like like to Northwest where somewhere here one of these roads Road 40 would Road 40 be that long maybe Ro 40 does seem pretty long it goes all the way oh yeah Road 40 is very long I I'll go there I don't know it was Chile it was white it was a white line after all damn it it looked yellow it looked so yellow well I was sort of in the right region but yeah the wrong country because of the road lines that sucks and I didn't really see any plates to to confirm or deny my suspicions is this Brazil again we have these South American plates is this the same road as before I didn't check how many locations are in this map I'm guessing you probably can get multiple locations in each country but it would be the same road wait it said it said five locations in Monaco and 120 in Australia but would it all be the same road then I I guess so right if the map is longest road in every country surely it's the same road not not like 120 longest roads so the longest road in Brazil was here is somewhere is it didn't look it was near Victoria was it 101 it might have been 101 101 yeah 101 looks like a long road so okay I'm thinking we're 101 well if it's a long road in Brazil I mean 101 might going very far it is going very far from here I'm going to still keep it around here cuz it is quite mountainous in this area I think it could fit maybe let's see oh it was way yeah it was way further north I was thinking it would be a bit more drier there but I guess further north it gets super dry not here yet oh yeah here is that that river that we saw okay yeah makes sense makes sense the game definitely could have been better I'm not super happy with my result in the first game but we have more games so don't you worry let's go with game number two again link of course in the description we have the whole sign here oaso U so this would be um this would be Estonia right uh where is oaso tardu I do not no those cities would be nice to have cities that I have heard in Estonia so Road 14 one 141 where is 14 and this is the longest road huh where is 14 surely near a bigger city would it be near tall here's 14 is this the road maybe so 141 do we see 141 somewhere 141 114 no I don't need 114 Petri almost like Peter uh 14 141 141 we are like right here I think oh okay always nice to get a 5k always nice to get a 5k let's go now we are getting back to some India I believe longest road in India huh atali sarjapura HSR layout doesn't dring any bells this writing this writing you would get you wouldn't get it far nor like in the very north um this looks like the writing you would get like like kind of somewhere would that be it I think this looks kind of similar hiad maybe I don't know the proper names for each of those those those writings so not going to even guess but um I think it looks similar to this one um yeah I think we'll just we'll find the biggest road in hi Abad and guess that one which one would be the biggest one somewhere one of these maybe maybe let's see okay it was not here about it was bangaluru okay well that was also a good option for sure let's see we have yellow Middle Line we're driving on the left left side here we have these orange black poles is this Thailand I'm thinking Thailand can we see the language not really not really not really okay well I am thinking Thailand here a big road AC crossing a big river uh how mountainous is it a little bit but not too much not a little bit but not too much I hope this is the to Thailand and hope I'm not tripping so a river could it be this River could it be but this is the biggest road the longest road this one does it align really I don't think it does is Road 32 is it is the road 32 the longest one or is it Road number one maybe that would make sense wouldn't it for Road number one to be the longest but I don't see where it cross crosses River like this this one doesn't align oh this is so little time I'm going to guess Road number one but this RO number one looks very very I was about to click here I swear to God if I had one more second I would have clicked somewhere here I don't know if that bridge in particular but I wanted to click around this city okay but okay still still good score good guess I'll take that um okay again another Island I think it is we have these bards driving left again Generation 4 yellow middle lines yeah this another Thailand this looks more mountainous though so I would so we know for a fact that it's Road number one now I would go more more more North with these mountains I feel this feels more North so we we have Road number one going there what's the direction here so it goes like that and it turns to the right there and sharp turn left here well I don't I'm not going to align it perfectly that's for sure but uh just kind of get the vibe get the vibe somewhere here maybe there's a sharp turn I don't know if that really aligns but might as well guess there okay I wasn't exactly there but it was damn close 14 kilm oh that's yeah that's definitely a sharper turn yeah all right all right uh this is not Thailand anymore what is this is this Conan Springs kup Springs well this would be ay land wouldn't it with this super super red soil oh gosh well maybe not red but kind of more like brownish red brownish red soil where would this be would this be very far north North or maybe maybe it would be well in Australia the longest road one of the longest roads in the world in general is the highway number one which coincidentally goes literally all around the country uh so it could be anywhere except for Tasmania uh so yeah I I have a feeling it might be somewhere here what's the direction like that okay going kind of eastsh I'm not sure if this area has Gen 4 coverage I might be super wrong with with that but but but I don't know I feel like the soil might be similar kind of reddish there so let's see how wrong am I well I was right about Western Australia but uh yeah wasn't definitely up there rip I wouldn't have guessed there yeah honestly I wouldn't have guessed there 19,000 definitely better than the first game though I think we have time for one more let's do one more quick quick one uh let's go let's go we have some Italian signs bologa uh a13 podova okay well I know where balona is balona bolog what is this six the six isn't the road number might be the col marker I'm imagining we're on A1 that would make sense Padova a13 we see a13 somewhere here A113 well bologa is to our looks like kind of Southeast almost a13 wait what could we be on A1 here with the road what what's the road Direction like this well we're definitely not there where the hell are we where does Road A1 go in that direction what so confused somewhere here is there a tunnel further down there oh there's a railroad I should have seen that first oh shoot a shoot I could have used it to align uh wait it's e45 is it okay I was just assuming that we are on A1 but no we're on A14 e41 apparently that's the longest Destro in Italy okay fair enough well it was still a close guess so we're in Ghana with the Ghana car of course I do not know the difference between tapes have not studied that apparently there are different gun tapes that you can use to to tell different regions of GH apart uh uh uh uh uh so the longest road in Ghana well I would assume it's like a big road that connects that connects like like Kumasi an Akra or something or or maybe this road NB is it B or8 I think it's eight whatever um n6 N8 and 10 maybe that looks like a big long one and 12 connects N2 N2 looks massive look at that it goes literally from the north to the very south I'm liking N2 I'm liking N2 here uh what's the direction slightly like that I think it could be potentially somewhere here I think it this area is quite green and a little bit Healy doesn't look super Healy though so maybe a bit of a less Healy region some some parts are heilly some parts less so let's go somewhere here I'm liking N2 guess though it was N2 yeah more North though but but let's go all right next round what we have we have Asia we have uh Taiwan I think yeah we have no is the flag and and and yeah in general we have Chinese language 09 lots of 09 or the phones very mountainous Gen 4 okay Road Number Nine Road Number Nine so where is that is it it is somewhere here I think 9's were also somewhere South Road Number Nine it goes all all over the eastern coast it seems can we see the water um hard to see maybe there is water like past this oh wait we have this Coast here picture of a coast would that fit with Road Number Nine airport is this an airport I was thinking this looks a little bit like airport but on the very Coast Maybe is this is there a tunnel right next no there isn't a tunnel here though uh we don't have time unfortunately but it's somewhere oh but that's 11 we need nine oh it was here oh there is the tunnel yeah what was that it was oh it was a fire station that we saw there okay what was that Coast the picture of the coast it wasn't this H I'm not sure what that picture was from but okay uh round number four what is this driving on the left side I think again King something District municipality yellow outer lines yellow outer lines uh generation four with a Santana yellow UT lines this should be South Africa now wait this is a massive car damn so which road would be the biggest the longest one in South Africa let's have a look I imagine maybe the one that goes along the coast what is it number two would it be two the two goes all the way oh it wases even here goes all the way from nelo all the way to Cape Town that's that's pretty damn long road number one goes through the middle of the country which is also very long oh but it goes all the way up here oh shoot they both are very long both Road number one and Road Road number two but I think the road number two might be longer just cuz it has like the the curve oh gosh oh God I don't know where to guess would we be would we ever be somewhere here it's such a risky guess but okay let's risk it for the biscuit okay it was Road number two wasn't exactly as North as I guessed but but my risky guess did pay off let's go we got the biscuit this time find your fire life bold this is Indonesia isn't it this would be yeah we have Flags suai suai feel like I might have heard of suai was that a city Jambi I know Jambi but suai Sanai no the longest [Music] road uh I don't think it would be on Java would it I think it would be maybe somewhere here on K Monon one of these roads or or or could it ever be this road they're not labeled no they are labeled never mind they have their names not numbers would it be this road this looks like a very long road let's let's go somewhere there I don't know it was kantan and there was suai could I have spotted it no I think it's too small I think it's too small to spot but okay it could have been a worse guess I was in between Sumatra and Kim Manan chose wrong this time 219,000 that's the best score today let's go again let me know in the comments how you did did press that like button and on the right side there will be another playalong video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and yoube members for supporting this channel I really appreciate your support I hope you all have a

are going to play abandoned places I opened up the maps to look what's happening and I saw abandoned places are featured today so I haven't played the map for a while so let's play it today I really enjoy it so if you want to play along as always the links will be in the description you can play along for free with a free account let's say not moving minute and and a half and let's get going let's get going what do we have that certainly looks abandoned we have some windows missing and stuff okay this is an unofficial coverage clearly very well Coastal we're on a beach the vibe the beach looks uh not not not speaking about architecture but the beach looks like it could be in baltics would the architecture fit um I can see the is being Baltic so I could see it somewhere around here so either baltics or maybe krad or something like that um maybe Poland Northern Poland or something but just just the Vibes the the architecture getting getting Baltic Vibes anything with people Nothing interesting there so I think I kind of want to go Lithuania Maybe let's see okay it was lva well I was right about the Vibes it did feel very much like baltics easily could have been Lithuania this time it was lva right here AKA so AA Lighthouse that's what it was well we did have a lighthouse there yeah okay well that's certainly abandoned looks like some some ancient Fortress or a prison or something where would this be um we we have very interesting looking Place some more modern bricks some more ancient walls looking like yeah but I don't know where this would be I'm thinking maybe somewhere Middle East we have a bunch of tourists here visiting um maybe Middle East maybe Northern Africa is what I'm thinking somewhere somewhere there Egypt ever Egypt Maybe Egypt or or or Jordan maybe no Jordan has a bunch of old like fortresses and stuff let's go Jordan oh okay it was more East it was Middle East it was Iran Eastern Iran okay was was yeah I didn't know didn't know this one oh failed to load Panorama well well I guess we we're skipping the round number three there well since this map does have a lot of unofficial coverage locations then yeah some might have been removed or or missing or something so okay well round three was a [Music] dud that's okay well this this looks kind of cool looks like this used to be some sort of a camping site or something with lots of these small houses for staying here and now it's all abandoned I guess the business business didn't go too well okay well these white bricks I don't think this is baltics again but I'm thinking this might be somewhere in the vicinity maybe something like Ukraine or something or bellarus we see some water maybe Russia the the the language well this is graffiti but uh it is Latin alphabet on the on the graffiti so proba not neither of the countries that I listed so but maybe something like Romania Hungary Slovakia let's go Romania maybe oh po okay well Poland makes a lot of sense as well um yeah well what's next the last round some more ruins like Pro this time proper ruins instead of just an abandoned house um my first thought was somewhere in the I'm thinking could this be somewhere like turkey Georgia somewhere one of those countries maybe we don't have any graffiti anywhere there is like some sort of a small house or something there but I'm not sure I don't think it helps much this definitely feels kind of Mediterranean to me so I'm thinking turkey maybe something like like I don't know Spain Italy maybe but I think I'm going to stick with turkey oh it was Italy actually yeah it actually was Italy well I did mention it it was one of my my options there all right let's view the results 12,000 but one round was skipped so that that's a zero pointer um all right let's do one more let's do one more uh again challenge Link in the description of course and if you do play along let me know in the comments how you do and don't forget to press that like button if you enjoy these play along videos so I know to make more of them all right oh this is cool this is cool like a proper like old factory or something T we have some ceric here but this is not cilic so we have both some ceric and no ceric what is this language here it's hard to read is that no is is it German what is I think we have estet here the estet letter so it may be German it's really hard to read but uh German would be my guess so we have some cilic some German okay well German and cilic that would maybe make sense for somewhere where both Germany and Soviet Russia has ruled so maybe Poland baltics let's go more baltics I don't know um oh okay it was just Russia was it German maybe it wasn't German then it looked German but why would there be German on a building in St Petersburg that doesn't make much sense if you know what was happening there let me know in the comments cuz yeah I don't know um oh okay this is a fancy abandoned building is it actually abandoned there are like curtains inside still maybe it's just very poorly upkept cuz all the windows are still well okay almost all the windows are still there I I wouldn't be surprised to find out someone's still living there really um okay but okay what is this um this was this feels kind of European again but uh with this architect Ure where would it be I was thinking maybe something like CIA Germany Poland again a Austria I'm kind of liking Germany guess here you know Eastern Germany somewhere here okay more North it was north of Berlin pretty good I'm happy with this guess there's a boss Stop nearby yeah I'm I'm not convinced that that was an abandoned house still maybe just not very well-kept uh this does look abandoned everything's boarded shot here some sort of a an old church or something no parking well this does feel like the US no but this is definitely an unofficial coverage here oh that's also abandoned right all the windows boarded shot as well feels kind of spooky is this whole neighborhood abandoned oh my God this I'm this is this is spooky for sure this is giving me some sort of like a old Psychiatric clinic Vibes like like in the movies you see um I don't know where where where where in the US would this be I would maybe go I don't know somewhere Indiana let's go Indiana oh it was Canada okay well fair enough London it was London but the London in Canada that London well that wasn't too far actually wrong country but but not too far okay is this another church I guess it does not want to load properly that's not good oh it did cool we have some fences this is giving me kind of Mediterranean Vibes again something like like Italy Spain Portugal can't really read what it says here that could be helpful is that water there is water nearby so it is kind of coastal these stone walls maybe could be island this could be an island maybe sometimes in uh on Islands you see like more stone walls but but obviously could be anywhere um this no I don't think it's an island usually Island walls have bigger rocks I think let's go let's go Spain maybe Portugal it was Spain yeah yeah it was definitely wasn't an island oh it was near uh near like a river so that was that water I see okay okay I really like looking at these abandoned places I think they're super fascinating is this abandoned this this I guess this is an old fortress or something cuz definitely looks like it's a part of some sort of Museum or something nowadays definitely being upkept this this is a tough one I don't really know much about fortresses if we could see some regular architecture that could be helpful but this could be anywhere really I think I'm going to go with Europe cuz it's just seems like the most locations are in Europe but where in Europe not sure well let's go somewhere Cent like France Eastern France oh it was Germany again okay well Germany was I was considering Hing Germany as well just just for the like Central n part but okay Germany okay yeah where was it DB H okay well the results 19,400 better than the last game and let's go for one more three third times the charm so let's go for the third one so you can you have more games to play along to um all right this is tricky definitely abandoned looks like pretty old bricks I love what what does she love I Love Roma Rome is this Italy could this be Italy I wasn't thinking Italy I was thinking more like Georgia or something but maybe it doesn't say Ro Roma I'm not sure if I trust her shirt I want to go like yeah like I was thinking something like turkey Georgia again might be super wrong no idea but let's see oh was it Armenia okay it's Armenia well I'll take that I'm glad I didn't go with Italy there uh but I've been to Georgia before it was kind of similar Vibes very beautiful country if you if you get a chance to go Georgian food amazing house this was a house apparently private residence and who lived here is unknown so this is some sort of a museum I'm guessing with with u i I guess and in English please do not Venture past this point uh well well well well English will this be us I don't know there is this house in the distance so this kind of Red Roof what would that mean there is a house here I'm I don't know what to guess I'll be honest ever Australia I don't know if this house South Africa maybe maybe I don't have a good guess here I don't have a good guess I'll go South Africa I don't know somewhere English speaking but it was us uh okay well us makes sense probably would have been a safer guess than than South Africa it was Old Iron Town no it did say something about Iron Works on that um sign okay interesting very fascinating all these places I have to say bada bada bing wow okay bada bing what's happening here Wednesday to Saturday at 1 p.m. Bada Bing is this abandoned I don't I don't think that's abandoned though Bada Bing so do we have a front plates or what do we have I can't really read those signs the angle is a bit too strong there well this is either us or Canada but but we have a big stop sign there we only see back blades and I I don't recognize them I don't know the back I don't know the plates that well I just recognize a few and this is the American style truck as well in the distance some sort of Bridge there well um let's go let's go Kentucky I don't know oh my first plunk in Illinois would have been much better but still not too bad I guess Burlington oh near Gulfport okay it was gulport cool cool cool oh this is definitely abandoned this is giving me some some us Motel Vibes you see in the movies could be interesting to stay in such a such a motel well maybe not abandoned one but we have no trespassing we have English on that sign we have some American looking poles no front plate or maybe that car no that car is abandoned maybe the front plate has been just ripped off Associated food stores exit well I think this would be us again what do show Girls show girls in this direction I can't see what I think it might be an interstate sign but I can't see what number it says there um but just by the mountains The Vibes I'm thinking somewhere around like California Vegas Arizona somewhere in this area is what is what I'm feeling was UDA okay a little bit more North but I was kind of right about the region so I'm happy about that I think this this map is good for like getting your Vibes practicing the the vibe guessing cuz often times it's unofficial there isn't the usual meod that you can rely on so I think it's a cool practice to to see if you can recognize places even without car meta or or stuff like that now what is this though this whenever I see um like like ruins like this I'm thinking uh Turkey Greece uh Jordan has some similar Tunisia has some ruins like this I think I've seen there as well we have some palm trees this is so cool let's go kind I want to go turkey again turkey is calling my name today let's go near antalia somewhere there oh okay well Cypress makes perfect sense yeah that that's why it felt so much like tur and and the neighboring countries it was Mediterranean so all right how how did I do this time 15.8 th000 well could have been better but but all in all yeah there aren't too screwed me over there but um again let me know in the comments how you did press that like button and on the right side there will be another playalong video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel your support means a lot to me and I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and

are going to play some viewer Maps either viewer made Maps or the ones you all have submitted either in the comments or on Discord quickly before we start big thanks to Lauren who is one of my patrons thank you very much for your support if you want to become a patron and get early access to my videos and some exclusive ones as well check out the link in the description so let's get to it we have quite a few maps to go through uh if I don't play yours feel free to suggest it again in the comments or on Discord we have a channel for that but all right let's get going tennis court and stadium so the maps that will be here are very various some are local some are Global uh but yeah let's let's uh test them out spots to play tennis all over the world includes official coverage and photos spheres okay good to know I'll make it of course a playalong challenge let's make it no moving and to keep things fast okay let's let's have it minute 30 uh if if you want to spend a bit more time but I'll try to be a bit faster here so this is the tennis court Stockholm open well I imagine we might be near Stockholm just just something tells me it might be the case I haven't been here though I've been in Stockholm quite a few times haven't been here but uh tell we have the faery is that a fair sign E20 where is E20 let's see it might be near the um Port possibly where is E20 E20 is here E4 also there 277 well E20 is to our East it's in that direction so maybe it's somewhere here is so where is a tennis uh field here tennis court is this a tennis court doesn't look like no that doesn't look like that road what's the direction we are running out of time I mean it kind of the direction kind of aligns so maybe no it doesn't work ah okay we were here okay oh and yeah here it says Tennis Hall okay well not too bad though kind of close-ish okay we have another tennis court here this is an unofficial coach what is this box what is this that's a very interesting vehicle for uh covering Street fi no this looks very tropical that's that's the first thing that I notice here I'm thinking some islands maybe but where would this be in Caribbean would this be in Oceania would this be elsewhere getting maybe maybe Caribbean Vibes gosh okay let's go let's go Caribbean somewhere since this is unofficial it could be anywhere let's go Guadalupe maybe okay okay it was okay it was not the island it was what is this uh is it Mexico still I'm guessing it's still counts as Mexico looks like it at least interesting hadn't seen coverage from there before I think Spiel zat Z that looks German so would this be Germany or Austria maybe getting more Austrian Vibes here what do we see H willon I don't see any domain names domain names would be nice uh but I don't see any we have is it well the architecture feels maybe kind of more Austrian or Southern Germany somewhere in that area I would say it looks a bit heilly as well so that would work too yeah I'm not sure don't see any other Clues besides that so okay let's go somewhere in that area where I was thinking somewhere maybe here K Kel let's go there oh no it was Austria it was kind of in the area that I thought just more Northeast less less heilly in that area than I went I went a bit too mountainous kids okay what do we have well this is unofficial this is unofficial F foro Ferrero R I don't know what's what is it says there there isn't too much info here some trees look very dry others are more green than some I'm thinking this might be Latin America again I don't know just maybe Brazil H or maybe a country that doesn't have official coverage something like Nicaragua or something let's go Nicaragua I don't know well it was a Spanish speaking C country at least I guess but it was very wrong it was Spain oh gosh I wasn't thinking Spain didn't feel too European but well I guess I was wrong on that one now what is this tennis court I have never played tennis in my life so I know nothing about tennis i w I watched a little bit of tennis so I think the points go 15 30 40 it's the weirdest pointing system in tennis do you know why if you know why it's so weird let me know but why is it 15 30 40 makes no sense to me anyways what is this we have some language 05 so 05 this has to be France right with the 0 five number and I think yeah the the language does look French as well yeah so 05 05 would be southwestern part and know somewhere here is with these mountains around so I would go maybe closer to the border with Spain somewhere here okay nice I'll take that that was a finally a pretty good guess I think um okay so that was the score 14,300 but okay let's move on to the next map which is knights in rare countries includes outdoor locations during the night in countries that don't have official coverage so we can already know no official coverage countries and yeah let's let's use that to our advantage when we play this uh let's go again links in the description if you enjoy these playong videos press that like button and let me know in the comments how what are your scores did you manage to beat me or not what were your scores what is this is that can't tell I was thinking maybe a bit Arabic there but maybe not oh I think it's just this logo okay not not Arabic oh the quality is not good enough just to see what what that sign says but okay we have a blue sign design well it it looks like we're driving on the right side at least by the way the sign is positioned so okay that's that's something there lots of trucks people with dark skin uh I don't see any language besides that the one on the sign we can't really trust these containers because I mean they are travel all over the place I would over running out of time I would go where would I go where would I go so can't be Tunisia because it has official coverage Algeria maybe maybe Bina Faso ah it was jouti yeah I had no idea which country that was okay let's move on that was not a good start but we move on oh no okay it's certainly a night all right the title checks out there isn't really anything to to go by here not my favorite map uh thus far at least by these locations that we've been getting but um we have we see kind of some palm trees so it's quite tropical I guess like lots of different bricks different building materials I would probably go Africa again maybe or maybe I kind of want to go Africa again like a Ethiopia or something or I don't know Sudan shall we go Sudan let's go Sudan let's see oh it was Iraq well yeah well there wasn't really anything to to go by there what is this we see an architecture interesting architecture is the first thing that I noticed anything else metal doors yeah well the locations could have been better I'll be honest but uh it's certainly the the name checks out it's definitely Knight so let's where would this architecture be getting maybe kind of Indian Vibes maybe India has coverage so uh Pakistan has coverage as well Afghanistan ever but Afghanistan has may maybe kabol no idea let's see and this was Libya yeah I'm I'm not good at this map okay A bit more uh Urban location so maybe we can find some Clues very fancy looking that's for sure some fancy hotel or something we see some Arabic I guess can't see what it says there that might might have been helpful oh like a concert hall there very fancy very very fancy where would this be maybe maybe somewhere in the Middle East some some oil oil Rich oil countries are these Olympic Olympic rings is this Qatar maybe have any other I don't think any other Middle East countries have hosted Olympics recently at least so Qatar would make the most sense I think but but Qatar has official coverage Qatar has official coverage maybe someone in Bahrain big fan of Olympics let's go Bahrain near Qatar and and doesn't have official coverage Iran well Iran did cross my mind but the Olympic rings didn't make much sense in Iran but okay I guess they're big fans of Olympics there all right what does it say Okay Paraguay one easy one easy location at least for the country so this should be Paraguay imagine if it isn't l be kind of funny but okay Paraguay Paraguay does not have official coverage but there is some spill coverage from Brazil so you can technically go into Paraguay a little bit but it does not have official coverage officially so let's go let's just go the capital no no use trying to figure it out more than that okay one good guess in this in this map 9,000 yeah this was a this was a rough one this was a rough one but let's move on the next one is just called a road trip just like that um yes so let's try it out this was submitted to me a while ago I'm sorry this took me so long to get to it but here we are here we are road trip State Park okay this is Florida A1A A1A not sure where A1A is I don't see any roads named like that on the map at least no parking well definitely looks like FL Florida no front plates looks tropical um maybe closer to Miami somewhere could this be I don't know I'm feeling it might be near the Key West maybe just The Vibes I'm not sure I might be wrong there is some sort of like a river or a canal next to us somewhere here maybe I don't know let's see ah okay it was more North a bit more North oh it was near this strip I guess maybe that's why it felt kind of similar and vibes okay not bad not bad I'm happy well it wasn't difficult though but uh still happy now skate Skate School em Emergency Medical Service I think no definitely a big city do not enter English so this might be all American cities in this map potentially winter village lots of big houses we have American color is up there Bank of America I noticed that the author's name at the bottom right corner says NY is my backyard NYC tours so maybe let's go New York then cuz I would without that I I don't know could be any big American city really but let's go New York maybe somewhere near it's not Central Park maybe washing Washington State Park oh no it was bran Park okay well it was New York so the author's name help on this one yeah that's a that's a little tip if in unofficial locations you could pay you can pay attention to the author's name and sometimes it has some Clues as well uh Budapest Budapest is straight ahead to our East so it's not all in Americas huh not all in Americas so M1 what was the other M7 M1 M7 where is M7 I only see M1 I don't see M7 anywhere is this seven supposed to be M7 is that the same thing like somewhere here where they go oh no here is M7 so we are like it's the same road here they they go together so we are somewhere Ikea here Ikea is like here oh okay I'm glad I get onek one 15K in these maps at least I like this location cuz it was pin pointable okay keep clear this looks like the UK we have some yellow back blades here get in Lane Arbor field t t for no idea where those places are but okay definitely UK somewhere we see some oh no that's a barber shop I thought it was a flag the architecture H I don't think it's super North I would think somewhere in England let's go somewhere there okay A bit bit more south close to London the architecture felt kind of like that okay and back to the US here we are the plate is slightly light yellow I think so I'm thinking it might be oh this is dark yellow dark yellow could be New York light y I think was was it uh New Jersey I think maybe or is it Pennsy I think it was New Jersey with a light yellow plate no so maybe and since we see I think we see a New York Plate as well here maybe somewhere nearby might be even in New York instead let's go somewhere here um yeah let's see okay it was in New York indeed okay uh how did we do 23 , 785 the best game thus far let's go that's very very good next game we have is dead ends in big cities so one challenging handpicked location from all 246 cities in the world with over 1 million inhabitants City proper okay so no Miami uh that also have official coverage okay so all official big cities dead ends okay map for moving players well we'll do we'll do NM no moving but yeah this this sounds like an interesting map for moving for sure so uh let's see so challenge no moving of course all the links as I said before are in the description so if you want to play play along these Maps afterwards as well feel free to of course so this is definitely a dead end we have arrived to the end of this pier so big cities what big city is this we have lots of palm trees well maybe not lots of but but decent amount definitely Coastal oh gosh this is this is tricky H trying to tell see look at the architecture but doesn't help too much where's the sun the sun is right in the middle thank you son I was thinking maybe something like Mexico or or I don't know just getting those kind of Vibes was thinking maybe the U uh not us maybe but I don't think it's us I was thinking maybe Brazil but I think Mexico might be my best shot any Coastal Mexico cities with a million people I don't think so okay let's go Brazil then Rio let's go Rio I I don't think it's RI but but I don't have a better better guess oh oh to Japan the car the car that I saw looked kind of maybe Japanese but other Vibes there was this one car uh on on the other side of the water but yeah the other things didn't feel Japanese I don't know well that's a bad start all right now this looks very South American this time okay this is an electricity counter that you can see a lot in Mexico but sometimes in like Ecuador as well oh we have gu we have Guatemala and car well yeah you can see it in Guatemala too well we would be in Guatemala well it must be Guatemala City right with 1 million people I think it's probably the only one that populous so do we see looks like the city might be to the South so maybe somewhere here is okay not bad not bad lost only 10 points pretty good uh What is this well that's certainly a dead end again so the the name checks out this looks like the US of a or Canada potentially us OFA or Canada don't see any flags do we have front plates we don't I think we don't have front plates I'm kind of leaning more towards Canada to be honest getting more Canadian Vibes or not 100% sure though could could still be the US so since we don't have front plates it could be something like SAS Saskatchewan maybe let's go Regina maybe I don't know let's see ah okay it was Alberta well Alberta also doesn't have front plates Calgary okay Calgary makes sense well I'm still happy with my guess I thought it was a pretty good one okay that's a that's a really nice mural heat heat heat lots of heat we have okay we have uh new yor York plates this is New York and we had English there on that sign on the mural and we have a big bridge what bridge is this what bridge is this H gosh there are quite a few Bridges maybe it's that big one wait oh gosh New York is this the uh where is the bridge this one Bridge maybe would it be this bridge no I don't think so there are a lot of tunnels could it be this bridge are there parks there there are a lot of trees there so maybe we're here it looks like there might be a tennis court there so somewhere here playground Baruch playground are we in the playground oh that's a playground that's a playground so somewhere here I don't know okay 5K let's go that was a good one that was a good one I like getting 5Ks okay kto SPSS from strength to success okay the phone numbers look quite American the plates look quite American Tip Top toe service Tip Top toe um high voltage oh gosh well we are somewhere in the US huh or maybe could be Canada again potentially potentially I do not know the codes State codes Public Safety Security Solutions does say anything State specific I don't think H Stan oh pedestrian Crossing I was thinking Austrian Crossing what no but pedestrian Crossing that doesn't help Maple Maple drove they may be Canada then if we have Maples they like their Maple Leaves there uh okay let's go Canada I I do not see if we have front plates or not so can't really narrow it down let's go Winnie Peg maybe never mind it was La H I wasn't thinking La at all interesting well I mean why wouldn't there be a maple drove in in us but I was thinking maybe more likely Canada because of that all right the results 13,500 not too great and I think this is the oh no this is not this is not the last one yet quite a lot of games today coaster Quest and Route 66 Mysteries ultimate K or is it hide okay so lots of coasters uh near Route 66 I guess well let's see let's see good luck what do we have now very pretty very very pretty some some this is like a restaurant I guess and I guess we have some some roller coasters in the background there well Route 66 goes is it still a thing or was it is it a I think it's a historical route I don't know if it's still visible on the map but I think it went from Chicago to La if I remember correctly I'm not sure if it's still on the map there are a bunch of other highways now so we might kind of approximate where which where it might have been I don't know which which Central City is the did it go like here or did it go over through Colorado not sure and I don't know where these roller coasters are at all so let's just wing it let's go Tulsa oh not bad actually it was in it was in Missouri Silver Dollar City okay so I guess the Route 66 was near here I guess okay so that that answers my question that I had before so guess it wouldn't be went like here okay this is M more mountainous okay okay some some cars with front plates some cars without front plates looks like a quite a touristy place now where would this be could it be somewhere in California maybe it did go could it be in Colorado cuz this feels like Colorado to me I don't know maybe it doesn't necessarily need to be near Route 66 maybe I'm misunderstanding the the the theme cuz this doesn't really feel like Iowa or Oklahoma with this Hills yeah let's go Colorado let's see oh wait what yeah I'm definitely misunderstanding the theme Mount Mitchell very pretty but uh well I guess I'll move forward with with uh with a thought that it could be anywhere family and friends of Andy Ferguson oh they have adopted the highway Highway adoption is such a weird concept to me someone needs to adopt the highway to keep it clean okay we have some high mountains here some high mountains but kind of dry looking so where would it be dry yet with high mountains like that could it be Utah ever there are some high mountains there now or somewhere there that's my best guess I think okay not bad it was okay this was Nevada but very close to Utah so I'll take that very nice what is this oh there isn't much to see here generally flat with some hills some interesting looking Hills um the road goes basically vertically so I'm thinking could this be New Mexico or something New Mexico Arizona let's go maybe Arizona ah New Mexico would have been better it was in New Mexico in Navajo National off reservation trust land okay cool cool cool well we have Chicago here medieval something Medieval Times well 1991 not medieval times but okay it's established in 1991 well this is certainly some theme park yeah Vertical Velocity now would this be Chicago or this is this person just visiting from Chicago both Yankey Arbor I'm not sure I haven't been to theme park so for so long I really want to go don't even remember when was the last time I went must have been like at least 10 years ago I don't know I'm just going to go near Chicago cuz of the the hoodie cuz I haven't seen any other really um things that would ring my bell let's go near there okay it was near Chicago okay let's let's go let's go not too bad so 15,800 in total could have been better but for the US knowing that I'm not usually good with us I'll take that and last but not least we have World religious places so all all 12,000 locations have been handpicked and should start with us looking at the religious building so there might be some unofficial coverage as well or places where there are no official one okay let's go let's go okay that is the religious building Catholic Church St John's Catholic Church tuaran I don't know where tuaran is this looks like Indonesia no where is this Malaysia can't tell by the plates are those Indonesian ones kind of looks like it might be Indonesian one yeah go I don't remember the PO tops I used to study them a long long time ago but I have forgotten them all all of them the Chinese language though I think it's more common to see it in Malaysia not Indonesia so maybe because of that I should go Malaysia after all gosh I'm torn between the two is is that a front plate on that motorcycle cuz you see front plates and motorcycles in Indonesia I think the plates look more Indonesia the language looks more let's go somewhere here I don't know it was Malay Asia after all damn it I knew I should have trusted the language the Chinese language you don't really see it in Indonesia that much but the the plates the the car plate looked Indonesian to me and the Motorcycle looked like it might have front plate so I decided to trust the plates there should I shouldn't have well these are Danish Danish signs Danish everything so is this the this is the church that's under uh reconstruction I guess so we're somewhere in Denmark yeah DK as well well all those are some cute ponies that's adorable I'm thinking kind of more towards Southern Denmark just by The Vibes I don't know how how right my vibes are let's see some let's go somewhere there oh okay my vibes are not good in Denmark can't trust them there okay so this is the church that's checks out it's definitely a church now we have some yellow signs these yellow signs okay this would be Finland right because of The Pedestrian crossing sign has five stripes in Sweden it would be four stripes in Estonia it would be three and Estonia wouldn't you wouldn't get yellow signs either so it's it's not Sweden is what I'm saying should be uh Finland would this be Helsinki would this be something else what would this be doesn't look like Helsinki seems like a smaller City to me H yeah let's go this be like l or t or something let's see it was more East it was laanta that's what it was of course all right we have a palm tree where is the church or religious building or is this it or maybe maybe I'm not sure uh what do we have here we have some yellow plates would this be Israel now oh yeah I see I think I see some Hebrew there on that sign okay okay okay somewhere in Israel uh with some with so many palm trees around I would think it's probably close to the coast so I'm thinking either Tel Aviv or hia kind of leaning towards hia to be honest let's see if my My Vibe is Right nope it is not right there was more south Ashkelon it was okay next one next location Delta universe s support Elites so with this many stripes on The Pedestrian Crossing s this is Spain we are coastal we are coastal here with water to our South that's of course the church in case you missed it no we have a Spanish flag there if we had more time maybe we could try to 5K this but uh let's just it's not aliria doesn't really align what else could it be Malaga no doesn't really a line I don't think Marella Mara I don't know maybe it does a line here any churches do we have a beach we do have a beach do we have any church here did we see the C the names no ah shoot oh wow it was OHA is that how you say it I don't know okay that's a tricky one it is still Spain but it is like an exclave yeah Spain has this city in Africa and where was the other one here this city in Africa needless to say Morocco isn't super happy about those cities but okay well 19,000 that was an interesting end again press that like button if you enjoy this play along videoos so I know to make more let me know in the comments how you did did you manage to beat me in how many Maps let me know and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one

in this map every location has a landmark Monument or attraction behind us might be something famous might be less famous uh I don't know we'll see but yeah if you want to play along the links will be in the description you can play along with a free account as well of course uh let's keep it no moving panning and zooming as it is intended for this map and yeah let's go good luck to every one I think I recognize this I think I think this is the massive statue in senagal I think we we have the coast we have a massive City here to our North this has to be I I I've seen this location numerous times uh can I was it it wasn't on the very tip no no it was not uh can I find it though is the question I think this is it I think this it was African Renaissance Monument I think that was the one and was it the largest statue in Africa if if I remember correctly so we would be we would be kind of on this side hard to really align anything here without in an mpz but we have water to our West so somewhere here is I think let's go somewhere here okay not too bad it is a 5K not nice okay let's open it up see how it looks if we can look around yeah this is the this is the one the massive one really huge statue would be cool to visit it one day maybe okay well we have um Kazakhstan not kirgistan Kazakhstan with this car and uh what would be notable or or or I don't know any like I know in aana there are some really cool looking buildings but this looks more rural than that doesn't look like a castana maybe like outskirts or something um I'm not sure I'm not sure uh let's go where should we go let's go some some smaller town maybe somewhere here near aana is my thought oh okay it was not it was way way west cool Sor cool Ari what was the place is this the place five a is is that is that the significant place is is this it there isn't anything else behind us so maybe this is the place that was supposed to be significant some sort of a salon with a pool a Bard I mean okay not sure about that location but let's let's move on ooh that's a big fish uh I okay so I do not know where this is somewhere Coastal obviously the board is a little bit too far I can't no chance I can't see it what's written there the trees I'm thinking could this be somewhere Mediterranean maybe something like I don't know Montenegro Albania maybe maybe this isn't even europeia this could be somewhere completely different M no I don't think it's Albania why do I think Mediterranean I don't know just some for some reason Mediterranean is calling my name might be very wrong I don't know maybe this could be somewhere in americaas that's possible it could be Asia let's go maybe Americas um Colombia Mexico should we go Mexico should we go Italy let's go Mexico I don't know oh it was okay I was not thinking Australia yeah but yeah why not you know I said why wouldn't it be Australia um it was Adams Point whale Lookout oh that's where there was that oh I guess there was a whale not a fish okay oh and this is the this is the whale Lookout if I had seen the language English language maybe I would have gone Australia but uh uh yeah okay well this is an interesting location even though I only got two points still very interesting okay I think we have a French blade here blue on the left side little bit a bit lighter blue on the right side uh looks like we are somewhere Coastal Coast would be to our West so check out with France the houses could be French as well we have the short dashes that you sometimes see in France too so I'm pretty sure with France I I can't see the text but I can only assume that it's French there where in France would this be could this be near oh wait wait where is the that that that Saint Saint Castle where's the saint Castle I can never find it oh my was it near C oh my it might be that St St Michaels or what was it called I can I can never find it okay it was not what that I was thinking what was that bunker day Yanik let's have a look oh this is the bunker okay I'm guessing that's yeah from from the war remnants okay well yeah I was thinking it's the the the St St Michael's Castle also on the coast of France cyber Precise Land surveys so we have this these yellow back blades which um you get in Kenya and Uganda I think you get yellow back blades in bwana as well but they don't they look different they are wide there well the language seems to be English on that sign but I don't see anything helpful there yeah I don't see anything helpful here um well I'm thinking leaning more towards Uganda I think because of the I don't know I think in Uganda I feel like I see more narrow back plates I might be wrong I might be misremembering something that's always a possibility with me uh but I I want to go Uganda here and let's go compal vast majority of coverage in Uganda is in Cala so let's go that let's do that ah it was Kenya it was Kenya after all a oh well meu what was that meu museum was that the place I see oh this is the yeah this is the museum okay National museums of Kenya meu Museum well it certainly would have helped if we could have uh turned around that is for sure but yeah it was it was Kenya okay well I was between the two so yeah oh well uh how did I do 15.4 th000 could be better could be worse uh but uh let's do one more let's do another game if you are playing along let me know how you are doing in the comments below I always like to read your comments and press the like button if you enjoy these play along videos so I know to make more of them oky doie we don't have the front plate is the first thing that I noticed the second thing that I notice is that we have yellow middle lines so what's the language there I think it says Museum but I can't read anything more than that well this feels like I'm not sure if this would be Puerto Rico or not I think there is like this shield with a number one on it does Puerto Rico have those Shields I don't think so I don't think they do yeah I don't see any Shields here so I I think it is us I don't think it's Puerto Rico without the front blade maybe something like Alabama oh they do have shields here well many states do have shields but Alabama is one of them so let maybe let's go Alabama somewhere this feels kind of coastal Florida I feel would have front plates so I'm not going to go Florida here but let's go something like Alabama or Louisiana or Mississippi or something like that is what I am thinking so let's go somewhere there it was Florida oh it was the K Key West Well turns out I was misremembering things Florida does not have front plates it was only Texas and California from those Southern States well that that that misremembering cost me some points cuz otherwise I would have gone Florida uh okay well what was that famous place um so we saw the Hemingway home and Museum and behind us is Key West Lighthouse Key West Lighthouse Sunset experience that sounds nice there isn't too much to see really just some trees and such but okay wait wait this is the heest lighthouse so we saw it so behind us was the Hemingway House ah okay the Hemingway Museum which is right there cool well yeah if I could have read the Key West part it would have been so helpful cuz I Only Could Have could tell the museum uh there oh well oh this looks oh could this be Minsk maybe we have some cilic I know there is some limited coverage in the city center of Minsk official coverage very limited I'm kind of getting those vibes um maybe CU we do have cilic and it looks like a city center and yeah I'm I'm kind of feeling getting Minsk Vibes here you don't get Minsk very often in geog guesser um but let's try it I might be wrong maybe it's but I don't know what else could it be really maybe a small town in Russia I don't think so though this has to be Minsk I feel so let's go let's go somewhere in the m in Minsk oh never mind it was a small town in Russia kov interesting okay fair enough kov has some Minsk Vibes in my opinion what so what did we have behind us we have meeting point we have Creo a museum of history of chocolate oo okay this is a very nice Street I have to say very uh like like clean looking and and pedestrian friendly so that's really cool so and is this the chocolate chocolate Place well we have some chocolate museums uh uh in Latvia so if you come to lvia good place to visit is a chocolate Museum very nice oh something on official now oh gosh they are really not giving us a lot of information here so we have unofficial coverage we have a house with a very like minimalistic architecture feels looks kind of European I would say looks like an old European house to me maybe somewhere in kind of Central or Eastern is Europe maybe something like I don't know Hungary or Slovakia or something like that is what I'm thinking we have this this kind of like a I don't know like a not a bridge it's not a bridge how do you call it but this is not a castle there are some buildings down below us so it's not a moat or anything I don't think I don't know let's go Slovakia Slovakia calls my name let's go somewhere call go kosit it was okay it was CIA czechia Slovakia both look very similar so but my vibes were kind of in the right right area it was near berau what was the place ve ver Castle 13th century Castle let's have a look okay so this was a mo okay after all okay I I pictured it a bit different from what I saw uh is this the cost then I think so okay very cool very cool all right round number four another unofficial coverage big mountains oh what what do those signs say I think it says Peak I think it says Peak on that sign something Peak bunch of different Peaks okay so those signs point that's that Peak that's that Peak cool so English we don't have front plates at least is not on that card that we can see um okay so looking at the mountains looking at the lack of the plate I'm getting kind of what was the name of this mountain range where these the Rockies I'm getting kind of this this mountain range Vibe I am thinking well but these all the all of these states do have front plates in this vicinity the only one without front plates is Alberta of course it could be an out ofate car as well always that's an option but let's go okay yeah it was Wester was it Western Alberta or is it was it um BC oh it was BC I think okay it was British Colombia British Columbia's cars usually have front plates but it must have been like Alberton car or something but I'm pretty happy with that guess I yeah I'll take that oh oh gosh I can't say what it says but I can't see what it says but this surely is either us or Canada again oh I forgot to check what did we have behind us in the previous one I I'll I'll check it after this round um some fives the just the cars the plates are small the cars feel like the ones you would see in the US these pickup trucks a lot of them big cars one wait oh wait one one way you can't see behind my face let me move it we have this oneway sign um you get this oneway sign with the text I think it was us in Canada I think you got it without the one-way text if I remember correctly so should be us I think and no idea about the state I I don't see if we have or don't have front plates so let's go just by the V something like Illinois Springfield is what I'm thinking it was not Springfield it was Nebraska it was Lincoln oh was it like Lincoln Museum of American speed a center for racing and automotive industry Speedway Motors on the other side okay so that is the Museum of American speed and we have an old racing car okay I guess that that s is for Speed cool well that's that's really interesting please rev your engines that's what that sign said okay so lots of car fans around here okay what's with the result 16.8 th000 a little bit better than the first G uh first game let's have a look quick look at the fourth round how did that look again Visitor Center so we were in the Mount Robson visit visit Center here very nice and yeah we had we had different Peaks cinnamon Peak Clapper Horn Mountain cool cool cool again if you played along let me know in the comments how you did press that like button subscribe and on the right side there will be another playalong video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and you members for supporting

and today we are going to play a map called World Islands we've played some islands before but let's play them again I like them I hope you like them as well so let's go if you want to play along the links will be in the description if you don't know how to install the satellite view script I'll leave an info card up there all right uh let's go 10 minutes uh good luck everyone good luck uh got to wait for a moment for it to load and here we are here we are so let's close this well it's certainly an island all right so H okay well we are somewhere Coastal H not even in a city huh okay well lots of fields that I see so the Shadows where are the Shadows going Shadows are going to the north uh which would fit with Europe I'm kind of thinking this might be somewhere in Europe maybe can I find some City at least a small one this seems like a small small village or something definitely feels your opin which side are we driving on is my next question the quality is not the greatest here we have some dashed lines and looks like we're driving the right side so I'm thinking this might be Sweden Sweden has a lot of islands they have short dashes and they are driving on the right side and they are in the northern hemisphere so I think Sweden is our best bet because of those short lines in particular so we are looking for somewhere an island that which North part has this shape And Then There are some smaller ones through the North well let's uh let's have a look around Sweden do we find something like that the problem with Sweden is it has too many islands they have Islands everywhere I it's hard for me to understand how big the island is that we're looking for it's not massive but it's not super small either and most of the islands have a lot of small Islands going on nearby which I mean there are some here but it's really tricky to find anything that works I mean it might be Estonia maybe cuz they also have can have short dashes um but Estonia doesn't have many islands wait this is it okay thank gosh cuz cuz I started moving towards Estonia cuz cuz in Sweden all these islands seem too small and also do they just don't work with these smaller all islands all over the place so okay Estonia it is cool cool cool cool so we are very north of here um the roads don't align exactly as they should but I'll try to do my best so is this that road I think this is that road that we can barely see there so we would be somewhere right here okay okay we were more North I think something didn't align there but okay luckily it's still a 5k with 137 M off I'll take it though o this is an island must be a pretty big island then pretty big I think the map description said that there is a chance that there might be something like UK Ireland like the the big Islands as well um so I don't know my maybe let's let's have a look let's zoom in let's have a look which side we're driving on is it left or is it some other Island could be Japan of course as well it's it's a big island so which side are we no we're driving on the right side okay it's not UK or land uh looks like we have the European style trucks here or or is it or is it the long long front maybe it looks like we might have a yellow middle line so something like Puerto Rico or something Dominican Republic maybe I don't know if this map contains unofficial um countries unofficial coverage or not always going to be wary of that as happened in my previous satellite view video um H okay well do we have the yellow line or did I it's really it looks like there is certainly something yellow in between the lines definitely look yellow there so my first thoughts the Shadows are going to the north my first thoughts are yeah either Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic here cuz um they're both is on islands and they both have coverages and they both have yellow lines so yeah well let's see let's see does any of them have a city with like a wiggly wiggly road going through like that any Wiggly roads here not really I don't think so I don't think it's son of Juan does not look like it okay well let's see if Dominic can oh I guess it could be one of these smaller cities cuz there are some Wiggly roads here H is does this work does this work I think it actually might I think we have this this roundabout is a big big uh uh what's that's the name not a landmark but like a feat feature matching feature I don't know I can't remember English words but I think this matches pretty well so we are South of there south of there we have this road taking a turn here then it goes down down down and we are on this slight curve somewhere here is how do I pinpoint this I think this might be that road that we see here we have that um turn up there we see it so we're somewhere in between the two somewhere in between the two more towards the bottom side so somewhere I don't see that River I think okay I think the river is going through these trees I think if so then we are right here okay nice I'll take it 39 M good second round what is this now that's certainly an island again a lot of smaller islands around us so that might complicate things potentially hm well we are seems to be okay there is maybe some land or something down here uh let's see what do we see what do we have we have some roads quality is not the greatest my first initial thought was somewhere like South Argentina or Chile but uh I may be super wrong where is the sh okay the Shadows are going to the north it's not going to be Argentina or Chile it's in the northern hemisphere again so hm these houses all with gray roofs but there never be nor way this this wouldn't be swalo it's too green for swalo no well there isn't too much Greenery just a little bit here and there would this ever be swalo no no it wouldn't right no it wouldn't what would this be though cuz Norway was my first thought but not too many places really align and this doesn't feel super mountainous either are these Mountain mountains or what is this I guess a little bit mountainous I think they are some some hills but not snowy ones are these short dashed Lions again they kind of look like short dashed lies wait are we driving no we're not driving the left side no shot are we actually it actually looks like we're ding would this ever be Ireland no Ireland can have short yellow dashes on the sides of the road [Music] Ireland would explain gray roofs as well and white houses I'm starting to think this might be Ireland now the quality is not the greatest but it looks like we are driving the right on the left side and the dashes certainly could be yellow again hard to tell but I think they are slightly more yellowish than the central line okay I'm I'm pretty certain this should be Ireland Now in Ireland the west coast of Ireland does have kind of Island patches like this so yes let's let's see if we can align something find where this is exactly I think this is it isn't it we have this I don't know how to call it but Island and this is the bigger one so we'll be somewhere near Mill Mill we have so again these roads not really aligning EX exactly how they appear so I think this is the intersection here and we are this water reservoir isn't even on the map this road isn't on the map either so we just got to going to do our best and then hope for the best I think we're somewhere here is 12 meters nice okay okay I'm liking these locations they're not super hard but they're not they're also super easy kind of right that sweet spot I think oh this looks very interesting very very interesting lots of these Farm fields in different colors looks quite unique and this is an island first thought it was Japan but uh I don't know I might be super wrong again let's see looks so unique so unique maybe something like South Korea uh I think we are driving on the right side maybe South Korea maybe Taiwan ever maybe maybe I don't know I'm thinking Asia just getting Asia Vibes are these like rice fields or something I'm not sure they look like covered with water so may maybe what's the biggest city that we have have here maybe this one or this one they both seem pretty decently sized again Shadows going to the north so is somewhere in the northern hemisphere definitely driving the right side it looks like we might have yellow middle Lines no so maybe Korea then Korea definitely could have some yellow middle lines I don't I can't find anything else that would help me much well besides we okay we have this River going Inland here on the left side so let's have a look at South Korea first it doesn't look that patchy no that is not it this this area is quite vertical this this this so I I'll be paying attention to that it doesn't look like South Korea would align anywhere on the on the west coast um would Taiwan align it certainly has some similar like like Fields water Fields here at least so maybe maybe vertical I think this is it I think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay it is Taiwan well second second guess is the charm I went with South Korea first but but Taiwan was my second guess indeed so we are right East of this thingy on that main road uh if you know let me know in the chat what are these fields are they rice fields are they something else let me know and of course if you're enjoying these sat videos press that like button subscribe if you haven't all really really helps support this Channel and keep me making these videos where exactly are we we are in this trape and here is oh we uh we can see this canal I think yeah that's the canal we're slightly somewhere here 20 M I'll take that let's go and the fifth round O okay this one certainly doesn't look as Urban it looks quite rural actually well let's have a look at that road looks like all the road lines are white I believe could really tell which side we're driving on by that car that we had can't tell there either the Shadows are going to the north once again so again Northern Hemisphere could this be Russia maybe or something like that what is that which what is that and which side which way it's going can't tell um H yeah I would really love to know the driving side that I feel that would help a lot we have some houses here which feel more European than American to me at least I think maybe Finland or something maybe it looks like we are driving on the right side I think uh I'm very uncertain on this one is that a horse carriage or what what is that no we are driving the on the right side uh I have to go with that um so we saw some houses I think this is the biggest city that we have here with some blue bluish rofes is this Europe or is this America after all I'm actually not sure I could see this being you like us or Canada as well I'm very torn looks like we have some pickup trucks what well at least what appear to be pickup trucks from above so maybe because of that more America cuz they are more common in America I think that's looks like another pickup truck um yeah the more I see these all of this the more I'm thinking America after all um but where America has a pretty big Coastline both US and Canada and I don't think it's Mexico I think it's more north than that uh maybe somewhere here new found land or something this I'll I'll try to find this but I imagine this is going to be really tricky we don't have too much to go by here wait no no way well I thought it would be tricky and literally the first island I zoom in is the one well the reason why I zoomed in on this island is cuz we have a lot of these Lakes small lakes and and well there were a lot of small lakes here so made sense to me to to check it out and I think it aligns yeah I think that's it um okay well uh we have kind of looks like I don't know like a like a wolf I don't know like with an eye or like a like a Mouse some sort of an animal with like an open mouth and an eye an ear here uh anyways getting a bit uh distracted there so we are on this section of the road somewhere in the Mish yeah this is going to be really tricky to align well let's try to use this lake so we are east of of the middle of this section so somewhere yeah well basically where I have plunked somewhere here is let's see 11 M let's go perfect score let's go let's go for one more let's go for one more why not um okay link of course in the description again well won't be able to beat my first game but I I'll try to match it oh no this looks tricky uhoh okay I feel like I'm screwed here oh we are on a seems like a very very rural Island there are some small roads going here but yeah the Shadows are going to the north once more we might have some weather stations up here or something there seem to be quite steep Cliffs uh I don't I don't think that helps much though not to me at least I have no idea where this could be besides the fact we're in the northern hemisphere this could be anywhere Islands well one thought is maybe Indonesia somewhere another thought is maybe somewhere in americaas where would it be in Americas though thus far we've had coverage in only official countri official places so I think it probably should stay that way let's have a look at Indonesia maybe or Malaysia in Indonesia the drier parts are more towards here is because it looks quite dry so I don't know if that helps much nothing really aligns I don't think cuz the island shape at least seem seems to be quite unique with very narrow part in the middle H is it no it isn't kind of got excited a little bit there for a second I thought this is it but no we don't have this island at all that that sucks I thought we had it thinking maybe turkey somewhere but this doesn't really work turkey can be quite dry they don't have too many islands but they have some oh that's not really an island even most of these are Greek yeah I cannot find it I've looked over Americas I've looked over the Mediterranean I've looked over Indonesia I just don't don't know where this might be so I think I might as well send in something and uh yeah hope hope that this might work I really wonder where this is I feel like I've checked everything that it might be but well surely I've missed something let's see oo wow okay well that explains a lot yeah I did not check there I did not check west of California Channel Islands naal Park I I even knew that there is coverage there but yeah overlooked it that's that's annoying that is annoying okay what's next this one seems like another tricky one the first game felt relatively more or less easy the locations this is just rough what is this Shadows AG go again are going to the north we have a small town here with kind of grayish reddish houses wait are the Shadows going north no they're kind of going south why did they look North now now they appear to be going south yeah they're definitely going south uh okay so we are in the with these clouds um but yeah definitely going south so we're in the southern hemisphere on a on a beach a little bit heilly it seems which one of many many islands in the middle of the ocean could this be cuz um yeah this is going to be rough let's see if we can find something useful seems to be like a small island nation or or or small island in general well it's not the Christmas Island it's not the Coco Island we can we tell which side we're driving on probably no no way the streets are so small there are no Cars really cuz the towns are so small okay I don't know the driving side so American Samoa has some coverage but it doesn't look like this Hawaii is not this either maybe like wam or something m no and it's it's in the northern hemisphere as well this one look a little bit similar but I don't think it is it or is it it has this little bump and we do have a mosque I thought we we saw a mosque here somewhere or maybe it was the other town I thought I saw a mosque somewhere mosque would make sense and we yeah it is yeah we have this island here okay feel like I got super lucky here so was just scanning Island um okay we are on this bump somewhere like here we have this uh Resort and where we somewhere here 79 M that works oh that was a tricky one I'm glad I I figured that one out we have some town here at the bottom left corner some sort of a river and and got to keep in mind all of these are islands okay so would this be Europe or would this be something else I first thought was it looks a little bit European but uh let's see maybe it isn't do we have yellow middle lines kind of looks like we might have um so maybe the US Sur looks like we have some maybe some pickup trucks here again so yeah I'd be this looks like the yeah the American style truck with this large front so yeah I think this would be either us or Canada and this is an island huh so maybe something like new found land again or or or or Prince Edward Island or something there is a river going through would that a line not really no but we're looking for a river that has a city here that goes diagonal and has a city alongside it nothing seems to align here at least uh maybe are there any nothing would fit here I don't think so maybe there is something on the other side oh I don't know I feel like I've checked all the islands that it could be in North America surely it is somewhere in North America America but I I must be missing something obvious let's see it was here I checked here oh it's much smaller than I thought okay it was in the area that I was checking just it was too small I didn't didn't notice this part oh that's annoying that's annoying it's kind of in the right area but that was not enough okay something quite dry again we have what is this not sure but we have some a lot of roundabouts is what I see immediately a lot of roundabouts and we are driving on the right side very tropical a lot of palm trees we have some I don't know is that a taxi or what this seems like like a some tourist very touristy area this looks like a big Resort and then some other other hotels nearby so with the amount of roundabouts I'm thinking Europe cuz cuz Europe likes roundabouts they are safe safer than regular intersections but yeah very interesting looking Place uh what do we have do we have a stadium doesn't look like it's in a good shape yeah I'm thinking some some Spanish island or something canar somewhere there let's see if it works we have so we have the city towards the south of it we have some some um don't know is that a port or or some some ship loading thing I don't know um but yeah let's let's check canaries that's my first thought would that work somewhere here is this it it is okay yeah yeah nice so my first thought was the right thought here now our task is to align this um is it on this road that goes up or what is that is so that is some sort of a highway some sort of a road that goes in the mountains uh which one so so we are let's okay let's see we have this thingy down here and basically right north of that so we have this thingy right north of that would be this road how do we pinpoint this now we have some sort of a house here maybe that is on the okay we have to try to okay we have this big turn up here I think that's the one I think I'm really struggling with aligning this one so we have this huge turn up here that's definitely the one that's the big turn the big turn up there so we would be like 2 fifths of the way down somewhere here is somewhere there is now let's see we have the river crossing the the road crossing the river here so that might be it yeah yeah I think we are here okay took me a while but I think this is it oh 2 m let's go that's that's good that's very good ooh that's very green what we have here lots of some agricultural Fields what I see let's let's have a look at the city what is happening here are they build building a bridge or something what is looks like there is like a construction going on so maybe yeah they're building a bridge here looks very interesting okay so what's happening what do we see the sun the Shadows Shadows are going to the north a little bit so yeah should be Northern Hemisphere looks like we're driving on the right side looking at the road lines so okay so and island in the northern hemisphere we're dra on the right side is the middle and yellow it's getting really hard to tell these islands often times don't have the best quality of the coverage but I think the middle line is yellow it looks like it is so okay well if the middle line is yellow What could this be doesn't feel like us to me doesn't feel like I don't know what this feels like I don't know I don't have my vibes are not ringing here in any way maybe it is somewhere in the US somewhere far south or something would some somewhere here work know it's kind of flat and kind of patchy there so maybe that align somehow if even if it is there aligning this might be super tricky I'm kind of liking this guess but I I I I doubt I will be able to find to find where it is yeah I don't know I I've scanned the whole Coast it's hard to wait could it be somewhere here I don't think so for a moment looked a bit similar so I think I might leave it somewhere here anyways but yeah I I I see no point keeping scanning us Coastline maybe it even isn't even there um yeah let's see let's see uh yeah I wasn't scanning there well technically it was yeah Canada even okay I did I was not checking there it was in North America so I was right about that at least but this one felt like a really tricky round well 15.8 th000 definitely worse than the first game if you play it along let me know in the comments how you did H did you manage to beat my scores or not and on the right side there will be another play along satellite view video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ",

in a while and uh what's special about this map that each location has enough information so you should be able to 5K it find the exact location and as the description says it's intended to be played uh no moving so that's what we're going to do and I'll do my best to try to find the location let's increase the time limit to let's say 3 minutes cuz why not and no moving and yeah if you want to play along the links of course will be in the description let's get going what do we have here Baya Mei checkpoint so we're driving on the uh left side here I thought these were Colombian crosses for a second but no no no no no no this would be is this Indonesia or Malaysia I think with these strippy PS it would more Malaysia stripy sign post so and and the signs in general feel more Malaysian as well this blue blue and white combo and yellow and so where so Baya Meri are those cities we have some sort of a checkpoint here as well could this be Boro island or no I don't see any black stickers on the poles or black black plates so maybe this is Boro somewhere let's see if we can find Banda or Miri somewhere oh Miri here it is pretty big uh Miri okay Mei is here where is Banda oh maybe it is the checkpoint cuz it's a checkpoint towards brunai could that be the case Customs is it ever this roundabout I think it kind of aligns the the the exit is to our Northeast there is another exit to the west and one more there I think this round about allign and there there there checkpoint suai yeah it is sunai suai to that's the one okay I think this should be a 5k wait let let me just make sure I have bloned it in the right spot pretty much let's go let's go good start let's move on to the next one we have blue plates which immediately would make me think Sagal any signs so there are signs here aens deage Kimo rou which one is the city name here tuba d d it says D here on this side as well maybe D is maybe city name or oh it says the car here no the car are we in the car or again we're near a roundabout there is a big mosque in the distance let's see if we can find something what were the names here I'm guessing these might be city names MAA Das Med tuba guessing this this agency goes all over those places tuba is this tuba here tuba D tuba where is tuba tuba is here are we in Tuba though there is a great mosque here in the middle of tuba the great mosque is to our in the Southeast uh Southwest sorry would that fit are there any roundabouts here I don't see any roundabouts here Northeast of the great mosque so maybe it's a different mosque oh we're running out of time I just realized oh no h what should we go tuba say tuba this ISS the car there as well but I don't know I I would maybe be more willing to go tuba but I don't know I don't see any roundabouts to the north uh Northeast of the mosque uh where was it ah it was a different mosque okay okay there was the roundabout Southwest oh there is another Grand Mosque here yeah okay I guess that was the one that we saw H well at least I got the city right I'll take that at least better better than nothing 453 Road 453 in Israel we have yellow plates we have Hebrew on the signs so 453 where was that can we find it row numbers in Israel are pretty good for finding things 453 right here in the middle so that's 453 we have 40 here 450 3 and 40 where is 40 40 is down here is this oh this road is 40 so 453 and 40 meet here so is this the intersection does the road do the roads align going like that I think they do I think they do and I think we are right here very nice this is a quick one I like these these 5king rounds I don't know why I don't don't do the often press the like button if you like these these types of games and let me know in the comments so I know if you want to see more games like this in the future so we have Madrid to our kind of West Central sudad so the city center see do was like the city right or something like that so the city center 401 Madrid is through the and Madrid 401 401 420 funny number um I don't see 40 oh 401 n401 n 401 so what else do we have we have rondas Aila what is NV rondas Aila there the 41 end here 401 looks like 401 ends here is this the right one could there be another one n401 there shouldn't be right I'm not sure if this works though could there be another n401 somewhere NIV is here but this is NV we have N3 here N4 where is N5 God I'm I will run out of time before finding it 401 let's go somewhere I don't know what city this could be Toledo somewhere there's 401 here is oh it was in Toledo it didn't say 401 anywhere here I guess it was direction towards 401 I guess maybe yeah the 401 itself is a distance from here and I still don't see the N5 so yeah with those rad numbers this was a tricky one uh kiroki so we are in Greece Museum of Byzantine culture Thessaloniki architectural Museum archaeological Museum of Tessalon Niki so Tessalon Niki is all the way up here so we have a bunch of museums gallery of the Society of mecedonia studies Park Theater mosum of Byzantine culture okay so what oh we're on the coast that's that's good to know that's good to notice and the road is going like that so are we somewhere here is maybe the uh Direction so the road is going quite a long road and here it turns we have a big tower H it's literally right next to water it wouldn't be here right the the road wouldn't align with this street would it no it goes what it is there a tower there is a tower okay I guess it is this this street um so we are next to some some trees to our South so would be somewhere here is right we have Park oh the park starts here so we are on this intersection I guess that's a small Street I think nice very good so what were the results for this game not bad not a bad I was it one or two rounds it was two rounds where I got the city wrong well not yeah well kind of close but no cigar but I think it went pretty well let's do one more game let's do one more game I like this one we have oh I've seen this Tower before where was it was it Qatar or something 11 North is it is it Qatar is this car what is this car Alara ala sha that is UAE sha yeah Chara okay I guess this gu cuz in Qatar yeah I was thinking I don't remember seeing this car in guar so this is just UAE so 11 and 71 East so Al sharja is or the road turns I'm not sure which way it is but let's try to find Road 11 E11 here it is E1 E11 well E11 goes all the way through here so can we find d71 somewhere d70 73 72 2 71 d71 okay I think we're somewhere in this wonderful intersection roundabout whatever this monstrosity is um okay how do I pinpoint this we have big road going to the East and we are on a loopy loop that goes like that so we are on a loop D maybe this Loop d loop oh no wait which way are driving we driving in this direction is this antenna at the end of the car or the front of the car I'm not sure which which way are are we driving 50 seconds 50 seconds so we are this is the Inner Circle there are no no more like no more inner circles than this there are some more outside but this is the most Inner Circle so I think this has to be it I think so somewhere like here coffee store where is this right where is the coffee store here Cosmetics store in the middle of the the roundabout I highly doubt that these are correct uh let's see yeah we right uh that's a very interesting place for a coffee store maybe someone stands with a little cart very interesting Alo espresso uh forbidden to cross dollars the Plaza the what peace where are we where are we prohibido is this a border check velocidad Maxima no front plates no front plates is this a border checkpoint veloc Maxima wait where did you see velocidad Maxima wait oh we do have an antenna okay it is Puerto Rico huh okay I was thinking that I'm starting think starting to get Puerto Rico Vibes but it had noticed the antenna okay Puerto Rico so where would it be we have water to the east water to the north big bridge well sort of big bridge sort of big could it be somewhere here does that align is there there is some sort of a something checkpoint or whatever that thing is P San Juan does it say it's somewhere here maybe the the road turns more West I mean I think this works are there like loopd Loops somewhere here there might be Loop T Loops so I think this might be here I think it aligns pretty well there is a big city in the distance would make sense I guess there should be buildings there I think this is the best fitting bridge that I see so I think I'm I want to go right there oh it is still 5K nice that was a little tricky but I got it I'm happy with that what is this now Johan B plots stiena it is Austria right I think this the sun looks super Austrian we have German on oh yeah yeah these these these little thingies on the polls are Austrian in the flag color is very helpful to tell them oh and okay this is um Vienna with this number two number two where was number two I used to know this number two was the other side of the um river right I think number two was it somewhere here if I remember correctly oh we have a marina cluster Noor so we would be so what are the street names we had some hondel sky hondel sky road goes like that hondel Sky do we have hondel Sky somewhere let's make it bigger again hondel sky hondel sky okay do we see the we well we have railroad right next to us that could be really helpful where is the railroad was this number two okay I'm not 100% sure anymore there is railroad here there's number 14 I saw 14 here is this a road number 14 I thought it might have been kilometers hondel Sky okay here it is oh maybe it was 20s the other side of the river gosh I should really refresh my Vienna District know so it said Yan something Yan bomb plots is the next street over fredrich Angel don't know what do we have we have a Opel service here how do we find this do we see any Opel Services here oh no we're running out of time that is not good Mar I don't know oh it was more south ah there was the Yan bom plot yeah I didn't get that far south to check it out oh there is the Opel Opel thing as well ah close close close oh wait did we I missed this this bridge somehow oh gosh that was silly I somehow completely overlooked the big bridge that we had right next to us okay well close but but a little bit annoying that I didn't 5K it let Grand large interesting is that a Welsh flag kind of looks like it we have a French French plates looks like French language as well what does it look like a Welsh flag two languages a okay where would this be P what is the phone I can't I can't see what's the phone number there I do not recognize that flag either on the ship what do we see here breast we have breast breast is somewhere here yes I knew was somewhere Coastal so we have breast to to the kind of Northwest camper o oer camper here is quimper quimper oh that's a q quimper is to the same direction as breast where would we be one of these towns are we somewhere here L Grand law what is what is that breast are we in breast maybe we are what's the what's the what's the direction of the road goes like that we have the the boats there some more buildings to the South as well somewhere here what's the what's the road now Road name de danan danan danan we are okay I found danan we have what is that road does it say BL BL BL yes okay perfect and we are right here is prominade right before Oh here is I guess I guess this might be a Street then second Peron Aon nice what was it in two languages let me know if you know um interesting cuz there was French and some other maybe like a regional language I'm not sure what now uh we have what's the language L what is the what is that language gosh which language L with the the thingy isi oh no what are the plates can we see the plates we have one blue strip one blue strip one blue strip well those are not French plates not Portuguese plates not Italian plates so is it Spanish maybe we can't move around so this is basically the only thing that we have is slandy which one of those is a city name cuz none of them really ring a bell we are seems to be a pretty large city nearby to the north isi M there is a big uh whatever what was it called oh God I forgot that does look like a Spanish sign as well but but but but but what would it be what city wouldn't be would it be Madrid there's a big city to the north wouldn't be Barcelona that wouldn't work maybe Granada would that work I don't recognize any of those maybe I can find quickly notice oh and we are running out of time I I I'll keep it in oh was Barcelona what oh M There It Is Well you really need to zoom in to find it m yakel de Well yeah if I had zoomed in I would have found itm interesting looking from above I didn't see that green part so I thought okay that there isn't much Greenery south of barcelon so I discounted it oh I shouldn't have yeah that was a rough round I felt I feel like that was the most difficult one um in these two games but let me know in the comments how you did if you played along press that like button and on the right side there will be another playong video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rester day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video

going to play a map called it's a long way down views from above B so we'll be standing on top of big buildings Towers wherever and we'll have to guess where we are based from there mostly unofficial coverage uh mostly photospheres so let's see let's see how it goes play along links as always will be in the description if you want to play along let's say minute 30 per round and we can turn keep them moving on in case you can move somewhere but I imagine probably you won't be able to so very beautiful view some sort of a view Tower very touristy place what do we what does it say here we have some Korean huh okay we have some Korean language photo line photo line so somewhere in Korea South Korea I would imagine so very beautiful where would could this be a view Tower near North Korea maybe maybe everyone's looking at North Korea in the distance maybe I don't know just a thought H I don't see anything else really but yeah let's go let's go South Korea near the border maybe somewhere cuz I know it can be hilly there so I think that would [Music] Advantage is the could it be this park maybe is there is another park there so maybe this is the big Park that we see and this is that smaller one to our left would we be maybe we are somewhere here I'm not sure but I think maybe is there a park in that direction can we okay we don't really have time to to to uh move around too much but I'm I'm pretty happy with I was thinking maybe we are somewhere up here but uh let's see okay we were a little bit West also maybe this was the park that we saw uh but still pretty good pretty close it was Tokyo indeed very very beautiful cities from above I have to say I really want to go to Tokyo visit I've heard it's a good time to visit um so maybe I should maybe I should I was thinking I should travel somewhere this year maybe it will be Tokyo now where this is lot of high buildings in the distance the architecture definitely feels Asian with these these roofs but but but but what where would this be China would this be something else Japan maybe again the plates I can't really see they might be blue maybe I know in China you get blue plates but really hard to see if they are blue or not we definitely have some red flags which maybe are Chinese but there are other colored Flags as well so maybe it's just a red flag I think China is my best bet here though I can't see which side we're driving on could this ever be Hong Kong maybe let's go near Hong Kong like Shenzhen maybe okay it was not Shenzhen it was jaia quing but still pretty close guess well relatively speaking okay a night photosphere Bank something Bank some sort of a bank we're driving on the right side H there isn't too much to see the quality isn't that great Century Bank or something it says I don't know where this is the the road lines all look white quality is really not that good would this ever be us but I don't know the lines are white though the streets seem to be very grid like and we're driving on the right side so even though the lines seem to be white maybe it's just because of the camera or the lighting in the night this feels quite American to me from what I see but oh gosh I don't know let's go ever Chicago or something or or or no probably not Chicago but I don't know where this is it was us oh it was then very I didn't know which city it was but it was us though so I'm glad I got the country right maybe there is some famous Denver Towers somewhere around which I didn't know if you recognize it let me know in the comments but what is this now what is this some sort of a hole with trees what this is confusing what is this we have a bunch of uh yellow lines I think we are driving on the left side right is this Japan again can we get down here oh will this be Hong Kong or Japan the language that I see looks more Chinese to me than Japanese but I know they they share some symbols we are driving on the left side so wait what were the back plates ah we had some back plates I think they are white cuz in in in Hong Kong they would have yellow back plates okay it was Japan yeah it was Japan nigata it was okay I didn't know the city I just I just knew it didn't look like Tokyo but okay it was nigata the results I think I did pretty well I thought the 19.7k pretty good I think uh let me know how you do if you play along and press that like button so I know you enjoy these play along videos but uh let's play one more game Let's Play One More ooh what is this is that the saint Paul Cathedral is this London oh I think it is London is is it St Paul's Cathedral or no I think we have London I in the distance there as well so St Paul's Cathedral is somewhere here is oh here St Paul's Cathedral found it uh so and we are we can see London n in the distance so I think the compass is sort of right sort of right so if we have St Paul there and London I there we would be somewhere here is this isn't sky is this Sky Garden maybe this is Sky Garden building but just not the top of because I've been to Sky Garden at the top very beautiful uh skyscraper at the very great views from above and I think it was free of charge you just need to book your visit in advance uh maybe this is from the sky Garden just not from the top floor maybe I'm not sure cuz I think the angles would align so let's see okay it was not Sky Garden but was pretty close was a different uh High building pretty good guess though good start now what is this we are driving on the left side once again is this Japan definitely looks very Asian Hotel okay I got to the floor ground floor this is definitely Japan but where can we find any phone numbers phone numbers can be helpful I don't know the pole metal thingies I know you can use those as well 08 is that the area code 089 08 would be quite Southern evi that's a long word okay if it is 08 then I would be in clined to go south okay there was 08 I couldn't remember I guess there might might be 09 here already Matsuyama okay still I'm pretty happy with my guess there not too bad at all okay we are on some sort of a tower Lighthouse maybe even it looks like would Mak sense cuz we are coastal these pickup trucks feel very American from the first glance some other cars don't look super American though okay we have yellow middle line so yeah I think this should be the us or potentially Canada maybe but uh H we have pretty flat looking landscape oh does the uniform maybe have something useful I I can't see anything on the uniform pretty flat and Coastal we can't trust the compass can't trust the the compass where would it be so flat maybe somewhere here near wiling Wilmington looks like it may be kind of flattish in that area and it is definitely Coastal let's see ooh okay not bad at all it was oh W it was there hat Hatteras Island Cape Hatteras Lighthouse that one was interesting oh I wasn't thinking there at all oh I guess maybe if we didn't have the lighthouse in the way we could have seen water in the opposite direction too that would have helped if I had noticed it maybe you could see it I just didn't notice uh something aob Jacob ather maybe Robert John John Jacob where is this we have yellow lines again is this us or Canada once again this wouldn't be Europe we have a quite hilly area I'm thinking maybe more West Coast now we have a bridge um could we be somewhere Seattle is there a bridge could it be somewhere here near this bridge ever maybe or one of these Bridges up here I'm thinking somewhere here could it be Vancouver maybe even no well certainly not this city but H I think I'm happy with where I have bloned it now somewhere down here near Tacoma maybe let's see ah okay well it wasn't Tacoma but again I'm not too far off kind of the aoria the aoria column that one was o wait is this wait wait wait what is this this feels very is this Stockholm the that um that that that theme park in Stockholm I think they had like a top like this I haven't been to the theme park but the city definitely looks like Stockholm and I think it very much reminds me of it so I think it's Stockholm yeah so the theme park itself is right uh where is Circus no Baltic Sea science in there where is the Vasa Museum no where is the the theme park oh my God I I I know how it looks from where to find it from the land but where exactly is it from above somewhere here oh here Eclipse oh yeah I missed this logo theme park yeah yeah there was it was stom I missed on one point a 229,000 pretty good I'm happy better than the first game I will gladly take it let's do one more let's do one more game challenge I hope I have made the previous one challenge hopefully I didn't forget what is this New York well the the booklet the magazine says New York are we in New York it certainly looks like we might be certainly looks like a big city that could be New York we see some water out the window there definitely is some water in New York so somewhere here looking to Huds Hudson River or maybe we're the other side looking at East River I don't really know but I think let's guess somewhere in New York oh it was more south we were looking at Hudson River but uh yeah well I'm still pretty good guess I think think oh what is this looking down nice to see wait nice is it nice see you nice to see you to see you nice what we are some sort of a glass floor here the Blackpool Tower wait where is Blackpool Blackpool Blackpool is here yes okay the black pool Tower I hope this is the right black pool are there any other other black pools the big one is this the big one steel roller coaster no this is not a steel roller coaster the big one the Blackpool Tower I don't see any Blackpool Towers here though but is it is Coastal so that would check out I think this has to be that Blackpool I just can't find the Blackpool Tower here on the map Solaris Center yeah I don't see it St an's Beach let's just keep it somewhere here oh I was literally about to click there I was literally clicking here in the center damn it I missed out on 10 points oh there is the Black hoole Tower dungeon even oh was like a half a second too late with my click O Okay this looks pretty cool where is this somewhere definitely Coastal somewhere pretty rich looking would this be Dubai or something like that oh I'm not sure the AR Ure the colors giving me Middle East Dubai Vibes we can definitely move around inside the apartment or hotel room I don't think that would help us too much looks very fancy wait there is an American flag here okay it wouldn't be Dubai huh uh something like wait what then somewhere in Florida maybe Miami ever I don't know maybe somewhere in Miami I am not sure at all where would there be so many water is and canals somewhere here maybe there seem to be a lot of waters in canals it was there it was Miami yeah okay I'm glad I noticed that American flag there otherwise I would would have been way wrong with the UAE um but I guess it could could be a country without official coverage at all cuz this is all unofficial okay we are on a some sort of a parce wheel I don't think it's it's not a London Eye what is it then the driving side I think we're driving on the left side down there would this be Japan again maybe I don't see any language anywhere but maybe we have some water doesn't really feel like Tokyo but Kobe saporo no it wouldn't be saporo we need quite a lot of water Kobe I saw Osaka has a lot of water let's get somewhere here is there's a lot of water around us so I think Osaka could be a good guess oh wait what's Tokyo Yokohama okay interesting okay well very much outskirts of Tokyo I think Yokohama counts as part of Tokyo still right I think um so yeah very much out scared that's why I didn't really feel like it yeah Tokyo is huge now what is this we in some sort of again High building with some helip pads very big city once again on the coast which side are we driving on are we driving on the left side again is this Japan again we're like getting Japan half the time I think this is Japan again which city is the question have some [Music] mountains so we got Osaka again this time would there be mountains like that nearby there seem to be some mountains nearby so maybe yeah let's go there okay not too bad not too bad it was te takas takamatsu takamatsu it was so in toal 23.2 th000 uh yeah 232,000 my best score yet uh pretty good I would say let me know again in the comments how you did press that like button and on the right side there will be another playong video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful reer day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ",

today we're going to play a map called bridges of the world so yeah I'm excited let's see how it goes if you want to play along the links will be in the description and you also need a satellite view script installed I'll leave an info card up there on how to do it okay let's get going let's see what do we get all righty then something Coastal where is the bridge so this is the bridge not a very huge bridge but it gets the job done I guess we have a roundabout here so which side are we driving on it looks like we're driving the left side here looking at these Road markings so my first thought would be first of all it felt very European initially uh the Shadows are going to the South okay maybe not your European after all I guess it would be Australia or New Zealand then if the Sun is to the north and we're driving on the left side and it looks like this I would go yeah New Zealand would be my first start we have some hills here some mountains to the kind of Northeast let's have a look at the city what do we see here not a very big city but looks looks nice from above at least there are some palm trees here I think so all right so got to keep that in mind where would this be so we have some mountains but they don't seem super high I don't see any Snowy Peaks so could this be the northern Island in New Zealand somewhere here or no maybe not nothing really aligns for New Zealand with water going to the Southeast like that could it be Australia somewhere maybe somewhere near Brisbane would that work does no that does that's not it I can't find it neither in New Zealand nor Australia I even checked South Africa I don't think it is though but I I I checked it but uh it wouldn't be so mountainous and then green here there is a small airport here like an a air field but it's very small I don't think it helps us too much maybe maybe it's helps to spot it somehow wait is this it oh it is it it is it oh my God finally this text obscured the little Peak a little bit but yeah it is it for sure okay finally I somehow had overlooked it before but okay I'm glad I found it so that's the city geese born the bridge this is the bridge yes okay I'm glad I found it so we would be hard to pinpoint this one but I think we would be somewhere here is let's go let's go I'll take that let's move on next one oh okay o okay this is more difficult oh no oh no no not good my first side was maybe Brazil but um oh gosh let's let's have a closer look we do have a bridge indeed we have some cars the quality is not the greatest which said are we driving on here it's really tough to see it kind of looks like we might be driving on the left side here I think that's a one big line looks like they are standing on the left side of the street huh so if this is driving on the left side what would this be where are the Shadows going Shadows going to the north huh so it would be in the northern hemisphere interesting I'm really not sure what this would be there are some Sandy roads some paved roads can't really see the road lines here that those might help figuring out where this might be are we driving on the left side I'm not so I can't tell it's so important to figure out but I can't really tell for sure I think we are I think we are driving the left side I I'll have to go with that assumption now what would this be driving the left side Northern Hemisphere not entirely get European Vibes really I don't think it is Europe driving on the left side so what what remains something like Thailand Indonesia Malaysia I don't really see blue roofs oh there's one but there is one River going through here oh could this be ever Bangladesh or India India is an option I just realized okay I don't think Bangladesh really works with that River in that direction I think currently my best guess would be India but my confidence is not high there are some rivers that go in in the general direction I haven't found anything that fits really well though but that's the best I have have yeah I I don't really have a good guess on this one I think let's just make a guess and see how how wrong am I okay it was Bangladesh after all oh okay that River was super small really really hard to notice okay there was this one small river that was going the right way okay so I wasn't too far actually India wasn't that bad of a guess after all was Bangladesh okay well was in the right area so I'll take that I will gladly take that so we have another River very green location what's up with this city very gridlike is the first thing that I notice so maybe somewhere in Americas would this ever be us or not really let's have a look which side are we driving on where are the Shadows going all that good stuff looks like we have North American style trucks these these ones with a kind of big front is in Europe you would have a smaller front so this would be somewhere in in the U well maybe I don't know maybe us oh it says only only left so we have we have English we have North American trucks Shadow's going to North this is either us or Canada yellow middle lines as well everything fits with us or Canada grid grid uh Street as well so now we have to figure out where in the US or Canada this is there is an airport here pretty big one I would say and another airport what is the city the city I mean it's not small but it doesn't look that huge we have two airports very close to each other maybe there a lot of transfers happening here or something would what would that indicate maybe somewhere more towards Central us I don't know would this be Mississippi River or or this is so big would be really hard to find anything here I can try to follow Mississippi and uh see maybe something fits not really having high hopes Canada has a lot of lakes but not that many rivers I think there are some but way more Lakes maybe there's so many airports cuz there seem to be a lot of warehouses and stuff so maybe like instead of people flying in and out different like products are flown in and out a delivery Hub or something here I have no idea where it would be though I've I've checked quite a lot of rivers that I could find but it's tough to really find something unless we know the state or something closer no I was thinking Jefferson City looks a bit similar in terms of the alignment but it's it's not it yeah doesn't look like we're finding it I'll keep it somewhere here Central Missouri oh whoa it was that Coast though wow okay I wasn't thinking that cast Savannah okay interesting didn't I guess sense yeah that River enters the ocean here from what I could see it didn't get didn't see at least that the ocean is that close that would have helped that would have definitely helped well was right about the country but yeah the US is such a big one hard to find next looks like it could be European but let's have a closer look looks quite European from what I see the roofs and everything oh I always struggle with the countries though that's a regular football field but with no writings I'm thinking something like Southern Germany or Austria I don't know ever Denmark I don't know let's let's have a look let's have a look they are definitely driving on the right side here a few solar panels there on the roofs we have some yellow pedestrian Crossings I always forget where do you see those CU you don't really see many of them in regular street view so you would think I would remember where there are yellow ones but I don't I feel like I've seen very similar intersection in one of the previous satellite view videos but where was it so annoying that I can't remember there seem to be some tram tracks or something here on the on in the middle of the road oh what are these what what are these whatever these are look from the above looks quite cool I think Germany would be my main guess from what I have seen seems to be like a pretty big city with this River the bridge itself well that's a bridge I don't know what else to tell tell about it is this like a dam or something what's happening here so let's zoom in on Germany some bigger cities and see if there is a river like that going through so the river goes from west to east then it takes a big loop very unique shape and then goes vertically through the city the shape is definitely very unique so if we spot it should be very clear that we have found it Germany doesn't seem to work I've checked a few other countries they also didn't seem to work Switzerland would be oh it is burn okay so somewhere at the back of my mind there was a thought was it Switzerland with yellow pedestrian crossing signs lines the answer is yes apparently it is it's okay hopefully now I actually remember all right so we have this little knob here so is this the bridge that we have I think so so we're somewhere here is nice very good let's go round number five oh okay well this looks tough there is nothing here is there even even a bridge where is the bridge is that that tiny thing a bridge okay zero chance I'm fighting this I'm telling you right off the bat there's nothing here a forest and some hills these Shadows are going to the north these Shadows are going to the South what is happening here the most Shadows of the clouds seem to be going south so let's trust the majority so the sun should be to the north so we should be in the southern hemisphere I think and it looks like the sh the shadowy side from the hill on the hills are also kind of more on the would indicate the sun is to the north what's with this city we have some blue roofs oh this is a big hill you can see how close it comes to our eyes is looks so cool anyways um I think we are driving on the left side but it's the quality is not the greatest it's really tough to tell I would be thinking Indonesia maybe here any kind of those kind of vibes I don't think there is a big point in trying to find this cuz there's nothing to find by The Vibes it seems like it could be Indonesia maybe so that's what I would go that's where I would go there are some small rivers here and there so let's let's go with solo I see but no real clue Sri Lanka okay we were driving on the left side we were in the northern hemisphere after all well pretty close to the equatorial line so it could mess things up but yeah the Shadows were kind of tricky on this one yeah that was a difficult round if you are playing along let me know in the comments how you are doing in these challenges and press that like button so I know you enjoy these satellite V videos so I make more of them uh And subscribe if you haven't I really appreciate that and it helps out the channel very very much uh okay so in this game we got well I got 15.4 th000 points well the first and fourth round were obviously the best but I'm not too mad about the um uh Indian one and American one was okayish as well but okay let's do one more let's do one more game let's see let's see what we get oh something Coastal I like Coastal in these satellite view videos my first thought was UAE cuz like the angle would kind of work looks very dry we have some mountains to the east with these mountains to the east I would maybe think somewhere up here maybe not the B Al Kaa does that it does work yeah it is it perfect well that is a quick one cuz yeah the M the mountains gave it away for me that it could be up here cuz it is very M like youe has mountainous East Side basically all right so we're exactly on that Bridge let's block it right in the middle very nice good start okay oh this looks like a huge City oky doy huge City Big River where are we this okay this is Pittsburgh well I like when American football stadiums have big city names sometimes they could be visiting like um away city names I think I've had it happen before but surely this wouldn't be that case it says Pittsburgh on multiple different coverages what are they doing here are they like s like throwing sand all over the place for some reason it looks like they're throwing something on the field some sand or whatever that is let me know if you know oh and we have a baseball field now now my challenge is to remember where Pittsburgh was cuz I don't remember I like the hockey team oh here okay by zooming in right right on it uh all right perfect and it is this bridge down here smithf Smithfield Saint oh Smithfield Street bridge I thought it was Saint at first Smithfield Street Bridge not a very original name just named after the street that connects to it uh and it's right in the middle right in the middle very nice great start for the game let's let's hope it stays that good well this doesn't look as easy at all um how big is the bridge not very big on the smaller side we're definitely driving on the right side here judging by the road markings and this feels very European to me very very European houses European roads everything just feels European to me here big football field unfortunately no no city names this time Europeans should also start writing with big letters the city this is some sort of an indust industrial real Zone up here which European country could this be not really getting too much info looking at the city itself does it say taxi or is it just a pedest I mean might be just a pedestrian crossing the quality difference is like literally night and day H I wonder which is the old and which is the new coverage yeah I think I'll focus on this side or for me to tell where in Europe I think this would be maybe like Poland or somewhere around there bus have the these these bus lanes bike Lanes the bike Lanes maybe more West like uh Belgium Netherlands I don't think it's the Netherlands maybe Belgium so there is a small is River going through the city diagonally okay well let's scan some European cities okay not Belgium Germany maybe that's a possibility doesn't look like it's Poland chechia Slovakia maybe maybe even more south than that oh we are running out of time unfortunately didn't check all the countries that I kind of wanted to check but but let's leave it somewhere in this vicinity uh I'm not sure let's see what it was I literally checked Belgium first literally okay everything was much smaller than I thought it was oh my God yeah I did not check that place yeah no shot I did not check this city at all looked too small to be it ah so annoying that it literally checked Belgium first and then eliminated it right off the bat excluded it and moved on all right so what is this this is interesting this is interesting um first there was maybe chile because of like the alignment some like pretty dry looking with water to the big water to the West what do we have we have a pretty big city here on these these islands so we are driving on the right side yes the bridge pretty big well yeah connecting the islands so where are the Shadows going Shadows are going slightly south or maybe very Central maybe very slightly South but but very slightly indeed okay does anything in Chile actually fit I can't remember Chile having such like like a I don't know how you call this this strip of land that looks like this can't remember seeing Chile having that where would this be yeah Chile doesn't have it or could it be here in Mexico they have strips like that is there a city somewhere along there are some small towns or whatever these places are but is there a city that would fit yeah Nothing fits Nothing fits where would this be ever up here oh is it actually I was thinking it's not the car the car doesn't work but maybe yeah somewhere up here I remember there was some City up here in Sagal but I had no idea if it would fit or not but not too many options with the coastline like ocean to the West like that okay so I'm I'm glad I found this pretty much in the center a little bit to the left somewhere here is let's go let's go that's a good round and round number five looks like we might be on the on the coast I don't know it's an ocean or a big sea but on the coast for sure lots of Red Roofs very red roofs very very red Rubes doesn't feel European I don't know what does it feel like but not European where are the Shadows that's that's that's the first thing to check slightly to the South okay so we would be in the southern hemisphere most likely which side are we driving on quality is so bad I can't tell we might be driving on the left side is that a yellow middle line or not if the quality was a little bit better it would help so much if I had to guess I would say left side driving on the left side but I'm still not sure I've looked at this road for so long and can't really tell and it just stops okay well okay that seems interesting such a big road and just it ends here you have reached the destination what are the road lines I think we are driving on the left side here I I I feel so if we are driving on the left side and the Shadows are going south it seems so and I thought we might have some yellow middle lines so maybe something like Thailand no water to the north doesn't make much sense for Thailand unless it's somewhere here well I guess it's not Thailand after all what else could it be I can never remember where do they have those super red rofes in Asia driving on the left side wouldn't be Sri Lanka would it no doesn't fit yeah for sure we are driving on the left side this car looks very much driving on the left side where though where though the Northern Hemisphere this wouldn't be Japan no shot my best guess would be either Malaysia or Indonesia maybe more Malaysia nothing really aligns I don't think I'm very much interested where this is cuz I feel like I've checked everything I thought was plausible and nothing really works yeah I'm not sure yall let's let's change it to Malaysia I don't know it was Indonesia it was Indonesia after all I checked it but well oh yeah here it is yep well now I see it I scanned all over I somehow missed it well this one was even though it was was Coastal I felt like it wasn't that easy to find well at least it wasn't for me but let me know in the comments how you did if IAL score 19. 6,000 so better than the first game I'll take that and well yeah I'll not too bad overall on the right side there will be another satellite view video I think you will enjoy and huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/fTIS4zCrg6NjSuWI", "data/images_geopeter/xWomurR3L0A1CPO2"], "locations":

"https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/cKTVtYOqFXbxEWoW"], "transcript": "hello and welcome back to another geoguesser Play Along video and today we're going to play a map called the lowest points of each country this was a map I believe suggested by one of my viewers a while ago uh and finally I'm getting to it eventually so in this map there are country lowest points but countries where the ocean is the lowest point are not included as well as countries with no coverage in the lowest point those are also not included so that's good to know this map is suggested to be played in no no move or nmp set modes so let's play it in no move let's a time set the time limit to minute 30 the links in the description as always so let's get going let's get going ooh oo okay this is an interesting location what is this some sort of a church very interesting one okay some mountains big mountains here feels like maybe abandoned buildings very interesting place where would this be I'm not even sure about the continent right now what is the language what is the language it's not Ethiopian no would this be Georgian no I don't think so Armenian maybe I think it looks quite Armenian and I think the nature would fit I think the people look Armenian some might maybe it was Armenia let's go so the lowest point is up here apparently I just bloned in the middle I I wouldn't know I wouldn't have guessed up there cuz there are mountains there but okay let's move on Good Start that's I'll take that ooh this looks green my first that was could be baltics maybe even but let's see if we find any clues what are these poles I have no idea well there aren't too many Clues here are there I don't think we can I don't think the description said anything about the aligned Compass I think it just said that the author has tried to choose high quality locations this feels kind of Baltic but maybe not that doesn't have to be so I'm thinking maybe something nearby like bellarus I don't think it's lvia so maybe like Lithuania bellus I'm thinking somewhere around there let's go maybe bellarus near is this a Riv I guess this is a river looks like a river at least uh are there any rivers in bellarus I don't see any would this be Ukraine maybe oh no it was bellarus it was bellus oh there is the river nunas got a bit lucky there I feel cuz I did not know it was bellarus but I'll take it o okay so we have yellow outer lines driving on the left side this would be southern Africa somewhere now which country would this be lutu maybe we have these bare mountains with no trees when I see that I am thinking lutu the lowest point in l where would that be whole Leu is quite mountainous the lowest one maybe appears maybe somewhere up here is okay down here it was lutu so I'll take that this is a good game oh wait what is this is this a big lake what is the flag Austria is this Austria some big lake in AUST Austria would this ever be what other flag could that be if not Austrian Red white red well it's not lvan could we be where where is the this like maybe no maybe would make sense for it to be the lowest point there are land in all the there is land in all directions so maybe we are somewhere like in the middle of that that Lake I don't see any any other Clues really that would help just that flag so let's see okay pretty good pretty good my first blon was spot on basically all right what now very interesting Castle oh is that like a movan flag or andoran flag is that a EU flag or well this doesn't really look like Andor so I'm thinking maybe mova maybe it's not an EU flag then maybe it's some other flag it looks like like a Romanian flag with something in the middle should make sense for it to be mova or would it be Romania if that's a is that a u flag maybe it is a Romanian flag with some some Crest in the middle or something or maybe it just looks like there is something in the middle maybe there isn't cuz Romania I feel would make more sense with the EU flag than mova cuz mova is not part of EU Romania is so I'm kind of leaning towards Romania because of that but we'll see we'll see the lowest point maybe somewhere closer to the to the Black Sea somewhere is let's go bit closer to mdova just in case it was actually mdova it actually was mova interesting oh that was Soroka Fortress so it was the movan flag well it looked like it might be just that EU looking flag threw me off but maybe it was some some local local flag or something still 23,000 that's a really good score I'll take that uh but let's play one more let's play one more and if you are enjoying these player along videos press that like button it really helps out the channel and then lets me know that you like that and yeah and let me know in the comments how you are doing if you play along I am always interested in hearing your scores what is this what is this well this doesn't look very European off the bat I was thinking either Asia or somewhere in Americas but I don't really know this architecture I'm not really good at architecture but the color tones maybe make me think more somewhere in americaas but I wouldn't know we have big river I think this doesn't have to be an official country that has official coverage it could be something like Nicaragua shall we go Nicaragua maybe it's a big lake I think let's go Nicaragua why not I don't have a better guess anyways uh it was oh it was Paraguay oh okay well it was South America not not North America so yeah not not a good start not a great score but it was a tough round I thought repos sto alril so I think we have some Spanish here would this ever be Mexico or not try try I'm not sure this is somewhere Spanish speaking do we see any electricity counters at all I don't is that an electricity counter hard to really see I'm thinking maybe this is something in Central America yeah no no clue really let's go somewhere in [Music] Honduras oh it was Venezuela near the lake makes sense not the greatest guess but could be way worse was kind of right about the area sort of this is a pretty location very well quite Healy the architecture feels very European these houses feel kind of Slovenian maybe or Austrian something like that or German we have some trins going [Music] here ooh kind of think thinking Slovenia oh do we see any bards maybe no I don't think we do if that's a Bard then I can't really see it the signs yeah we're we're a bit too far oh what is that sign 733 I can't tell those those bards don't look super familiar what is that sign wait what is this I'm I'm so confused it was checky what those are some really weird signs there interesting I went I ended up going with Bosnia that wasn't a good guess I should have stuck with sloven because of the architecture I was just I just panicked CU I didn't recognize those signs stop signs here we have some kind of Blocky polls stop this pole feels kind of Belgian to me am I crazy I don't know about this boss Bust Stop the pole looks Belgium Belgian the house the architecture could be Belgium I could see that so I think let's go Belgium where could maybe there be a low Point somewhere or it be closer to the coast somewhere maybe okay yes it was closer to the coast okay good gu it was Belgium nice I thought that pole looked qu quite belgi Belgian this looks quite like popcorn but I don't think it is looks like a lovely sunset but where I don't have a good guess can't see that house well I feel this could just as easily be Europe or America or something completely else I think I would go Europe like I don't know Poland or we just had czechia so it's not going to be czechia um Hungary maybe let's go Poland maybe let's see it was fron interesting okay I wasn't thinking France there but I I can see that easily that was very generic looking round this one did not go nearly as well as the first game but again if you enjoyed it press that like button let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another playalong video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest for day be

view locations by D City I think we've played this map before but let's play it again cuz I think it was a really good one so in this one we have as the title suggest unusual locations all official so and it's looks to be really hard so let's see let's see what kind of locations we have the links challenge links will be in the description if you want to play along let's set it to let's say minute and a half per location and let's say I mean with moving it if it will be possible I imagine in some locations it might I don't if it's official then it should should be with moving anyways but we'll see okay okay we are on some sort of an island here I wonder where we have some cannons an anchor I don't think can we oh maybe we can see the sign I imagine that sign might have some more context The Residency okay maybe not maybe not this might be some sort of an old fortress or or like a I don't know doesn't look like a fortress or or like a lookout maybe I don't know on some Island this is official where could this be the sun is right in the middle that's not helpful at all we have some roads oh gosh where would this be looks very tropical which side are we driving on where did that no entry sukuna what is sukuna what I don't know oh no this is bad where would this be looks like we're driving the left side uh Bermuda oh okay Cape Town Robin Island m well explains where the driving on the left side I would have thought that sun would have been more North CU it looked very Central that one was a tough tough start that was a oh no what is this my first start was maybe would this ever be Adamstown maybe not what what does this say baradia barong what are these symbols these umls kind of looks maybe Hungarian but this one doesn't feel very Hungarian I don't know I don't know what those languages are looks looks Hungarian maybe would this be somewhere in Hungary possibly some some natural Trail through the forests and mountains I don't think we'll find any more useful info the houses that we see could be Hungarian I don't know maybe uh let's go I don't know let's go kind of central maybe a bit more West or maybe this park could this be Park oh it was this park it was Hungary yeah nice interesting that was a tricky one I don't think I had seen that uh Hungarian Park before all right we are in a church some sort of a church now very beautiful one very grandos but where would this be can we find some language Maybe that might be helpful and these booklets can we read anything music meets something monster monster Monster where was monster monster I've heard of Moon Moon here it is okay fine found it eventually uh is there a big church here this looks like a big church at least that's the first one I noticed would that fit in terms of the layout it seems to be yeah maybe I think it might might fit any other churches maybe this one oh maybe this one yeah this is bigger astronomic is there like an I guess if there is an astronomical clock it would be on the outside but some sort of astronomical clock I think yeah let's go here excuse me it was Basel BOS Bosler Moon does mster mean something oh one one meaning of the word mster is Cathedral so okay that just meant music means cath meets Cathedral well I get jit very hard there I was sure it's going to be monster the city a well at least the score isn't too bad it was like still 3,700 uh but yeah uh was very much debated can we read that sign my first thought was oh caution snow Bumble Ro okay I wasn't expecting English I was thinking I know there are some some ski resorts in in like Andor and it can be quite mountainous but I guess this isn't Andora or Europe for the matter although maybe there would be English signs but I would expect some other languages as well if it was Europe so will this ever be somewhere in Canada us like British Colombia maybe okay we can't move any further oh gosh the mountains I don't know they feel maybe North American it's hard to tell but let's go I was thinking maybe BC somewhere some sort of a ski resort I think there was like a I think there was a ski resort near Vancouver somewhere I don't remember where but maybe it's that one but yeah just just uh let's just guess somewhere here okay not too bad not too bad it was closer to Alberta or is it Alberta already oh no it is still it is still BC yeah here is that ski resort kicking Horse Mountain that's an interesting name kicking horse don't kick horses please or maybe oh the horse was kicking someone maybe on that mountain possible that is possible this is very different still mountainous but definitely without any snow looks much warmer here where would this be we have some some trail markers son which direction would it be kind of hard to see with the clouds somewhere in the middle definitely very beautiful I was thinking maybe us but there hasn't been anything here I've been moving around a lot but there are no signs nothing just raw nature let's go somewhere New Mexico maybe Arizona New Mexico somewhere in that area and no that was actually Israel okay actually to be honest Israel crossed my men first but then I thought n it would look a bit different cuz I know in Israel you can find some Mountain Trails like that in street view but I doubted myself I thought it would look AIT bit different but okay got one that very very very wrong uh 12,000 well it is still above average so that's good my main goal is to do get the score above average so I'll take that but let's play one more let's play one more let's see challenge link same settings let's go we are in some sort of a more Pokemon Center to Hoku to Hoku ooh to Hoku well this would be Jaan we have Japanese language Pokemon are huge there as well so so would make sense to Hoku some sort of a super like a mall is to Hoku a city doesn't drink a bell mightbe a neighborhood maybe in Tokyo or or somewhere to Hoku let's zoom in maybe we can spot it somehow to Hoku yeah I don't see to Hoku here maybe it is a smaller neighborhood maybe it's in a different city okay let's uh I don't know maybe move around we don't have much time I think I'm just going to stay in Tokyo Sendai andai okay I don't see too anywhere so maybe it was some some Pokemon reference maybe I don't know but okay not too bad got the country right well wasn't too difficult to get the country right but I'll I'll take any wins that I can get another Island yall probably already know I'm not a biggest fans fan of Island guessing this kind of Architecture is maybe giving I'm not the biggest expert in architecture I was thinking yeah maybe I was thinking this architecture maybe gives me Middle Eastern Vibes and we seem to have some Arabic here but where would this be somewhere in UAE what what it uh the plate what's with the plate do we see the plate plate is small and red what okay I have no idea where this is small and red plate with a rabic with water I don't know I'm going to guess UAE but this would this ever be Qatar no oh I I didn't even know there was coverage there Sania silo it is an island within UAE which makes sense it's right off the coast yeah I did not know that that island has coverage that's surprising okay learning something new okay maybe this location might have been overwritten or something I'm not sure that was not the base start Orly ruin Orly and ruin well I guess this would be France Paris Center yeah we are near Paris Orly Orly is is that neighborhood cuz I know there is the Paris orlyy airport I never never thought about what is orley I guess it might be the the area neighborhood so Paris Center is to the north orley was to the north as well right where was orley Orly Airport oh yeah that's there's the airport sign a13 a13 where is the a13 here do we see a13 A6 A10 A6 is here A6 I don't see a13 oh we were there okay it was the opposite oh my God that what is that intersection what the hell are you kidding me no wonder I got the direction wrong what is this mess that's just crazy what is happening here in some YouTube videos I've seen some some Concepts that like these wild intersections can be very efficient but they just look crazy to me but this might be a very efficient uh roundabout even though it looks crazy if you know let me know in the comments uh what is this some Museum of design clothing I don't know looks like might be some some different designer dresses and and and things where would that be Italy and France are very fashionable countries we have some text here let's see a super that looks Italian with that eye letter so where would that be maybe something like Milan that's a very fashionable City I don't think I see any cities mentioned in that text oh what was it why was I reading the Italian version if there's English version right here Roman attack yeah I don't think we'll find the city name I I'll stay in Milan cuz that's I think that's a decent guess let's see if it is it was not is Florence okay well that's also a very nice city what museum was that it was Museo thamo fashion Museum well it definitely look like a fashion Museum oh and we're back to tricky things tricky places some sort of a cave you can enter that looks cool but okay can we get to that sign maybe what's with the plates some Greenery the plates just a number which would suggest an island well this definitely looks like an island as well uh two different languages is one of them French think one is English one looks like it might be French from what I see what island would this be France well France has tons of islands unfortunately in this case from the ones that have coverage H what would this be would this ever be reunion where's the sun I didn't check the sun is right above us it doesn't help oh it was Bermuda Oh I thought it was French oh my bad then Admirals cave that one was how did we do in total 177,000 I'll take that pretty good if you enjoy this play along with the press that like button so I know you enjoy them and I am thinking of doing a video of playing some viewer Maps so if you have any you have made let me know in the comments I can't promise I'll play yours in particular but I'll definitely go through the suggestions and pick a few to play in one of my next videos huge thanks to all my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to

from above and in this one we are going to play international airports map I saw a couple of people requesting an airport map in the comments so let's do it let's do it let's play it if you want to play it along the links will be in the description uh if you don't know how to install the unity script to do this the link uh will be in the info card so let's do challenges turn off three and uh yeah uh let's go good luck good luck okay so looks like we have a pretty big city to our uh West these all should be pretty large well at least mediumsized airports cuz they are international they have international flights so I would expect to be them to be decently sized this one looks pretty big this one is is a big like a railroad coming to it as well uh anything interesting that we might notice on the in the airport itself looks quite modern definitely I would guess Europe from what I've seen thus far from from the city from above from the airport itself pretty big air airplanes it is an international airport so makes sense so the coverage changes if I zoom in even more but I don't think these the these writings give me much do they they're just for the pilots to tax in okay let's see what else we might have here the road Lines no that's that's a railroad the road lines are all white indeed we are definitely driving on the right side no surprises there too bad we can't read that sign directions so what are the okay oh the thought was our houses no those are parking lots for the airport okay A a lot of them let's have a look at that City that we had here we have a river going through I notice a couple of very Red Roofs lots of bridges oh interesting so there's like a like an island in the middle of the city surrounded by river on both sides oh what happened uh now where would that be H I'm not entire L sure I am thinking well what am I thinking something like somewhere like Balkans somewhere there Croatia um I don't know those are my first thoughts but I might be wrong let's let's keep investigating let's see what do we we have here very interesting looking City from above what is this are these residential houses or or is that a cemetery oh it might be a cemetery oh okay very interesting like shape from above so with yeah these Red Roofs let's see so I think the biggest help clue here is this this these two rivers or maybe it's the same river splitting into two uh that might be helpful maybe I'm I'm thinking maybe like Czech Slovakia maybe as well Hungary so let's see looks like a big city with an airport to the east of it we have to keep that in mind and the river keeps going also to the east there okay let's zoom into the Europe uh let's start with like let's not going to be brought this lava itself let's have a look at some of the capitals first since it is an International Airport it would need to be a big city Zagreb the river doesn't fit it wouldn't be Zagreb U it's not Coastal not well we can't really see more to the west but doesn't feel super Coastal Belgrade doesn't align would it ever be Bucharest does not align no Scopia I don't I don't think we saw any big mountains here did we I don't think we do oh maybe some small hills to the east as well so there might might be a little bit hilly so we can't eliminate any any mountains this one doesn't there is an airport to the east there is a river going to the east but doesn't align at all otherwise ever lublana oh there is a big river going to the east is there an airport somewhere here does that does it align not really too bad for a second I thought we had something this ever be Italy somewhere I don't know which cities in Italy have an airport probably Milan has one there is an there is an airport to the east there are no Rivers going through Milan though that's unfortunate ever maybe Germany I could see this maybe being Germany oh I don't know with that many Red Roofs I don't know Germany wouldn't be my first thought I guess po ever H I feel like I've checked most of the big two what kind of big biggest cities in the countries that I'm thinking but it's not going to be Rome no shot no shot that's Rome boy no wouldn't be that South Terin I didn't take Turin doesn't a lie no I'm afraid we we might have a bad start here what else we have wait we have another smaller airport closer to the city another airport less than 2 minutes remaining what is this is must be a very big city it looks like a big city but I'm so lost what is this I didn't check like more Western Europe ever Belgium no the river doesn't align wouldn't be Amsterdam r no not Rotterdam Leon does Leon align wait Leon might align Leon oh my God Leon aligns wait wait wait okay where is it where is it we have this I literally found it with the like 50 seconds remaining I decided to check more Western Europe uh I hadn't checked France I hadn't checked France before cuz France wasn't my wouldn't be my first guess here but well I guess I was wrong it is somewhere like here I was really getting nervous there I did not think I would 5K this good start after all oh no this looks tricky okay this definitely looks like a much smaller airport than the previous one and quality isn't as good as the previous one Shadows are going to the north so we would be still in the northern hemisphere that's good to notice which side are we driving on we're driving on the left side judging by the lines here on the roundabout we are driving on the left side so UK or Ireland right Northern Hemisphere looking like this European looking uh um yeah UK Ireland but how oh okay is this a city up here it's is a city up here it looks like there's a decently sized city well mediumsized City I guess and a Northeast and a much bigger city southeast of the airport well it's not London definitely not there is some sort of a river is there is a river going through here yeah the city with some railway tracks across it so I'm I'm was thinking what what was that City Birmingham does Birmingham align there is a Big Railroad Station railway station there but it doesn't align I don't think Manchester maybe is there a river there is a river with Railroad tracks going over it okay it might be here is there an airport Northwest of it where is the airport here Manchester Airport is to the south of the [Music] city we need an airport to the Northwest does Manchester align after all maybe not yeah I don't think it does after all the river goes a bit differently leads maybe there is an airport here does the river oh there is a okay there is a river that goes through there are ra there are railroad tracks going across it does that align I think the river Direction aligns and the road uh okay let's see does the airport Direction align that's another good way to to to check if it is it or not does the airport directional line it clearly does we have this little Loop T Loop up here yeah that's definitely the same airport leads Bradford Airport this would be okay leads leads leads so we are in the parking lot here somewhere like here is I think nice let's go two perfect scores let's see if we can continue the streak my first out here is Norway looking at these small islands all over the place place my first thought is definitely Norway here there's another city up here that I notice the roofs I could see these roofs being Norwegian roofs but okay let's have a look at the airport itself uh one big Runway is this called taxi way think they use this to get the airport uh the airplanes here and then they lift off so yeah uh anyways like mediumsized kind of on the smaller side airport I would say nothing too crazy can support up to like I don't know 10 or so planes it seems or maybe they can stand here as well then it's a bit more um anyways we're getting a bit off track so where where where is this uh my guess my first guess would be nor let's see the driving side are we driving on the right side I looks like we are it looks like this big truck is driving on the right side so that would check out yes now we have that airport and we have well I know in Nordic countries they're really like to have their airports far away from big cities the Stockholm ARA airport is like 40 kilm away from the Stockholm itself so it's a while it's a while to get to and from Air from the airport um and I think in Norway they also liked to do the same the airports far away could this be B again I don't know well let's see do we see any airports anywhere here bgen LOF Haven I think it aligns this this island yep I think lines spot on this was a quick one here car rental Bergen airport is that the thing I think it is and we are right on there's a doesn't like the road doesn't really go like this as it shown in Google Maps but okay we would be somewhere here yeah okay close enough still a 5k I'll take that and round number four o okay we have doesn't look like a very big city kind of on the medium size I would say there is an airport looks quite small quite a small oh but there are two uh two runways that cross each other okay but definitely much smaller than the previous one so we have okay we have Road lines like this are it looks like we are driving on the right side let's double check that we are driving on the right side yes with these these long dashes on each side of the road my thought is maybe France cuz I know in France you can see that uh can we see can we look at the city itself what do we see here we have some Stadium a couple bunch of football fields here don't think we can see any text sometimes you can see some team names or something but I don't think we can this time anything here not really there's something glitching out a little bit here I don't know why but yeah some some point is a bit off now if this is France which I think it is how would I find this wait what do we have to the nor oh there's wait there's water there's water the coast to the north okay that changes things uh that should make well if it is France it should make it easier to find is ITA Kane we do have an airport here I think it is yeah it is the the the um runways cross each other just like that the coast made it so much easier I was afraid that I'll need to scan for French like all over the French cities for like half an hour well not half an hour but for 7 minutes now okay anyways uh we are somewhere here let's see we would be right right somewhere there nice very good and round number five let's see ooh this is a big city big city enormous City I would even say what the hell is this is this France is this Paris getting kind of Parisian is there an Eiffel Tower sitting somewhere here enjoying the view there is okay yeah this is Paris and we would be is this charl charl deal airport it looks in enormous oh my God what the hell I would be so confused here I had to come here by car oh my Lord if you if you hear about some man getting lost in and Char the G airport well that's probably me airport De Paris oh that's not even char Charles deal that's airport De Paris or Le D where is the g airport CDG CDG here is CDG wait I think we we surely have time to look at CDG can we see it it's kind of North I think we don't see it it's more North I don't think we see it here uh Rip but this one is big as well for sure anyways uh we would be somewhere on the left side here and somewhere here is I think I think nice a perfect game I had a good time let's go for one more let's go for one more I I enjoyed it uh I hope you're enjoying it as well press that like button if you are to to let me know that you enjoy these satell view videos and then to so so why can keep keep them coming so to speak and yeah let's go and if you are playing along let me know what are your results how did you do did you get perfect scores in the first game as well or or not oh this one looks tricky we do have a pretty big looking City to our East the airport okay we do have a couple like three runways here or I think is this a Runway I think it looks like one at least okay well okay not not not that small of an airport it looked smaller at first but it's it's big enough now which side are we driving on it looks like the right side yes definit definitely right side definitely Europe now where that's the big question isn't it definitely Europe we see some Red Roofs I was thinking like Southern Germany maybe something along those lines I don't know that's my first Vibe but uh just just the vibe nothing really strong to go by we have a river small River but well maybe not that small I don't know why why does everything look so small for me here it's not that small when you zoom in there is a river with like an eye okay there's like two islands here with the oh wait what what is this it's not a Dam it's not a dam what is this are these those things that change the level of the river for chips I never remember how those things are called maybe maybe looks like there is like a small waterfall there why am I getting so distracted all the time uh okay so my first thought was ger huh let's see does anything in ger Germany align so we have this big arch in the river so that's something to really pay attention to can we spot that and if we do that's a very good sign okay I don't think it's Germany anymore nothing nothing fits none of the big cities really work okay not Germany um what else what else Slovenia I don't think lublana does not work yeah Lana doesn't work Austria ever Linds no can this to be France again maybe maybe I should check France yeah let's do that let's check France once more well it's not going to be Leon again the the river is different than before so we know that much and it is not Coastal we cannot see any Coast so it's not going to be Mont pelier not going to be Mars toose maybe no doesn't work well okay it's not France I am thinking more East though I am thinking more East I feel like I've checked everything that I thought this could be and it's not but that's a problem we only have two 2 minutes and 50 seconds remaining Poland I haven't checked Poland a lot of football fields here well Germany loves their football but I couldn't find anything that lined up in Germany I have some baseball fields huh where in B when where in Europe they love baseball so much they have like five Fields next to each other what like the really love it here apparently H very sporty City from what I see um those those baseball fields are throwing me off well I I don't know well it's clearly Europe but but I'm not sure though where boss a boss linee can I spot any helpful writings boss isn't helpful the trees look kind of some of them maybe do how do they palm trees or or not maybe not I think they might be like Christmas trees instead from above what is this is MP E toxy I don't know what it means 30 seconds remaining yeah this one is not going to be a 5k I can tell that much I really wonder where this is um I wonder what did I miss cuz I I checked quite a lot of cities butth what did ever be Poland I didn't check Poland well we'll see uh where should I keep my plunk well I hav oh I haven't plunked at all let's keep it somewhere brought this lava I don't know it was checky it was Prague I didn't check Prague well I did not check Prague that is true why did I not check Prague what the I literally checked every other city except I checked uh I checked ostrava I didn't check Prague wow okay fair enough Prague makes sense it was in the area that I was checking I don't know why I overlooked Prague itself and that was a big big airport makes sense for Prague well that was uh purely my mistake there I don't know how I overlooked progue but okay let's move on round number two no no reason to dwell on the mistakes again looks like another big city with a big airport very big airport I would even say this very big hm okay so we got to keep that in mind we're looking for a massive massive airport again this looks like Europe we're getting lots of European uh countries which would make sense cuz in Europe there are a lot of inter ational airports cuz there are a lot of countries makes sense and uh driving on the right side yes yeah the Shadows are going north no surprises now okay let's have a look at that we have a river let's have a look at the city that's here what do we have lots of gray roofs gray roofs Reds bik Lanes would this well if this is not Amsterdam would this ever be rdam or something no UT no yeah maybe not the Netherlands then looks like there is some sort of a palace here should make me think maybe France they have a lot of those I could see this being France maybe but which city it's not Paris and not Paris non how does the river go no it's not non to lose no maybe Germany Germany is a good shot I think with Frank oh it works it does work actually we have this little little turn in the in the river that's it well it had to be a massive um City cuz Frankfurt does have a huge airport and I've been there as well when I was flying to Italy a couple of years ago uh we went FLW through Frankfurt airport so that's a big one that's a big one all right we are somewhere so we have that big thingy we would be somewhere right right here yeah nice very good okay better better second round and first ooh okay this one the the the fields look very mesmerizing very hypnotizing now this one wasn't giving me big Europe Vibes at first the airport okay there are a couple of runways here and uh so so decently sized what you would expect in this map the streets we are going the right side would this be us I am thinking us we have very kind of gridlike streets very much so it's it's crazy how how much of a grid this is so that's that's and we have a baseball field even two of them and baseball is quite popular in America right from what I know and two more baseball fields here I think the question now is which US city would this be cuz in the US there are a lot of cities so without any clues where in the US we might be this could prove to be a tricky task it is an international airport so what would that mean so either well this doesn't look like a super massive City it's not small but it's not not like New York or something so either it is maybe it's close to a border and so there are some flights to like Mexico or something from here or other Latin American countries maybe I that's just just I guess just a thought or maybe close to Canada but this felt kind of More Southern to me for some reason I'm not sure not sure why okay there is a river going so okay we're looking for a city decently sized city with a river going through very W wobbly River and a kind of biggish airport to the West well I was thinking maybe it's like the Mississippi River uh cuz it is kind of wobbly isn't it so let's see where where does Mississippi flow through not going to going to be Memphis okay that's Ohio River this is Mississippi St Louis no it's not wobbly enough not wobbly enough Minneapolis kind of wobbly but uh I think Minneapolis would be bigger than this and the direction doesn't work okay it's not Mississippi I don't think then Ohio River maybe Louisville doesn't work Cincinnati no Indianapolis has a wobble River going through what is it White River would this be Indianapolis I don't think so there is an airport to the West here but no no no doesn't doesn't a line I don't think yeah the airport definitely this this is a much bigger Airport Indianapolis International Airport so we're looking for something smaller what would it be San Antonio is also a mass City it's not going to be that something not too large but still International I've checked a lot of US Cities all over the place but there's just too many cities to check you know so I pled it somewhere like in Oklahoma cuz I think somewhere around there you can get dark red soil maybe if I remember correctly I couldn't find anything that really aligns there so maybe I am wrong um I guess we're about to find out well let's see it was Canada Oh Canada I didn't check Canada I was sure it wasn't Canada for some reason Winnie Peg Winnie Peg well in a hindsight I probably should have checked the biggest cities in Canada but I was just so sure it's us and it's not like I was running out of places to check oh well it was close to the Border I was right on that but yeah anyways around number four okay super dry looking let's have a look at the airport the airport where is the airport wait where is the airport I'm I'm confused usually airports are not that difficult to see okay I'm very confused where where is the International Airport here cuz I don't see any runways do they use the street for that or weird um very weird I wonder yeah what's what's up with this invisible airport I guess we'll have to see afterwards but um okay doesn't look look like we can use an airport this time but let's see what do we have my first thought was kind of Spain maybe I first that was Spain here we have some sort of a castle or something in the middle of a park some football fields Spain yeah I'm thinking Spain maybe I don't know maybe some somewhere southern Italy is an option as well oh this looks like a pretty building so Spain or Italy the city itself how are we going to pinpoint it there is a smaller City to our kind of West is so maybe we can somehow use that there is another smaller city which is connected by a straight road wait is that an airport that's an airport up here an actual airport so we can maybe try to look for this maybe this is an international no one not well it should be another baseball field what's with all the baseball fields today so many baseball fields everywhere all of a sudden no I guess we might as well start scanning cuz I can't seem to find any additional info the rofes yeah I'm between Spain and Italy on this one maybe maybe a bit more even Italy but uh let's see wait is it actually is it actually foggy or no cues it kind of like we have a smaller City to the West connected with a straight road and we have rail roads here to the northeast of the city in the same direction I think it is there is a railroad that goes in that direction and there is a here an airport aeroporto defog Lisa oh that's a oh that's a wait how did I miss it wait what how did I miss it this this big Airfield Runway what how did I miss it it's here well okay well there is just one one one Runway there but but it's clearly visible um guess I was just focusing on this that I yeah did I thought it I I I assumed looking at like at it like this it looked like just a street so I guess that's that's why I missed it um but yeah it's definitely there and can we align it is that the road there we are in between these two roads yes okay okay it was Italy it was Italy after all the architecture felt a bit more ital and then Spanish so I'm glad I was right took me a while to find it though I was looking in both countries now something Coastal okay there is a small island here which maybe could help uh uh with with with finding this now what's with the airport we definitely see a plane here I see an air uh like Airfield Runway long one in the middle of a city huh which direction are the sh Shadows slightly to the north it seems so it would be in the Northern Hemisphere have a stadium with no texts driving on the left side huh okay that's interesting we are driving on the left side I would say UK then has to be or Ireland has to be cuz it's definitely not Japan it's Northern Hemisphere well obviously not Malta and and stuff like that so UK makes the most sense or or Ireland UK or Ireland so with the coastal city coastal city not swans not swans New Haven or something no Coast doesn't really align or either of them I don't know these roofs would look particularly British to me though not really I'm so confused what this is this ever be something like I don't know Thailand or something Indonesia the roofs don't feel UK at all of like but but Malaysia oh I'm zooming it right on it I notice this island yeah it fits perfect perfectly it is Mal malaka it took me a while to realize that yeah the r felt weird but felt oddly I don't know rof felt weird but but I stuck with UK for for a while still even if it felt wrong uh okay so we are looking for the airport where is it here malaka international airport somewhere down here somewhere right here I believe let's go how did I do I did miss two rounds or one yeah two rounds I did not get a perfect score and let me know in the

are playing a very interesting map it's called an unofficial Street world uh and why is it interesting uh it is because usually in these Maps uh people try to include official locations made by Google in this one there are only unofficial locations no official coverage which means that the locations could be anywhere in the world which I think is going to be very interesting so let's see how we do the playalong links will be in the description we will be playing with no moving around cuz some of the locations will will be photospheres so you couldn't anyways and let's set the time limit to minute and a half I think that's a good time limit and let's get going let's see uh I am excited I'll try not to pay attention to the author's name cuz cuz I feel like it maybe gives a bit of an unfair hint maybe I don't know depends how you look at it but what do we have here we have some I think that's might be Arabic I can never tell Arabic and Persian apart like Grand post and it could be one of the countries that has official coverage as well except it it would be unofficial in this case so it could still be Tunisia for example but in Tunisia they wouldn't have yellow license plates though right oh that's the thing you usually learn about all these countries that have official coverage like I know Tunisia has black license plates but I have no idea which countries have yellow ones so I think this this map is really going to be super challenging for me we have Port Theater it looks kind of French um we have Arabic and French but it's not tun eia what else could it be where else would they speak French here would they speak French French in Algeria I imagine they might might speak some French there it was Algeria yes okay so good good good good good Oran it was Oran okay uh very nice I went with a capital here but it was Oran okay now we know Algeria has yellow license plates I did not know that before and I'm very happy with the score there very nice oh all right what is this writing this looks very interesting what would this be H okay well we have uh like a like a gra Gravel Road small Road Sandy Road little bit Healy oh gosh I'm no no cars to look at the license plates at or or see the driving side I imagine that might be be helpful this writing I don't think it's Ethiopia I think in Ethiopia they had some very interesting and unique writing but I guess we can zoom in have a closer look maybe it is maybe it is after all I mean I I definitely can see some resemblance there some of these letters are quite similar so maybe we do go Ethiopia after all cuz cuz I don't know where else would they use a writing like this well if it's not Ethiopia we're going to find out in in a couple of seconds but I think Ethiopia would be my best guess here I think the average of this map was 11,000 points so I that that's my goal to try to beat the 11,000 points I don't think it's the capital okay oh Capital would been would have been a closer guess but it was Ethiopia the writing did help it was the uh the writing let me let me quickly check what is the name of that writing it is the GES script my apologies if I mispronounce pronounce it and it is a script used in Ethiopia and Eritrea apparently okay cool I didn't know erra also could use it very interesting okay let's move on oky do we have Burger and Grill and we have yellow back plates which would make me think we are in the UK the landscape these kind of um greeny is that even a word grassy uh Rolling Hills definitely remind me of British Isles spring flower spring flower that's a lovely name um maybe not as lovely of a boat but the name is cool oh so what where in UK would I think this is would that I'm thinking maybe Scotland maybe Northern Ireland somewhere in this area maybe those would be my main first guesses we have some house a house visible up there white with a dark roof which you can see in that area for sure uh I think that's my best guess I don't think we're going to be able to find anything else so yeah let's go somewhere there ah it was the other coast it and it was England after all it was it not Scotland northlanding there is the Bol house burger and krill indeed so we were right at the North Landing why is it it's not very North is it called North Landing probably some historic Landing happened there I imagine H if you know let me know in the comments I'm always interested to read read your comments and if you play along uh press that like button to support the channel and let me know what are your scores once you finish I hope by the time you watch this you have already finished okay these houses remind me very much of uh maybe nordics or or or what is this could this ever be Greenland maybe kind of creating kind of Greenland Vibes 50 um I don't think it would be Canada or us because of these signs does Greenland uses uh these does Greenland use these signs I'm not sure sure have never I've never paid attention to that in Greenland to be honest so H I am not sure my best guess I think would be Greenland here but uh it could be I don't know I don't think it's Iceland I don't think it's Iceland I feel like we would see some bards at least in Iceland or something I'm getting more of a Greenland Vibe here we are running out of time okay so let's go somewhere in Greenland where is nuke nuke let's go near nuke near the capital ah it was swart okay swabber crossed my mind I don't know uh ah it crossed my mind but I thought it's probably not swall bir for some reason I thought would look a little bit different okay fair enough swal bir you have some official coverage in swo as well I think in this city two okay now I wonder does Greenland use those speed limit signs or no so if they don't then that would have been a really good uh clue let me quickly check okay here I found it in Nuke very similar to the Danish style which makes sense uh but yeah it has this this pipe around and it has this Kil these kilometers at the bottom so okay now now I know well knowing my memory I might forget but hopefully I remember uh but okay that's cool to know cool to know so yeah if you if you knew about these signs then it was of course obvious that it was in Greenland but I didn't know oh that's a cool statue like a guy coming out of an egg with like a cheetah and a big fish at a bottom okay maybe some some some some uh like um myth Urban myth or or some God or something uh let's see where are we I might say the name but it's not readable I don't think soza churas scaria Pia oh gosh what is this I'm getting um I'm getting Latin American Vibes I feel but would this be this wouldn't be Brazil would it very red uh Road I noted this I don't feel I see enough Lang I I can't tell by this if it's Spanish or BR or or Portuguese um I'm thinking Central America Panama no like Nicaragua maybe I I don't know that's just Vibe guessing I didn't see any like OB it was Brazil after all okay I guess it said Brazil on I mean the plates the plates were wide I know in Brazil you do get wide plates and um the soil was red you can get red soil in Brazil but I didn't see any Brazilian polls the language felt maybe a little bit more Spanish but I wasn't sure so that was my reasoning why I didn't go Brazil there but uh how did I do in total 13,632 points well it is above average I'll take that um could have hoped for a bit of a bit of a higher score in my opinion but let's do another game uh and see and see hopefully I can get a better score this time around maybe not well I'll do my best anyways so we have some water like a water tank some generator what else it's too dark I can't cannot read anything I don't even see what is it Latin script or anything else okay now this is a rough round I feel welcome to and we can't read anything well it's in English at least will this be an island of some sorts in Oceania maybe could that be the case a little bit Healy well since this is unofficial coverage we cannot trust the Sun by the way by the way we cannot trust the Sun so that's something to keep in mind I'm turn between Oceania and Caribbean Islands I it's like a coin coin flip it might be in somewhere else of course as well but those would be my two main guesses I'm not sure new calonia can be a little bit Healy I mean there are some heels here it seems so maybe let's go somewhere there maybe Solomon Islands let's see oh it was okay it was Indonesia fair enough interesting that we saw English in such rural Indonesia was that some sort of a tourist camp or something maybe like like a guest house because yeah very unusual for me I think to see English in such a rural place in Indonesia but okay fair enough let's see okay this definitely feels European the question is where post something well makes sense it's a post box the plates looks completely white it is an old car croa Croatia may be with a completely white plate and looking like there are some holy poles there those are some holy poles um I don't see the bottom of the pole I'm not sure would this be Poland or Hungary looking at the architecture and everything maybe I'm leaning a bit more towards Hungary not super sure though I could see this being maybe Poland as well but let's go let's go Hungary here I feel I'll I think I'll just leave it in the middle I don't not know where where this would be okay it was Hungary more south but I I'm very happy with this guess that Holy Paul definitely helped and I'm glad I went with Hungary instead of Poland so I'll I'll take that o this is pretty Innovation home lots of snow snow looks very pretty but I always hate how cold it is when when there is snow it's always cold obviously so um if it was warm and cold oh L land L land safaris okay L land laand was in Finland where exactly near ranii right I think where was the Santas Village I think the Santas Village was oh gosh I might not be able to find it but it was somewhere here I feel snowman world s is this it Santa's husky rides could be somewhere around here laand safaris Lappy shop well yeah this is with yellow signs this language also looks finish to me so I don't know if we are exactly here in Santa Claus office do we see anywhere The Lappy shop or or laand safaris I don't so okay may not be in this uh place but I don't think it should be too far okay never mind it was all the way CA I didn't see it saying CA anywhere and even if it did I wasn't aware that's a city okay it was a bit more North but okay fair enough there are some ski skis uh tracks nearby ski resort still 4500 I'm happy with that getting uh close to that average score this location would be nice if it loaded oh here we go okay well with these okay the license plate is completely blacked out this one isn't we do have the blue strip I was about to say that with these um post boxes it's giving me Nordic Vibes and I believe we have that's a Norwegian flag okay so this would be Norway then uh well should be with a flag so okay well good thing is we know the country not so good thing is that Norway is a pretty stretched out country and I find it really tough to region guess it I often struggle with with figuring out how far north in Norway I guess should be this one doesn't feel super north um so either middle or South would be my guess so maybe let's guess kind of in between kind of middle towards the South hedging the bets if there is anything useful on the bins we cannot read it unfortunately with official coverage the quality will often times will often times will not be up to par it okay it was very south apparently 3,700 points okie dokie last round my first thought was Asia feel super Asian what is the language thef I cannot read it something VF is this Asia elephant Crossing oh it's very Asia we have the Sri Lankan script right I always forget what's the what's the exact name okay well this would be Sri Lanka I guess cuz I know Sri Lanka has elephants right or wait would this be could this be Southern India maybe cuz I know they use the that script down there as well or at least a very similar one let's have a look somewhere or it's just Sri Lanka I think I think I'm more inclined to maybe go Sri Lanka I don't know about these roadside markers but I know in Sri Lanka you can often see black and white stripy signposts and Sri Lanka is Healy so I think Sri Lanka makes more sense but I yeah I wouldn't be surprised not surprised that it is India CU makes a lot of sense as well so I guess you can also see black and white stripy for S Post in India good to know good to know 16,000 points that's better we are definitely getting up there uh all right all right all right let's go for one more one more let's go uh another challenge of course link as always in the description feel free to play along for free you don't need to have a pro account to play play along with these challenges as okay okay DK that's one thing good about unofficial coverage is that often times some things that would be blurred in official coverage are not blurred in unofficial so Denmark this is Denmark well with this uh o letter it would be Norway or Denmark and this is a Danish Danish uh license plate with this blue and yellow so good to know through so where in Denmark H maybe feeling a bit Southern not super sure I don't think it says the city anywhere dball league dball league I don't think that's a city name BW does BW stand for any thing BW maybe an area or a city name BW do they do they use W in Danish alphabet I don't think so so it probably doesn't stand for any anything mightbe just random two two letters I want to go here I thinking it might be more a bit Southern but let's see okay it was kind of Southern just a different Island but okay I'm happy with my G 4600 good start for this uh this seed this game restaurant Duro Duro we have yellow plates with a blue strip once again Pharmacy Pharmacy so we have another yellow plate so this place uses yellow plates so Luxembourg is the first thing that comes to mind being a little bit Healy could be the Netherlands but I feel like um these signs feel more luxemburgish I think that's the word luxemburgish luxur I think it's luxemburgish I think so I would go Luxembourg here restaurant d I don't see anything else that would help me much but the the plates were I feel like are the biggest help I don't know the Luxembourg pedestrian crossing signs that well but this feels like some some small town near a bigger city maybe so let's go W waler dong okay more North it was bufor cool well I'm happy with that luberg is a small City so uh small well both small City and small country um and and uh it's it's good score if you get it right so we have started this game very well another European country we have the blue strips once again now unfortunately I cannot read that sign cuz it's inverse and very well on the we're seeing it from the wrong side h a little well kind of Healy quite Healy actually I am thinking I am thinking something like czechia Slovakia maybe southern Poland something along those lines is my thought but I wait is that a holy pole kind of not super confident but maybe it is maybe it isn't yeah I'm not so not so sure if it is but uh well if it is then it I would go Poland but I'm thinking it is not it might be just a sh shadow that that makes it look like they're just of some sort of a wire I would go Slovakia Northern Slovakia it's quite hilly there that's my guess uh it was Slovenia well Slovenia makes perfect sense as well if you had seen the language it could have made a more educated guess but overall I'm happy with this one as well all right round number four what do we get now well this is not Europe anymore so well the colors the first thing I notice is the colors red white green Mexican colors right so that's what I'm thinking here the pole looks like an octagonal pole so you do get octagonal poles in Mexico so I'm really leaning heavily towards Mexico here right right away no anything else that we notice any electricity counters maybe is that one really hard to see it might be a Mexican electricity counter potentially hard to hard to see though but I'm very happy with going Mexico here well this this is a big clue for me red white and green colors for these football stands or or some sort of sports stands and I would go southern Mexico somewhere Tabasco somewhere maybe even Yucatan or or somewhere here let's um maybe a bit more West okaka is that how you say it maybe let's go somewhere there okay well Ecuador can use the same electricity counters as Mexico but what's with the red white and green stands that one threw me off maybe whoever painted it really likes Mexican flag colors okay I I get very very much deated because I was quite happy with Mexico guess there well okay happens happens now this feels kind of Baltic but something feels wrong so maybe without looking around maybe something like Russia or Ukraine or or something but let's look around what do we have um looking around I'm definitely leaning more towards Russia oh yeah this is a Russian pole with a black black sock or black bottom however you want to call it we have an abundant bike well probably the bike of the person who took this Photosphere uh we have another Russian signpost now it does feel kind of Baltic but at the same time feels off so m I'm trying to think how close to baltics would this be I don't know it's it might be very close it might be very far I'm getting kind of mixed messages here the architecture I don't um I would go maybe further maybe more I don't know maybe more North let's see no maybe not as North I'm so all over the place okay it was near the Kazakhstan border so my my other plon was close sir so okay at least I didn't go at the very border of baltics cuz I feel the architecture felt off for that area so Kazakhstan border makes sense makes sense how did we do in total 16.7 th000 I think this is my best don't remember what what how many hundreds I had in my previous attempt uh but I'm pretty happy with this one the Mexico round really deated me but uh let me know in the comments how you did uh press that like button if we get a lot lot likes I'll do another uh Play Along video on this map on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy and big thanks to all of my patrons and

that sounds exciting to me maybe on the easier side we'll see if I recognize the famous place uh or if I don't and you're also welcome to play along the play along links will be in the description you can play along for free uh you do need to Unity script install if you don't know how to do it the link will be up there in the info card and also in the description to a video where I explain how to do it so let's get going the challenge link yeah will be in description as I said let's set the time limit to 10 minutes as it's usual for the these satellite VI videos and good luck good luck to everyone now what is this this feels like a familiar River shape was this temps I think this was temps um is it I think it is yeah we have the London ey there so this would be the Westminster Abby oh the map is glitching out sometimes it happens with this Unity script let's just refresh uh but okay it shows the location if we refresh that's kind of dumb um but okay hopefully the map doesn't glitch out anymore but I knew that it was a Westminster Abby before seeing it so I I hope that doesn't matter so here is Westminster Abby where is the the intersection is so I think we should be somewhere like here right uh let's close this nice very good perfect guess perfect start is the map working the map seems to be working now good now what is this we have some sort of Stadium well we probably should check out the famous place at first okay we have some church that I do not recognize from Above This no this wouldn't be the Iceland Church no no no no no no way what is this we have some Park here no this looks tricky we have some Coastline onto to the east Northeast and the city seems very big very very big and the middle looks very white and the rest of the city is like private housing I guess is this us this feels like us no like look with these these grid systems wa we're driving on the left side wait a minute is this Australia okay which which direction are the Shadows going that's another clue that we can use Shadows are going almost West slightly to the South so Sun could would be slightly to the north right so would this be Australia or would this be New Zealand with the yellow dashes but I think I've seen yellow dashes in Australia as well on the sides so the coastline was to our East wouldn't be here right the coastline to the east like that I feel like it would fit something like Brisbane know or maybe not I'm confused there are big mountains here I just noticed I don't know how I missed did at first but it looks like these are some big mountains and there is what is this this city looks so cool what is this and really big as well I'm not sure these mountains are confusing me so much big hills and there is another Coast down here this wouldn't be UK right the sun sun is sun was kind of tricky but it does look like it's go the Shadows go to the South so the sun would be to the north what else um South Africa ever South would this ever be South Africa with the coast to Northeast though that doesn't fit well does it the big beach to Northeast not in South Africa that that wouldn't make sense um I feel like it has to be either Australia or New Zealand does brisan not fit the M big mountains with the coast to the South maybe it's just just a small part of Coastline maybe no it's not there what famous place would this be though I don't that church I don't know what the church is this is a really big city h h not able to figure this out is it Sydney no Sydney has a very like Jagged is that the word Coastline so that doesn't fit Christ Church Coastline would align there oh I think it is oh and that's the that's the big mountain okay it is Christ it was New Zealand mhm so those yellow dashes were were uh kiwi good good good that makes perfect sense so we would be is the famous place Christ Church Casino probably not uh Christ Church Cathedral is that it let's have a closer look here we have a street that goes very diagonal diagonally that's the High Street it seems and at the end of High Street we are like right here there is a big circular thing here chalice the sculpture and we are like Northwest of it in front of the Cathedral Square Christ Church of the of the cathedral 5,000 let's go perfect score okay is this Alcatraz I think it is very Infamous Place very fascinating place there's a museum now there right I think would be really interesting to visit it I imagine as a museum not as a prisoner that wouldn't be interesting no no no but uh we would be right I like how the sound thinks that it's water they're like there nice that was an easy one well these are famous places so it should be on the easier side but uh let's see very very red soil and very very big city will this be India somewhere or what is this we have some sort of a a mosque here oh is this this ever be Nigeria which that are we driving on let's have a quick look is it right or left is it right side driving or left side driving it is difficult to tell it might be left maybe oh love to see it a bit clearer before I make any conclusions it looks like it is left side driving so would this be India then it looks left yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay now what is be India then um with this massive massive massive City I'm thinking it might have be New Delhi maybe let's let's zoom in let's have a quick look does that does that fit well in New Delhi we have a river going through wait is this water here or it is water isn't it it is water to the east yeah it's definitely some water to the east I'm so confused we're driving left with water to the East and this m City let's see does India have any cities chenai is this ever chenai is this like thing is is it this H I don't know this is a tricky one does that fit this road or no I don't think it fits I don't think it fits I don't think it is can I what is it then the Shadows maybe Shadows can help the Shadows are going to the north so we would be in the northern hemisphere so uh they don't help too much they don't help too much ever Indonesia driving left super red soil where where in Indonesia would it what are what is the architecture like from the top I don't know I don't know well have the mosque um and Indonesia is a very Muslim country super red soil I don't this location is really confusing me are we sure we're driving on the left side let me just triple check it cuz cuz I mean it look it certainly looks like they are driving on the left side here this wouldn't be Japan this ever like Bangkok or something no way yeah no no it is not I don't know what to think here Sri Lanka no it wouldn't align if we have water to the southeast I would love to see some maybe stadiums with some text on them but super dark soil as well if we weren't driving on the left side I would go with Brazil but well Brazil wouldn't have a mosque though will this ever be daa there is some water here but no this is such a massive City how am I I am very much flabbergasted I've only have one minute remaining I do not think I will be able to figure this one out my best guess is chenai which is kind of similar but I don't think it aligns I don't think it does but that's that's the best I have so I will leave somewhere somewhere here and I'm I really want to know where this was was it India was it something else it tell doesn't align no Uganda oh okay that's the water the coast that threw me off so much the water I wasn't even considering Uganda there because of that water didn't realize that there is a massive Lake here driving on the left side yeah oh my God that's that's rough that was Uganda National mosque that one okay interesting it also explains the red soil yeah that that makes sense cuz that was also confusing me in hindsight it feels so obvious but it did not cross my mind somehow what we have here is that the Statue of Liberty okay this is an easy one after that uh previous one here we go Statue of Liberty oh it's not the statue itself it is here a Viewpoint of the statue nice let's go yeah that that one round the fourth round not good let's do one more with satellite view enabled uh let's go oh okay we saw it for a moment this script seems to have some some issues but uh I didn't see much so what is this is this uh Chichen is that Chichen now will I be able to find Chichen is the question where was it somewhere here okay let's make the map larger a lot of like different view sites here but I do not see chich chaita yet there are so many archaeological sites here but I canot find Chichen I'm sure it was somewhere here there's some Mayan ruins here Chik CH that's not Chichen though it sounds similar Chik CH why is it so hard to find Chichen you would think oh it's such a famous place so surely it would be visible from it marked on the map from from afar nope no it isn't oh chich chenita oh that's a city of chich chenita here I should have been looking for a city called Chichen not a famous place you can see cities from much farther away okay fair enough is there a wait there isn't even a oh here it oh my God you need to zoom in so much to see the the Lark I was looking for a landmark all this time I should have been looking for a city called chich okay so okay well let's see um so we have the city here we have is that an Airfield no way Centro De attenion okay some sort of a center looks like an Airfield uh but okay we are right here I think oh my it took me way longer than it should have but I got there eventually all right what is this now some sort of a square here a park in the middle of a big city now it looks like the Shadows are going to the South which would indicate we are in the southern hemisphere a lot of big windy twisty turns uh roads here is what I noticed which side are we driving on uh we are are driving on the right side it looks like uh my first thought was like Argentina or okay oh this is a huge City with like a mountain in the middle if the Shadows weren't going to the South I would be thinking like you're on or something but Shadows are to the South what would this be Let's see we have some more Parks here big skyscrapers looks like a huge City we have like uh like some sports Fields here but with no text unfortunately no text that could help us oh this is a huge Stadium but also no text okay well Big City Dry looking City lots of look a Sandy spaces areas Sandy mountains Bolivia maybe if we were driving on the right side south southern hemisphere I'm thinking maybe South America um kind of dry looking with mountains Bolivia makes sense to me huge City maybe laaz let's see does that align does that align is is that a road that going through here yes road that goes I don't think it aligns I don't think it does okay maybe not laas coacha Boma maybe maybe notco ever no Cusco is much smaller this wouldn't ever be Li right like we don't see the coast no it's not Le still thinking Laos miic Cordoba ever no it's not as heilly there I'm still thinking La Pause makes the most sense but let's check it again it doesn't work I don't think what else could this be southern hemisphere driving on the right side there aren't too many countries that drive on the right side in the southern hemisphere but the Shadows are clearly going South and the city is huge ever like bot would it be so dry though I think bagot looks different from above I think is this like the rich neighborhood this this this area looks very remote like like separate from others I was sure it would be something like LA or somewhere there but the cities don't seem to align and we only have 4 minutes remaining the famous place isn't helping too much either it's it's just a square in a city this wouldn't no it wouldn't be B of series something in Brazil this dry every Santiago oh is it do we have this mountain how did I not how did I not check Santiago sooner okay Santiago it is Santiago makes a lot of sense when you think about it I don't know why I didn't check Santiago um I think it's here what is it Plaza constit grand square at the presidential Palace oh that's the presidential Palace in front of us this one ah okay cool cool cool very nice eventually got there took took me a while but I got there I got there o this is cool what is this lots of water lots of ship ships going through um okay my first thought was is maybe does that align or it does okay it is the is was this boss forus is it called boss for a straight or doesn't say was this the boss for a straight or or was this no that's d d d straight I don't think I've ever heard of Dell straight this must be the boss for straight then Google doesn't show cuz it thinks that this Cruise Line is more important than the name of this straight cool thank you Google but um yeah anyways this is uh Istanbul and it is is that Haag sopia I think this was the Blue Mosque and this was hug sopia if I'm not mistaken maybe I am let's see um where are they the road is going like this a Sophia kamami I think that is that somewhere here right I think like somewhere maybe more here let's see okay nice 10 m good okay is this the Grand Canyon or something looks very Grand indeed oh wow oh gosh this is looks so 3D it's crazy oh my God oh my gosh this looks so cool oh my gosh it is actually really cool looking in this I think this has to be Grand Canyon right wow I should probably be looking for it but I just can't stop admiring how cool it looks from above how threedimensional it looks oh my God any okay okay okay I got to focus I got to focus um so this is like a Viewpoint of the Grand Canyon right so where was Grand Canyon in nevad Grand Canyon no AR is wait Grand Canyon was it is was in Arizona right Grand Canyon yeah now the question is where exactly this is is we have a road going like that very weakly so to speak Grand Canyon National Park well we have found that somewhere here no oh this might be really tricky to pinpoint Grand Canyon west somewhere here Grand Canyon oh is it here I noticed that this this little road looks very similar to this one do we have a Grand Canyon Village to oh is this the Grand Canyon Village okay I honestly somehow overlooked it okay that's the Grand Canyon Village I wonder how is the life there probably a lot of tourists all the time might get annoying but we are right at the Hy Point let's go another 5K can I get a perfect score I surely hope so at least in one game is this Paris the Triumph Arch certainly looks like that so okay I think this should be a perfect score I believe so and uh let's see let's go okay one perfect score it proved to be more challenging than I thought but let me know in the comments how you did and don't forget to press the like button for more satellite view videos in the future on the right side there will be

one we are going to play a map called world cities a great map that we've played before made by the one and only wolf tricker if you want to play along the links of course will be in the description you can play along for free and uh yeah let's get going just make sure to play the games before watching this video so so you're not spoiled uh so let's do challenge no moving and 1 minute and 30 per round how about that um let me know in the comments if you think it's too little too much I think that's that's what they usually go by but but I'm open to feedback um so wait get to mute everything okay here we go oh this looks very European feels my first thought was Finland but um let's look around can we see any language maybe is that a flag is that a Norwegian flag could we be in Oslo Maybe maybe it looks like a Norwegian flag like blue white and red looks like there might be a cross so I'm currently thinking Oslo I've been to Oslo once I believe in a very long time ago so but I would love to visit Norway is such a beautiful country I I always say that looks very very nice and and modern and clean um is there any point trying to 5K does nor I have tra M does that fit I'm not sure if they do oh manhole cover is maybe they can they sometimes have some useful information not this time uh let's see let's see well we are almost out of time somewhere here maybe and it was Oslo it was Oslo um went with the wrong um street but overall oh are is that oh that's a tra line on the map ah I didn't think they would be there on the map to be honest um cuz I don't think Lan trem lines are on the map but okay uh well then then you can definitely find find it if if you spot that all right all right let's move on let's move on what do we have now Dollarama and yeah as the map title suggests we are in world cities all these locations are handpicked by wolf trer what cute doggo what an adorable doggo um this feels like the US oh no maximum this is maximum so this would be Canada with front plates is what I'm seeing [ __ ] Bank of Montreal well okay monreal is a city but um I imagine Bank of monreal might be in other cities as well maybe with some branches elsewhere I'm not sure but of course Montreal would be my first guess seeing Bank of Montreal and knowing that we are in Canada does monreal have front plates four five I don't think they do I don't think they actually do um so that might be an issue uh yeah yeah yeah yeah am not sure Jagged Little Pill yeah I mean let's go monreal but is Toronto okay makes sense yeah I think Toronto yeah does have front plat since it's in Ontario I think the front plates were in like VC Manitoba Ontario um what's it new bronswick I don't remember about new bronswick and Nova Scotia let's see what now we have yellow lines in the middle once more stop sign no front plates this is very much American fourths Street only pay if we win Quint Quinta definitely us some sort of stadium is this I don't recognize the logos ah it might say the is it i i l i is Illinois right Illinois does does it did Illinois have I think Indiana doesn't have front plates did Illinois have front plat lights or not uh we pay before parking M I think Illinois might be my best guess cuz I think it may be says Illinois on that the one sign but uh this is a tricky one I feel not the best at Region guessing in general let's go Poria okay it was not Illinois it was was it Arkansas is it Memphis Memphis Tennessee okay did it say TN there maybe did it looked like I L to me can we maybe move around wait can we see uh no no we can't move around oh well oh well uh we have uh this this this uh language with the the big big big stripe big horizontal stripe you see that in Bangladesh and India was it a Bengali was this Bengali I always mix the names up it might may be Bengali language so yeah this is definitely Bangladesh with the um driving on the left side good camera quality and yeah what what else can I say I imagine this might be daa looks like a pretty good coverage and uh and and looks like a pretty big big city so let's go daaka let's go daaka there are other big cities of course as well but but I feel like going daaka is the safest bet it was chatam yeah chatram is another big city this time it was chatram well I don't read the script so I couldn't tell I'm sure it maybe said it on the sign somewhere this would be the Netherlands the sign feel signs feel very Dutch we have yellow um back plates also this kind of red paved Road you see a lot of them in the Netherlands oh and of course ton of bikes they do love their bikes in the Netherlands which is great um so yeah this is the Netherlands could be anywhere really most of the Netherlands I feel look like this um like that could be any medium to large sized city so I don't that doesn't feel too much like Amsterdam to me I don't think UT maybe amers Fort mer Fort maybe I don't see any city names uh from where we are uh what's the road Direction I don't think it's going to help much but it's going I mean it could be somewhere here Direction kind of sort of alignance so let's see ah it was just Amsterdam okay I was just overthinking things uh I've been to Amsterdam tce I think um nice city lovely city haven't been there though did not recognize it I was hanging out mostly in like this this area and more south and here I think I stayed where did I stay where did I stay how far uh I stayed somewhere South somewhere here is I think anyways uh doesn't matter how did we do um okay not too bad 20579 points the I did the best in Europe no surprises there not not so good in North America uh maybe I could have made some some better guesses with the Tennessee one maybe but uh not too bad I think I think let's do one more let's do one more another one same same way same settings Good Luck Good Luck Good Luck uh is this a is that no that's not is it no it's not a Colombian cross never mind we are in a where are we dot AR are Argentina are we in ar oh oh this is that's an Argentina it's emergencia I don't see any wait is that an Argentina we are yeah we do have Argentinian plates here with a black kind of looking dot uh the older style plates the new plates will be big and and and modern uh kind of where like like like uh those are taxi plates I don't know if they are the same but yeah the new wear style plates I believe they have like a un Unified style between multiple countries um so yeah you might see those but these are the Argentinian plates if you see this go Argentina well unless the cars travel somewhere else but but generally it will be Argentina um maybe just buies maybe don't see any any good Clues let's just go buus series maybe going outskirts a little bit see okay it was wasn't even that outskirts was just bu series but it's not only Capitals in this map we we've gotten a a couple of capitals but but there definitely are um non Capital Cities as well so you can't just always guess Capital like in Bangladesh for example so uh we are in Kenya with the the big snorkel kinoi kinoi so the question is which city looks kind of dryish doesn't it I don't see any palm trees and then also on the coast line I would expect it to be a bit more green so I'm thinking maybe more Inland maybe Nairobi maybe a bit more North something like Tika uh what else I don't know I think more West the soil would be maybe redder and it would be a bit more heilly I don't know that's just my my thinking maybe it's very wrong but uh let's go somewhere here near Naro in case it is but I think it might be somewhere in this this this region maybe we switch to AI River okay it was does that still I guess it still counts as Nairobi very outskirts okay fair enough fair enough oh what is this is this supposed to be there I don't think it is cuz it's unofficial coverage it might be overwritten well the author's name is Berlin 5 so I think it might be in Berlin come G wait and well we do have some German well yeah I think they don't use gasa in Germany do they uh is Austria anything useful on these plaques maybe uh oh Bank it says Bank Austria as well of course I missed that any any any any city names I love Vienna well I guess we are in Vienna I don't know where that is if we saw some District numbers which you often see in vien that would be helpful but I think with I love a Vienna sign and it's saying Austria in a couple of places well we have to go Vienna and uh yeah kind of well not really tricky but the deceptive with the author's name being Berlin oh let's go somewhere yeah quite quite Central with a souvenir shop looked quite touristy so I thought it probably is somewhere very Central there uh pool and bear okay Apollo Kos AA Estonia huh Apollo I think we might have Apollo Kino in ltia as well somewhere I don't think I've been there Coca-Cola Plaza wait wait have I been here wait I'm not sure wait oh where exactly was it it was in talin it was uh oh God I I I'm not sure if I'll be able to to find it like this is it somewhere here no tolet no I I'm not no no it's not there I won't be able to find it from above I don't think EST Museum let's see where where exactly was it oh there is is Apollo maybe it wasn't that place that I'm thinking of then let's see I remember seeing the Coca-Cola Plaza but where are we where are we yeah it was a different place than I was thinking okay never mind well it was still in talin yeah it it definitely was talin very beautiful city if you haven't been um you should come to baltics in general but but yeah talin is is a great City for sure and you should visit Ria while you're in this this neck of the woods oh uh what do we have we have some cilic and uh this feels very much like Russia to me spider spider huh well well well I don't see any yeah that are you um don't see any city names the phone numbers that I've seen also are not helpful so we might need to go with the vibe guessing here doesn't feel like Moscow or St Petersburg that's for sure which are the steering wheels maybe on the on the on the left on the left I would go like maybe chabin maybe [Music] Kazan ORS I don't know let's see it was n no well was kind of kind of yeah one of these these cities had no idea which one uh how did we do a little bit better than uh in the first game 21.9 th000 pretty good let's do one more let's do one more why not so that uh you can play some more games along I know with the with the new restrictions free users want those challenge links so so let's let's play some more uh new Mark no no Mark maybe um we have uh yeah this would be Austria right why don't we have the um the the the district number is this not Vienna or I would feel I would go Vienna probably here but maybe it isn't this be like gr or something now these don't look like V VI vien vienes is that a word no Vienna Vienna signs I was thinking maybe there's like a city name or or wait is it this is Germany after all huh maybe maybe it is actually now now that it says the a maybe it is it wouldn't be a big surprise to see de in Austria though but uh okay let's go Munich maybe the architecture I don't think it feels very nor to me let's go Munich oh it was leig leig yeah okay well fair enough well those in Hamburg hambur has I feel like very distinctive architecture um I've talked about it in my other videos Amy Amy where is Amy from Davey Village tanning what is this what is this single uh yellow line D on the right side FedEx um me what is it what is it the the poster say can't really read it I'm sure it stands for the city name US Post Office well we would be in the US then the whole style architecture is maybe giving me kind of North like Northeast vibes I can't read I'm I'm I'm sure it says the city name there but uh it's not readable but but but but but pumpkin Pet Pantry this is like a lovely lovely area actually very kind of nice clean Lively with people and then small shops everywhere feels very nice and cozy under the plat I don't know the plat unfortunately do we have front plates is the question we do h I don't know Harrisburg this this would this be a bigger city maybe let's go let's go oh wait it was Canada is is there USPS operating in Canada as well is is that not USPS oh it's Canada Post how did I read it as you United States Post Office what some already as United States post office so I went 100 100% oh this has to be us oh wow I was so WR oh no I don't know how that happened what the hell well it's clearly Canada it's clearly Canada well Vancouver makes sense makes sense as well yeah for sure and very lovely city uh okay this would be Hong Kong Shanghai Street these these um street sign styles are you found in Hong Kong Kong also yellow back plat uh driving on the other side on the left side of the road wait is the steering wheel here or is that a Ste steering wheel anyways uh this would be Hong Kong for sure so let's go there where do we want to go I'm not entirely sure H yeah I don't know where which side of the river I I would go probably still this side of the river maybe bit here is oh not bad at all let's go 49 n very close guess good job good job let's see Norva is it like a some some the movie theater I guess House of Rock Shop House of Rock Shop okay well this would be somewhere in the US of a huh no stopping H don't see much to go by very beautiful cathedral in the distance let's go something like wait did we have front plates yes that plate looks very unique I don't know where it is though Richmond let's go okay I thought that Virginia has greenish plates I'm not 100% sure but I think and well it worked out this time so nice West Bank MS okay what do we have we have uh Cedar Riverside liquor oh it would be somewhere in the US again huh somewhere don't know the plates ta taal Express Tawakal Express I guess MN Minneapolis MN uh Minnesota Minneapolis Cedar Avenue South Minneapolis is that South Minneapolis Cedar Avenue Cedar River said is there like a cedar area here Cedar neighborhood Apple Valley they have a lot of apples there don't see anything Cedar related here in the south of Minneapolis we are running out of time Diamond Lake Uptown it wasn't nearly as South see the Riverside there it was I guess it's a Riverside I should have looked at the Riverside D didn't think of that how did we do in total 18.5 th000 yeah that that Vancouver round uh was a silly silly mistake by me but other than that I thought this was a pretty um decent game let me know in the comments how you did if you played along and don't forget to press that like button to help out the channel on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy and huge thanks to all of my Pat and YouTube members for supporting the channel I hope

and I saw this map an official intersection by one of my community members so I thought I have to give it a try um so apparently there's only Europe and North America in this map so far um so okay got to keep that in mind should be on the easier side so if you want to play along the links will be in the description and yeah let's get going let's get going so let's set it to no moving and minute and 30 how about that so let's go good luck good luck to everyone so what do we have uh first of all yeah that's this is France I was about to say this looks French and then I noticed these um Road numbers these d yellow d Road numbers are French and we should have our French uh license plates as well so do I know any of these places was tours a city name or no tours tours tours tours yeah here it is tours I wonder if that's that tours I hope it is so tours would be towards kind of uh like Southeast Southeast so I wonder how far so what other cities do we have uh Simon fondet and luin my apologies for the pronoun ations uh do I see any of those um here son no son no we didn't have son um okay d48 you usually cannot use the road numbers in France cuz for each subdivision they are different but since it should shouldn't be too far from tours I imagine maybe we can use them maybe let's see if we I see any of oh we're okay we're in out of time um we are running out of time let's just go somewhere here is hopefully it's not too far oh here it is here it was D3 D6 yeah if I had more time I could have found it it was even closer to tours than I guessed okay not bad not bad at all okay we have this red border sticking that seems to be a bug I'll have to report that I think someone on Discord uh was reporting it as well on geog or Discord If you experience any bugs feel free to to uh report them on geoguesser Discord or send a support email um that is all very much appreciated so what do we have we have some bards we have some bards these are either French or oh sorry uh Czech or Slovak bards Czech or Slovak what are those signs in the distance this is this czechia or Slovakia I'm leaning more towards Slovakia maybe um that I think it says SK there yeah okay it should be Slovakia quite Healy quite Healy so where in Slovakia would we guess I know kind of Northern Area is is more Healy so it wouldn't won't be shouldn't be at least here because it's flat there uh let's go hm I wonder I wonder let's go somewhere some where here okay not bad not bad not bad at all imagine yeah if if you play with moving it's certainly easier can move around look at some signs okay this is Norway these are Norwegian SS 801 801 should be quite North generally the higher the numbers the more North you are so what is this roads what are these 81 is there 8 somewhere here 830 8812 let's make the map bigger 810 806 we're getting closer we are getting there 804 773 okay uh 76 where is 801 where is 801 oh no where is 801 oh no no no no no what was the city name maybe that's easier R sandoy 17 oh okay this numu 17 808 17 what are the cities namsos and Brun something namsos and Brun where is that namsos and Brun where do I not see them numos and PR oh okay they were even more south they were even more south okay so yeah there is 801 more south than I thought but but okay still could be much much worse still 4500 points I'll take that DK do DK uh Denmark clearly we have some yellow plates you can definitely see that in Denmark as well sometimes oh and these um license plates blue and yellow side to side like this also in yellow uh also in Denmark if you have yellow all the way to the on this side then it would it would be Portugal you can see those those plates in Portugal although I think recently they changed their plates I don't know if it is already visible in the latest coverage but they removed that yellow thing so guessing Portugal will get turq here so do we see any Odin okay it says Odin there I know where odens is one of my friends lives there Odin so I hope we are in Odin since it says it on the poster um we have 30 seconds R store and rard something I guess we can try to very unlikely that I'll find it but we can try to align at least something and that does not work um I don't know let's just we have 10 seconds remaining so let's just maybe somewhere here let's just let's just plun it in the middle ah here it was story glass v ah yeah there it was again with more time would have 5K it still I'm very happy almost a 5k almost almost what do we have kind of reddish plates now would this be Belgium um looks some looks like some French Le we have a Le to our West where was le le le le le is here le le le okay quite a big H well semi big uh Highway maybe yeah Le okay a lot of Le mentioned so I imagine we would be in Le there is a bridge here P de Congress so we are on the western side of a river um do we see p de Congress or something on the other side is are we here or do we see there is a bridge oh gosh which Bridge we do see a bridge to our South we here the Congress Le yeah yeah perfect um so we are we are we are I believe here above this road here I think I hope let's go I'm happy I got at least one 5K let's see how we do how we did for 24.1k very nice I like this map it's on the easier side but but uh that was to be expected I do like it quite a lot I hope you are as well let's play one more more again the challenge link is in the description played before watching this video of course KET KET katet katet whenever I see cerlic and Latin alphabet on signs I'm thinking Bulgaria and I am thinking this looks like it could be Bulgaria CET that seems like a small place though so unlikely that I'll be able to find it on the map um konet KET a little bit hey does seem right I I'll try to scan it but but but it's quite unlikely quite unlikely yeah there seem to be too many too many small towns as expected so let's just around PL div I was more North how there it was there it was okay a okay generation four now yellow middle lines would this be the US Sur oh no I think this is this this is Mexico I think this is a Mexican sign uh can't really read it unfortunately it would be nice to if we could move closer to it we have sun to the South yeah that checks out um looks quite flat kind of dryish there is some Greenery but but also a lot of dry grass so I am thinking where would be like a bit flat somewhere here is maybe near sad himz maybe somewhere there I don't know maybe it's too dry there maybe it's a bit more South La Carolina somewhere there maybe let's see ah was West was more West was okay yeah I mean it is flat there checks out checks out ah yeah I mean I got the country right with Mexico is pretty big so the score is punishing punishing we have a Polish Boward here polish Boward quite Healy I'm thinking Southern Poland maybe yeah definitely Poland with the the letter this L letter is pronounced V like a w in English basically um so yeah fun fact these are also polish signs vitami wait vitami wait was vitami a city vitami vitami or am I tripping I've heard of I feel like I've heard of vitami but maybe in a different context vami oh no is that a city or am I tripping I guess we'll find out soon enough in the meantime I'll try to find it somewhere if I've heard about it it shouldn't be too small I do not see it anything else Ria yeah not finding it um if you if you do speak Polish okay first of all let's check is is it a place no it isn't let me know what what does vami oh was it just welcome vami maybe it's just welcome maybe it's a welcome to the city or something very very uh border uh border location what do we see here uh some yellow sign in the distance huh a big blur big big blur there oh what is this we have 37 H and we have some cilic and Latin on the sign now what this be Bulgaria or H I'm thinking maybe maybe Bulgaria again I feel maybe I think I think yeah that's what I'm thinking 37 I think in Bulgaria the RO numbers were pretty nicely oh 37 oh hello uh what does it say grud something grud I'm sort of a SE grud is like um grud was grud like a is it like a city or Palace or something it meant grad let me know let me know if you speak uh Bulgarian or or I think probably same in Russian grad was it a city was it a palace or something um I my my knowledge isn't that good well 37 is here I so do we see any grud grud I don't see any grud though whoops don't see any grud but I'll take it good guys oh okay Norway again uh e45 okay e45 feels quite Northern doesn't it ah it's a bit too far let's see is it 90 e45 do we have e45 E6 e45 is here is there E90 uh is it like Road 90 somewhere here e45 what's the road Direction e45 goes like this and then turns and then turns and it's on an intersection got to keep 92 could it be here is it 92 oh it could be it could be 92 actually oh I actually like this guess let's see let's go let's go how did we do not as good as the first uh first challenge but yeah still pretty happy with the result if you did play along let me know how you did and on the right side there will be some more play along videos that you should try out big thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a one wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path":

"hello and welcome back to another exciting satellite view video in Geer uh and yeah today we're going to play what other better map to play the satellite video on the world cities I feel like this is a great map for for satellite view game mode and yeah let's see how we do um the play along link will be in the description so feel free to play along let me know how you do if you do play along and here we go here we go um there is a new updated script why is there snow I think I had the live weather turned off why is the weather off uh why is there snow 3D oh no uh Road satellite why is there snow weather is off okay I guess we we will have snow on this one which side are we driving on let's start with that as as we usually do um the qu quality is not the best but it looks like we're driving on the right side why is there snow it really distracts me hopefully there's no snow in other locations that we get but yeah we're driving on the right side pretty big roads four lanes in each each Direction um it is four right one two three four or five even five Lanes in each Direction so a big city with a river going through so that's good should help us uh hopefully we have mountains a big mountain here going through the city as well H kind of grayish roofs some green roofs as well green and blue and gray they're green roofs I don't feels maybe Asian would that be Asian green roofs um we have some sort of pool here or something playground I guess do can we SP thought like any language anything like that any any stadiums with some writings maybe there is a baseball field um I know wait is that Korean I thought I saw Korean on the road uh one of my guesses was Korea or is it is it maybe Taiwan maybe what I want oh there is a big mascot here of a cat um would Taiwan have a river like going through like this well let's let's check is there a river somewhere oh there is a river yeah uh so there are some rivers in Taiwan as well so maybe Taiwan Taiwan or Korea would be my main two guesses here so there is a river seems like it flows into the uh some sort of a sea maybe to our Northwest I think maybe just getting that kind of vibe I don't think it'll it fits Tye does it no no it doesn't okay not typ pay what else uh no here would that work we have some some islands here some small islands does that work does that work no oh does it no no it doesn't no it doesn't no it doesn't um okay I don't think Taiwan works I don't think it works okay let's have a look at Korea now wait I should probably close that window Korea Korea Soul um Soul aligns perfectly yes this is soul okay it was so it was Korean I thought initially it looked Korean but the quality was so low I starting started to doubt myself it is definitely Kore definitely Soul it aligns perfectly these Parks this smaller River it is definitely there let's now align it let's now align it it makes sense cuz uh baseball baseball is big in many Asian countries in particular Japan but Japan drives on the other side of the road so soul and Taiwan were my main candidates here so yeah let's see let's see so we have this kind of a big park or something um do we see that on the map um okay so we have stadium is that University wait I'm I'm confused and we have this road that turns slightly a pretty big road that turns slightly uh where is that stadium is that the stadium Soul World Cup stadium that we see here and the road that turns Soul World Cup stadium I'm so lost where are we so we have this Wiggly Road I think that's that this road here this Wiggly road we would be somewhere here is this the road that turns is this the turny road oh and this is the the park the war and women Human Rights Museum is right there and that's the yeah the the seon sun neighborhood park okay so I think we are on this road SE SE Miss I think that aligns pretty well uh oh gosh how are we pinpointing this this is going to be tough there is another road okay that's the other Road I think going there this one here then there are some smaller roads oh gosh that's the one that that's to I think we're actually right there where I've pinpointed plon I think that's that's the smaller like there's two small roads going both sides of this this building I think we're right there I think oh let's go let's go okay good start 5K always nice to start these videos with a 5k oh and we get a coastal location I like Coastal locations as you know cuzz usually um usually easier to find cuz easier to align uh with with the coast all right so lots of orange roofs my first would be Europe but you can't see orange roofs elsewhere as well let's see so the Shadows where are the Shadows going let's see let's see the Shadows are slightly North it seems but slightly driving side we are driving on the right side it looks like looks like we are driving on the right side here so Spain or something what would this be anything interesting that we notice in the city or or not some some clouds some pools maybe now Portugal wouldn't have Coast to the east my main guess at this point would be Spain that's wait is that a river that is okay that is a river that flows into the sea okay so and are those those are not mountains those are just beaches it looks like there is a stadium it looks like it's mostly just houses so maybe a touristy City with lots of different accommodations so let's let's align it let's see if it actually is there if it is Spain or is it something I should look for something else is it Valencia I don't think that Alli this could be Italy I guess as well if nothing in Spain allign well which I don't think it does actually I don't think Valencia works now the the angle is different there isn't a river yeah I don't think Spain works valenci is the only only city that kind of aligns but that's not it okay I guess oh what is this could this could this ever be France wait is it no no no no no no no no no no okay let's see let's look at Italy we have a river but it doesn't align oh God okay this might be harder to pinpoint on the line than I was hoping for Remini ever oh the angle is wrong for Remini that is wrong maybe it's a bit like a smaller city than I thought I've been looking at the biggest ones but maybe it's something smaller something here syuz no it wouldn't be here right no they're no oh my what is this okay let's Zoom back in what can we spot that would help us anything at all a lot of pools outdoor pools there are some big supermarkets here as well H big Stadium but no text no text on it wait the Shadows are going to the South what wait is this like Brazil then wait why did I think Shadows are going to the north they're going to the South that's a plot twist that's a plot twist oh God we don't have much time though that that's not good oh my oh my oh my would this be anything else what else I think Brazil makes a lot of sense um anything else Argentina oh gosh okay let's see let's see let's see let's see um what do I no it's it's definitely not that River no no it's not there oh Rio doesn't align that's for sure Victoria wrong angle that's too small no no wrong angle again um no I don't it looks so European though but but hard to tell from above I guess reif no no this city doesn't align now not tall oh now this aligns yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes oh here we go we have this this roundabout here okay nice I'm I'm very happy that I found this barely with less than 2 minutes to go we have we are right here um um how do I like pinpoint this exactly we have this here we are like basically out near this store somewhere there's this house we are like here I guess okay nice 8 m oh good second round good second round let's see okay the quality right off the bat is not great at least from this zoom level it is definitely not Coastal oh no this is bad the quality is very not good Nas n does it say n is it like abbreviation for the football team oh my that's a lot of cars are those cars the quality is so bad oh my um um okay let's see what's happening here maybe it's a little bit clearer around here okay we are okay where are we okay the Sun the Shadows where are they going um I think they are going to the north yeah they they seem to be going to the north yeah yeah yeah definitely okay uh my okay which side are we driving on I was thinking maybe India but uh but but but yeah figuring out which side which is the driving side is quite important here I it look like we're driving in the right side so it's not India it is not India um Nigeria maybe maybe or Brazil maybe um okay very green very green Nas it said on that football whatever Stadium or anything else Nas I don't think I've heard of the city with the name NS in any country there's niche in uh was it Serbia but this is not Serbia I can tell that much um okay let's see maybe we can find some other texts or or Clues the houses can't really tell from above whether they feel more American or African to me uh could could be either way the I don't know I don't know and there are no Rivers no coasts to align unfortunately which would help a lot wait is that a river that is a river okay we do have a river that is going south of the city it seems okay and it does it does seem like a very big city so that's good we have an airport here of like northern part of the city let's have a quick look at Nigeria ever Abuja ever Abuja kind of more inclined to go with Brazil to be honest more more North is more dry I think but maybe that's why it looks like this I don't know there seem to be a lot of lot of greenery here I don't think it would like would like would look that green up here feel like it's drier up there okay let's have a look at Brazil manous the the Amazon River would be much more prominent in manow and there are a lot of roads going everywhere the the infrastructure isn't as everywhere I here I feel so maybe something more like teresina or something gosh I really don't know I'm just trying to figure anything out at this point kind a dark red soil and some places dark red soil yeah this does not look promising like I don't find anything that would fit in Brazil ever GH see there is an airport but the direction doesn't align tamale tamale don't see an airport up here um 2 and a half minutes cono I did check cono right it did not work no there is an airport there but um it doesn't no no it doesn't the line um gosh I wonder if it's a country that I haven't even considered maybe what could it Bean airport does not align either no my main two thoughts were Nigeria and Brazil but but but if I would be probably more inclin to go Brazil but I wonder where I wonder where it's a Big Country I kind of looked at the biggest cities but maybe maybe it's not as big as it seems maybe it's something a bit smaller or or maybe I've overlooked something that's always possible as well yeah I think I'm just going to leave it somewhere where my plonk is and just just hope let's see it was Nigeria after all gosh darn it well at least I can considered it where was it enugu where is the river that's that's the river oh gosh well I guess it's there yeah but oh wow oh there y there is the airport yeah that aligns well I didn't even zoom in on a noteb cuz I didn't see like any River there but I guess if you zoom in close enough there is a resemblance there m yeah well kind of Bitter Sweet I did not guess it correctly but at least at least I considered um the country so that's nice at least something we have uh some river system going to our North here um we have what was that oh gosh this is going to be a tricky one again are those all cars first of all the quality is terrible again again will this be Nigeria again probably not looks different some sort of a like a stadium um gosh gosh gosh which set are we driving on can we tell with this not so great quality can't really tell seems like lots of agricultural Fields is this a city down here it is it is the Shadows are going to the North in some ways similar to what we had in the previous round but so maybe would it be Nigeria again I don't know I don't know I don't know or would it be Brazil this time or would it be something completely different this time the river should be more noticeable and it looks like the city is very spread out like there aren't there isn't like one small City with lots of high buildings but there is lots of like one or two story buildings like everywhere basically I don't know what to think of it lots of trees here around these houses lots of agricultural Fields um where would you see that brownish soil and orangey dark H I'm thinking Brazil currently that's that's my thinking just everything that I mentioned together doesn't feel entirely entirely European to me just the houses the they I don't know just just doesn't feel entirely European so I don't think it's Europe um anything else it could be driving on the road right side um sun to the north I don't know some parts look very European some parts don't look European that European to me starting to think maybe it is Europe after all I'm starting think more and more that this is Europe after all but where where where in Europe would this be somewhere quite flat it seems if there like Hungary Romania no Ukraine I have no idea where in Europe this would be this wouldn't be lvia would it that would be funny if it was I don't think so no and Poland the river would I don't know the direction kind of Alli in some places but I'm not convinced Germany don't think so per no it's not turkey I'm thinking maybe like Bulgaria Romania Poland ever Lithuania Ukraine I'm I'm feeling super lost on this one Russia ever Russia I kind of want to go Poland if it isn't Poland hopefully it isn't too far from the actual country cuz I I I I'm not going to pinpoint this one I'm not going to pinpoint this one oh gosh I hope it's at least better than my previous guess between Brazil and Nigeria let's see wait which side were we weren't driving on the right side though no are you kidding me I was sure we're driving on the right side what well now it looks y driving on the left side why why did I think it was the right side that one through me completely off trails I wasn't even considering this like all the other agricultural Fields the houses some houses felt wrong but this is bad this is bad I I I started this challenge so so well and it's just all going downhill um so okay we have one more round remaining it's Coastal that's good hopefully I can find this okay so direction of the sun North uh Shadows are going north um we kind kind of both red and white roofs okay we have an airport here uh near the city the city itself doesn't look huge doesn't look super big okay we have a smaller City down here with kind of more private houses it seems private houses let's see the road we are driving on the right side okay not going to be Bangladesh again this is definitely right side and and and and and the house is I was thinking maybe American American kind of these grid grid like streets although there are quite a few Wiggly streets as well which would be more European I would say feels more European to me than American so we had that Coast too we have land down here again oh my what is this what is this the center line is that yellow is it actually yellow or am I tripping it looks yellow so maybe it is American after all no we definitely have some yellow things in the middle definitely some yellow things yeah that's that's yellow that's yellow okay so we are in the US or Canada then that that helps that helps um okay um this feels warm I don't think it would be too too far north um oh we have a baseball field that that helps baseball is certainly more popular in the US than than in Europe as well so another kind of kind of reason to lean us or Canada so this could be an like an ocean could it ever be one of the Great Lakes I was thinking more of an ocean but it's a small town it's a small City it's not going to be like New York or or like Philadelphia or anything it's it's going to be gosh how am I going to find this if it actually is on the East Coast how am I finding this there's like a bay maybe that that would be easier to find maybe gosh oh gosh oh gosh how far south am I thinking like hard to say I don't think we see do we see any palm trees I don't think we do do we or are these any of these palm trees maybe are they it's hard to see maybe some are palm trees are there a lot of beaches here or no we have some sort of a structure here we are running out of time as well oh there is there are some islands here off the coast maybe that could be helpful somehow maybe I can glance over see maybe something anything that remotely fits I like that the city is called Newport News oh that always that name always amuses me maybe those are not palm trees maybe it actually is this far north or maybe we should check the Great Lakes maybe we should oh it's not going to be that North no chance I mean these islands kind of fall line but it's not here oh gosh you're running out of time that is not good and looking at the Great Lakes I don't think it would be in The Lakes though I feel like it looks way deeper than a Lake Wood from from above that's that's my thinking it wouldn't ever be here right I feel like I'm overlooking something I didn't I didn't think I looked down here would this ever be Texas this is a tricky one to align I feel like it has to be us or Canada but I've scanned the whole east coast and to no success unfortunately Ely I this we'll find out soon enough how far north it is okay we're out of time I'm I want to go a bit more south somewhere here maybe it was Mexico oh gosh okay I did not scan Mexico didn't feel that far south to me it was chetumal chetumal oh here are yeah here are the islands but again like it would be so tough to find even if I scanned Mex the coast of Mexico as well I don't know I don't think I would have found it I I didn't see this part right I don't think I saw this this part I only saw like like like it ended like here oh anyways pretty not good I was hoping for better results but um the first two rounds were good so so let's focus on that but if you played along let me know what were your results uh what what what mistakes did you make uh but yeah I hope you enjoyed this s riew video if you did press that like button and on the right side there will be another one that I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and

hope all of your aspirations and wishes come true this year as for me this year you can expect one to two videos per week hopefully that's the plan at least so hopefully I can stick to it and yeah today we are going to play some more play along games in a map called a distinct world which uh is good for uh supposedly no moving and nmp Z games we're going to play with no moving and hopefully we can make some insane guesses uh as as it says in the description it's good for practicing different distinct regions in the world so which could be really good for improving my and maybe your uh skill levels as well quickly before we start big thanks to Lauren who is one of my patrons thank you very very much for your support all right let's get going as I mentioned we are going to play with no moving let's set it to 1 minute 30 per round that should be enough as always the links will be in the description play it before watching this video so I don't spoil anything so here we go ooh what is this my first thought is like Northern Russia maybe maybe let's let's look around um there isn't too much to see do we see the the plate is wide with no blue strip like just just the name Fe the vibe these uh concrete block roads I was thinking somewhere here is near morans or something that was my vibe yeah I I think let's go somewhere there it's it's not like I'm going to find any more clues here cuz there really isn't much okay not too bad not too bad um it was Northern musan not exactly where I guessed but I I'm kind of happy still um my thinking was right let's go let's go good good start I would say not not not like the greatest points but still good enough we have some Ballers which I can't really see maybe we have some closer ones um wait these ballards with a black top like that why do they have a black top if they didn't have a black top then they would be Turkish why do they have a block top I'm confused these ones still do have a black top here wait okay I'm confused what is this look Let's ignore the ballards for a second what do we have I mean Russia can have some weird ballards so would this be Russia like again um the sun is to the South yeah I in Russia is a big country big country but the houses maybe feel feel more European to me okay this this this location is kind of confusing me with these bards to be honest um and we are running out of time very quickly I will go kind of I don't know somewhere here is it's a very risky guess it's not Russia it was not Russ it was Hungary okay good to know I hadn't seen those Bowers before cuz yeah the houses felt kind of more European rather than Russian but I didn't really know what to do with those bards those were weird ones but okay learning something new every day that is good there's always something new to learn in geogas which is why it's such a cool and fun game in my opinion uh we have a pisan Crossing sand with five uh five lines in Nordic countries five lines you get in uh Finland uh and the language is also definitely not Swedish as well so yeah this is definitely Finland but but but where WEA WEA Hal WEA is WIA a city name WEA WEA Hol I imagine means Hall weal I imagine it might be a small town if it even is a town might be just just like a sports hall or something um let's go somewhere there okay WIA was not a city yeah okay fair enough weal okay yeah if you're if you're know finish let me know what is imali what does that mean all right uh this is um this is uh my first thought was Western Europe not the Netherlands because of the white plate maybe Belgium let's let's look around let's see this these brick buildings can't really see the language there definitely very European feeling but uh could this be Germany could this be like Northern Germany Construction Group you can't really see the language but in German I know there are a lot of words ending with erer so oh what is this teish Tavo teish might be a carpet in German teish I mean this feels like Northern Germany with these um white plates kind of German looking language um brick buildings like these I would go will this be ever Han uh Hamburg Hanover Breman let's go let's go Hamburg let's go Hamburg nice let's go good guess yeah in Germany those brick buildings usually usually you see you will see buildings like we just saw more in Northern Germany so that's a good way to kind of region gu Germany sometimes oh gosh okay uh we have this uh distinct uh Google car or more like Google quad bike or something in this case but okay we have birch trees quite a lot of birch trees which which would make me think North but I do not recognize this um Google car so I'm thinking looks like there has been like uh like a forest fire somewhere here with all these dark burnt up trees I I I know there has there is some like the Smokey coverage in Russia because of like fires and stuff could this ever be I don't remember where exactly it was it was somewhere like here could that ever be that one um I think that's my best guess I can't remember exactly where it was but it was somewhere in this region well let's see if it is that one or not really uh oh it was not that it was just Canada okay well Canada was would have been my second guess but I hadn't seen that car before I had no idea where it was uh makes sense some National Park Cen sometimes you do get some weird cars in National Parks wood B Buffalo National Park in Canada of Canada um okay that's that's a new one to me I hadn't seen that coverage before north of Alberta okay so hopefully if I ever see that coverage again hopefully I remember Wood Buffalo national park there is looks like one big National Park in in Alberta in the north of Alberta so it's somewhere there the road oh gosh the road is barely VIs visible on the map wow okay fair enough uh that was a trick some tricky locations but I'm pretty happy with my uh score to be honest definitely beatable but uh I'm I'm happy overall let's do one more let's do one more game again Link in the description and if you do play along let me know in the comments how you do do you manage to beat my scores or no did you learn something new let me know I'm always interested to hear your thoughts and opinions um what do we have here we have some uh dashed lines but these ones are longer than you would see in Sweden and also just the nature feels more Norwegian so I'd say I would say Norway now how far north in Norway is the big question also the house feels quite Nordic yeah I sometimes do struggle with with figuring out how far north in Norway we are the trees seem quite small small and frail some of them at least there are some bigger ones as well though so uh I wouldn't go super North maybe somewhere Central is maybe somewhere near Trondheim somewhere there oh no it was super North okay never mind sometimes when I think it's super North it turns out to be here and vice versa so yeah that's probably something you should practice more cuz you do see those those small frail trees in North a lot um we have a a gray car which should make me think bhan off the bat let's let's look around what else do we see we do see red license play which you also see in Bhutan the architecture also feels quite Asian so another um reason to go Bon here so yeah uh speaking about regions which what region is there any are there any distinct features about a region well if there are I don't know about them I know Southern Bhutan can be look very flat but this doesn't look flat so it's not going to be there um but uh maybe just near near team let's go somewhere there yeah okay pretty much there nice good guess all right we have um yellow out oh wait is this the oh is this the big mountain oh wait okay uh we have yellow outer lines which you see in a bunch of countries but in this case I believe this is going to be utini these mountains to the east uh I believe if I remember correctly you can see like is it here yeah you see this road going here and here are those mountains all the way to the east like which is the border between in South Africa I believe it's going to be there what's the road Direction exactly slightly at an angle so somewhere here is maybe could be could be somewhere one of these sections yeah uh any any intersections anything not really just a straight Road in all directions uh let's go somewhere there I I'm pretty sure it should have be there nice okay I'm very happy with this guess I had seen those mountains before which is why um I remember them they they look very distinct so fits fits with the map title now these are polish bards now appear so okay polish bards with such a big lake is that a lake or is it a sea looks like a lake or maybe a gulf what is this to the South South to the South um okay could be maybe this Lake I mean Poland has a lot of lakes Po and has a lot of lakes oh could it maybe be somewhere here huh would that be possible chin Lagoon could this be Shin Lagoon maybe that I imagine that would be quite a distinct area there is a railroad here so so if we had more time maybe we could try to find there is a railroad here but it doesn't really align well [Music] with every somewhere up here no no no the angle wouldn't align somewhere here there is a railroad ooh this is such a great area oh gosh oh this oh I think this is a pretty epic place yes it was here o wow okay this yeah this if we had more time yeah would this this makes more sense because this is is closer to the water nice oh this is interesting I'm not sure if I've ever seen coverage there before but it just made sense very distinct indeed fitting the map uh very well oh okay um is this the camera glitch is what that's distinct here we have par which you see in South America we have some some some signs we have a yellow plate we have yellow plates we have a little small stubby antenna which would indicate Colombia with the yellow plates um so somewhere in Colombia I'm not sure where in Colombia you get this camera glitch I can tell you that much I don't know about that is that City specific or um just area specific if you do know let let us know in the comments that would be appreciated narv narz well I I'm not sure if that's a city name narz probably not but um I'm pretty happy with Colombia here let's go somewhere I don't know one of these cities let's see more south to queres seems like a pretty small City so that camera glitch might be uh specific to that City in particular maybe how did we do pretty good 21.3 th000 I'm very happy with this score much better than the first game as well but yeah if you did play along uh first of all press that like button and let me know in the comments how did you do and again Happy New Year to everyone big thanks to all of my patrons and YouTu members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest for day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path":

welcome back to another geoguesser video and in this one I thought we could do some Google car practice I feel like I might be getting some of the Google cars and of course new ones are being added regularly with new coverages and stuff so I thought um let's play this map um it's it's a popular map currently with 205 locations so I thought Let's uh let's see let's see if I recognize the Google cars maybe I learn something new maybe you'll learn something new as well so let's see let's see um let's set the time limit to like 1 minute per round uh and yeah the playong links will be in the description and with no moving yes okay weekly before we start this video is brought to you by Lauren who is one of my patreon members thank you very much for your support let's go what do we see okay this car is Dominican Republic with the white front these bars with black um uh Stripes black bars um I never know how to tell the two cities apart there is coverage in Santo Domingo and Santiago de los caberos uh but but but but but let's go let's go Santo Domingo cuz why not all right what is this car just a regular white car with this white back I mean you can get the white uh Google car back in a bunch of countries with this landscape without too many trees around um those are just some bushes that we see here uh I would say this would be lutu you can see a white car like this in like South Africa ludu eswatini uh and these these houses are giving me I feel like you see them in uh ludu but I'm sure you can see them in other South African countries as well but I would go luru here yes now okay UAE maybe what's the car um okay we have a big blur big blur I know um Qatar had a similar car with a thingy like this but I think more of the car was V visible I think this kind of a wide blur not 100% sure I'm thinking H Maybe is just Qatar cuz I know Qatar had like such a thingy on a different car though but maybe this one as well okay let's go Qatar because of this this this antenna with the the circle with a ball on top I was thinking it kind of feels like it would be up here near all core cuz up here you don't get many trees or anything okay it was it was okay it wasn't up as nor North it was kind of North in between Doha and alore I think some new coverage was added recently right to Qatar um so yeah good to know good to know um this is not an official coverage so right away um there's like if you're interested in official like learning Google cars there's no point at learning on official ones I can tell you that straight away um but but but what is this like we're driving on the left side yellow back plat um is this Uganda um not sure Uganda or cania one of the two any Flags anything else nearby that would help us uh I can't really read it something politic pollution political something I'm not sure um I'm thinking maybe Cala or maybe is is just H I don't know is kalala as Healy though uh good question okay it was kalala yeah okay um nice but yeah it was unofficial so we have this white back of the Google car again once more what do we have this time e the signs would indicate we're drawing on the left side yeah so I'm thinking this would be just lutu once more again not many trees bare mountains driving on the left side let's go luru let's go luru here yes it is I'm okay I did pretty well this game recognized all of the cars well yeah but uh let's do one more let's do a few more games just just to practice our Google cars maybe we learn some new ones oh we're down focusing on the GH tape straight away as as you most of you if not all already know this is one of the first metas people learn when playing geoguesser that uh in Ghana you will get this tape on the Google car uh keep in mind that in reunion the island of reunion down here you will get tape on the back uh bar so that's something good to know but uh if it's on the front bar like here in this case it will be gunana and most you don't get reunion very often um so yeah all right what is this now huh okay I'll be honest I don't know this car looks like Generation 4 with this front of the car I believe okay let's see what else do we have I was thinking like um Mexico maybe at first we have or Argentina I'm not sure the sun is to the north so probably not Mexico then um could this be Argentina you know in Argentina you can see these kind of fences like like this sometimes um like yeah like shap shape like this I've seen them in Argentina before but I'm sure they are in other countries too I don't really see any the plate okay this plate some of these plates do appear Argentinian with this kind of dark dot in the middle so yeah I'm pretty sure this should be Argentina uh I would go somewhere Coastal is okay it wasn't Coastal is but it was Argentina so I'm not sure if that car indicates any particular region or or Argentina in general but if you know more details let us know in the comments I would gladly learn some more straight away we see um the plates with the red um stripe on the left side which would indicate kirgistan and also we can see the Shadow and in the shadow you can already see the Google car if we look down here here it is uh we can look in the mirror if the if this tire touches the bottom side of the mirror it would indicate that um you are more kind of in the western Southwestern side of kyrgistan but since it doesn't touch um the bottom corner um you're not in that part so you could be basically everywhere else where there is official coverage so maybe near Bishkek I don't know let's just go somewhere near there yeah it was just near Bishkek in Bishkek okay what is this is this like Sagal I'm thinking uh big blur very massive blur uh lots of new coverage like this uh recently uh but I think we have a blue plate there which you can see in Sagal these types of poles are also quite common in Sagal yeah I think this should should be um just senal yeah let's let's go let's go there I not sure where and also yeah that these um Dash lines um are common in Sagal as well um so yeah good to know good to know very Northern here okay uh these Road lines right away you don't get in many countries um this this yellow solid line with white stripes I believe it five countries where you can get them which are um Argentina Uruguay um Finland the Philippines and New Zealand um looking like this in particular um this looks very much either Argentina or Uruguay based on the landscape the road like The Vibes in general let's have a look around we got to pay attention to the Google car itself right uh I'm not sure about this particular blur but the white wooden poles these ballards um those would all be signs of Uruguay and in general yeah like the the just look looks like it looks like Uruguay uh does so okay pretty good um which one I didn't recognize oh well the Argentino was is where I lost the points but all the countries got them right which is nice uh let's do one more let's do one more I think we we're doing pretty well overall pretty quick as well now this car is of course the Ugandan car with these side mirrors visible like this very interesting and unique blur and in Uganda most of the coverage is near uh kalala right yes yes yes it is right there ooh is this new is this Greenland without looking around I'm thinking this this car was in Greenland and the houses certainly look like they could be in Greenland so and I believe you got this car only in nuke in Greenland in the capital oh let's let's guess there yes perfect almost the 5K even oh we had this one already he and it was I believe south of this Lake was it or was it this Lake one of these Lakes what a great guess um okay this feels with these yellow outer lines again south somewhere in southern Africa um let's see we have some trees this time it's not like you don't get any trees in luru um but I think I think they might I might still go ludu here because the mountains look very bare um I mean this might be South Africa I don't think this is a stini um but I would I think I would go luru still with the white car and then Road lines it was luru yes nice um again same same location we're getting some repeats I me this is a map with not too many locations was it 206 or something somewhere here is nice okay let's do one more since we got two repeat in this one let's do one one more game um and let's see uh another unofficial one so again um not not not great what would this be even uh driving on the left side with yellow line in the middle looking like this I don't even know um which side do they drive on American Samoa um they were driving the which said were they're driving in American Samoa not sure actually I don't remember um when you can't remember which side you're driving on a a an option is to zoom in and see look for these arrows you can sometimes see them near like roundabouts maybe I don't know if there are any roundabouts here but um maybe this is just the US Virgin Islands and know you drive on the left side there let's let's maybe go there oh it was Bermuda well either way it was unofficial coverage so no point in learning those cars um this would be Guatemalan car uh and it even says Guatemala on the sign but even if it didn't uh this yeah this Google car uh you get in Guatemala yes yes so let's just just guess somewhere near the capital okay now okay this is uh the Dominic from Republic once more is this this is not the same exact location as before is it I maybe it is no it isn't is it no I think we had a bit slightly different one before um so let's go Santo Domingo this time and maybe it was the same one maybe it was uh again we're getting lots of luru wait is this luru where am I tripping we get the white Google car um sometimes Bolivia can look very similar to um let's sudu maybe it's just me but I've heard some other people getting confused by the two as well because they both can get white cars sun should be North in both of them mountains can look similar um so Bolivia and ludu can surprisingly look similar I'm not sure about the guard rails here what are the differences exactly uh I'm kind of thinking this might actually be bivia but maybe I'm just imagining things maybe this is just luru okay let's just go luru we've had so many lurus already let's just go luru again um it was just ludu again okay good I almost went Bolivia there another Dominican Republic um I was imagining that uh we would get some more exotic Google cars when starting to play this map I was thinking of maybe getting um like in southern Philippines there is one very interesting Google car and another like American Samoa and these um Islands here had some really interesting go car um so and of course Panama with the antenna and everything so um Google cars are definitely a really useful thing to learn if you want to learn the metas um I'm not sure if this map is the best for it but uh if you did learn something then then leave a like and check out this video on the right side which I think you will enjoy and you will learn some more things there huge thanks to all of my patrons and yoube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a

month a strange World which supposedly has 2,000 crazy locations official only know gen one I have not played it before I have no idea what kind of crazy locations are we going to get but if you want to play along of course the links as always will be in the description let's play with no moving and let's have let's have 2 minutes per round I I'll probably use less than that but but if you want some extra time you got it so let's go good luck to all of us oh gosh that's that is crazy and okay where where could we be looks very cool very Coastal no no houses no civilization in sight very nice looking where is the sun the sun is South is right oh gosh yall know I'm terrible at Coastal locations oh no um kind of redish soil um I was gosh I don't know what to think really like I don't think Brazil would be this like I was thinking up here but I don't think so but what else oh oh could this be ever is this is this tracker no this is a car um I don't know could this ever be like canaries or aor maybe maybe let's go canaries um I don't know which island this one maybe I think this is kind of with reddish soil maybe I'm very wrong uh water is to the east to the small island there no this is not a city we're not definitely not there that's a long shot but let's see what it is California Channel Islands National Park in in the US wow yeah this insane well I was very far away oh no I see what kind of a map this is going to be oh gosh but okay I'll do my best I'll do my best this is okay we see a lot of bird trees right off the bats they are are they bir trees they are yeah yeah yeah um but but but but but well the question is is this nordics is this Russia or is this North America huh what is this we have Gen 4 right this is I think this doesn't really feel like North America to me just by The Vibes I'm thinking could this be Russia I'm thinking maybe Russia but I'm very much not confident in my guess a little bit Healy is it Healy up here there are some heals up here as well right would it ever be there it's such a risky guess but then again it is a strange world map so maybe let's go somewhere there maybe even more North I think there are more Mountains North let's go there okay it was Russia I was right about the country I was very wrong about where in the country these locations are rough very rough well props to you if you if you did get it correctly easy easy for you to beat me on this map I got to say cuz my scores are just horrific but but let's just go with it this is a difficult map we have some um Arabic on that stop sign wait which country would this be what are those plates one of them appears to be black the other one is it blue this is like Jordan no some sort of a tricker I'm thinking I was thinking Jordan at first but I'm trying to figure out if it actually is or not well you get in Tunisia you get black Place wait yeah Tunisia makes more sense yeah yeah yeah with black plates Tunisia makes way makes way more sense than Jordan um Tunis and I think this I've seen a stop sign like this in Tunisia as well I think this has to be Tunisia then some some Christmas trees and sheep bow Christmas tree Christmas trees and sheep um I would I'm not sure like somewhere a little bit heilly here some hills um which parts are more hilly here in Tunisia as you probably know in Tunisia oh there are some mountains here so maybe somewhere there is the most coverage is along the east coast basically no coverage towards West so let's go somewhere there maybe there seem to be some mountains in that area oh there is oh interesting there is some coverage West more West at least I wonder if it's a new one or or just something that I haven't seen before interesting I wasn't aware there is coverage there to be honest but I'm happy with my guess there oh no oh no what is this this is somewhere in Greenland isn't it no sternan uh oh is this Greenland I know in Greenland you can sometimes get these this kind of bat coverages maybe I mean I was thinking Canada maybe but uh Nord Stern doesn't sound very English or French so anything else useful here Marine vest as I think this might be green and I think that's my best guess I got to say that this map does have some very difficult and interesting locations for sure locations that you don't usually see in the regular geoguesser games so let's go I don't know East West let's go West Somewhere In The Water maybe bit more North here is there coverage there I don't well I think there is some coverage up there let's see I was valard ahuh huh interesting I guess sard makes sense as well H I'm learning about all this new coverage I didn't know that swalo had that type of coverage or maybe I once knew when I had forgotten that's also possible as you know I don't have the best memory but salard yeah makes makes perfect sense too I just wasn't aware that that's a possibility with with Bo coverage like that all right oh no what are these locations they're so difficult oh no what is that thing but I don't think it helps this is where you just got a purely Vibe guess cuz uh there is nothing well I'm not going to recognize this tree species where they grow the leaves appear to be very green and juicy leaves leaves green and juicy leaves I'm thinking maybe Asia maybe Africa maybe leaning more towards Asia just by The Vibes cuz that's the only thing that I have to go on here so let's go I think maybe like Malaysia Thailand Indonesia that's that's what I'm thinking so let's go maybe Malaysia gosh Japan oh okay well yeah I fine there's nothing for me to to comment I guess it was Asia so one of the continents I considered was right so good oh no what's my total score 6500 that's rough that is rough uh but yeah let's do one more game by the way as you might have noticed I have this wonderful content creat badge which means that you can support me if you do buy anything in the asset store you can use code geop Peter and it supports my channel so yeah in case you do uh do that then then enter code geeter thank you but yeah let's move on to Strange World number game number two let's do that so same controls hopefully a better score um oh gosh okay we have some guide or someone showing us the way I guess but uh my first thought was feels quite Asian like Indonesia Vibes I'm getting here Indonesia Vibes the sun is kind of there somewhere appears to be more northish which would check out would work with Indonesia if this is Indonesia um I don't know which island it would would or could be because we're in the middle of a forest basically so let's go let's go with Sumatra maybe oh it was not Indonesia it was Cambodia o okay I was wrong about the country can the general area was right but well at least 12,00 points so that's something at least better start than the the first game now this was very North there no again but um where would this be salard again that's the thing I I haven't seen a coverage like this in salard before so I that wouldn't be my my my my main guess but I don't know that that b coverage made me question myself the houses could this be Canada like Northern Canada cuz the PO feel maybe more narrow than the European ones and like the just the the the architecture like I'm not super familiar with swart architecture by any means but just these houses feel kind of North American houses but more North if that makes sense if it makes sense so I'm thinking maybe Canada somewhere or or Alaska would have yellow plates so I don't think it's Alaska I think this would be Northern Canada somewhere that's my thinking but where I'm not entirely sure which which parts have coverage we have some water here as as as you can see any mountains where are the hilly Parts well I know BC is hilly so maybe we should go there but uh I think there were some Hill mountains heels here I don't know let's go BC I guess but or Northern ter let's go Northern ter Yukon sorry let's go Yukon maybe could it be Northwest Territories let's go Yukon cuz this I feel like it's more north than BC well well um it was very south not very north um that's painful well it was Americas but not the correct Americas all right it was very very Southern was it Chile it is Chile yeah oh some reason it felt like it's it's very North to me well zero points for me this this is a rough game rough map but I am actually enjoying it a lot even though my scores are just horrendous I am actually really enjoying this map so what do we have Ori Orient watches Orient watches here and some of course we have some um Arabic so that narrows it down a lot that do we see Arabic um wait is that a blue strip on that car what what what what oh yeah we do have blue strips wait what uh wait I'm confused I am confused where would they have blue strips humra something humra where do we have blue strips what that's a red plate okay I am very lost where are are we why do we have blue strips it's not turkey it's um Dr mtas venny vzy Dental Surgeon I'm I'm I don't know where to guess genuinely like what is this could this be UAE ever I I don't know those blue blue blue strips are throwing me off so hard like this wouldn't be tun easy surely but I don't know I'm going to just guess UAE but I'm I'm very not confident Lebanon I forgot Lebanon exists I forgot Lebanon exists oh my God that's embarrassing makes sense and I knew that be has some coverage okay yeah yeah yeah I'm not liking how I play today comp park parks par nationales which country though which country is this we have something Coastal would this be ever like not sure like we do we have front plates we don't have front plates would this ever be Puerto Rico is what I'm thinking I actually kind of like Puerto Rico here cuz we don't have front plates that's a big clue um this is tracker I think you definitely can get some triers there we have some Spanish which they do speak in Puerto Rico and we have some mountains which you can see in Puerto Rico so I think Puerto Rico is a good shout we have water to our South so let's go somewhere here near Pon maybe and let's see nice actually was has plunked more West at first but I'll take this I'm very happy I think we might have already beat yeah we have already beaten the um first game game score so let's go but let's see let's see oh oh what is this car uhoh my car knowledge my car knowledge what is this car is this American Samoa car I know they have different cars for different Islands I'm thinking was this one of the islands there maybe is what I am thinking so we have uh water to the kind of north northwest the road very small Road um so American Samoa would be here which island would it be I think it might be the this this bigger one maybe um I'm not 100% sure about the car though might be something else I don't remember how did the Colombian car look like I think these one of these islands had some car as well but I don't remember how that one looked but I think this is my best bet to go American Samoa let's see okay it was a different Island but it was American Samoa I will happily take it let's go okay much better score than the first game still not not perfect by any means but I'm I'm definitely more happy about this game than with the first one if you enjoyed the video press that like button and let me know in the comments how you did if you played along on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful

which is a popular map created by Harrier another YouTube content creator go check him out and yeah let's play a couple of games in this map see how it how it is I haven't played it before the links if you want to play the play along will be in the description Let's Play No moving I think the description set to Play No moving and yeah let's do minute and a half per round so let's go let's go I think it said it's mostly official coverage might be some photospheres all right okay what is that some sort of a flag that I do not know what language do we have Tas Tasman Island cruises are we in Tasmania we are driving on the left side here which would fit Tasmania yeah for sure is this like Hobart or something maybe could be we so we have water water kind of to the South it seems oh Hobart does have water kind of to the South somewhere here uh anything else anything else the road goes like that so feel like we might be on this bridge does the road I'm not super sure I'm not very sure although the road wait here I think we're on this this one yes now I'm now I'm more happy yes I think this should be it I forgot to pay attention to the birds oh my God the whole map is about birds and I didn't look at the birds at all where was the bird where this is a little bit different was that an older date was it 2019 no 2018 oh it was this one 2017 where is the bird where was the bird oh don't know uh-oh I think we missed out on Bird on this one I don't see the bird anywhere um okay let's move on where is the bird here should be there should be birds in every a bird in every location oh there it is hello found it found the bird on this one um okay this is wait there there's another one okay damn no something something okay no send where would this be well the language is Spanish right I think no send sounds very Spanish to me so um which count is had Gen 4 I think Colombia had some Gen 4 added right I should update my gen for knowledge cuz I think Chile had some gen for added Colombia also we don't see the is that a plate or no maybe not no I think it's just a leaf I kind of want to go maybe Colombia this doesn't feel like Chile and we have these uh these these these wooden fences which you see a lot in Colombia as well oh the time is running out let's go Colombia I feel a Peru like the houses felt maybe Peruvian I wasn't sure if Peru had Gen 4 or not well apparently it does so okay makes sense still felt quite Colombian to me to be honest but okay oh there's the bird okay oh what is it carrying some sort of a paper okay cool cool cool uh so this would be Kenya driving on the left side with a snorkel yellow back plate it's um now which city we do have some palm trees quite a lot of palm trees it seems which would make me think maybe Co maybe more Coastal wait what is that mishor is that a niala West mishor is any of that a city name mishor or niala mishor or niala mishor don't see misho anywhere though niala don't see niala anywhere either the time is running out I I think I'll still guess kind of coastal maybe um what was the road Direction not super helpful since they're in the city but let's get somewhere here maybe still kind of coastal but not not exactly on the coast ah it was more Coastal so I guess none of them oh M Moroni police station is that the like the area or of Mombasa or I'm not sure but okay it was Mombasa fair enough still I'm happy with my guest pretty close Rio do huh okay R this wait is this H is this Brazil I think right this sign felt very Brazilian to me and I think we do have blacks black back of the sign and doesn't look like the typical water container is there a water container I know you can get blue ones in Brazil um I think these these Chevrons also seem Brazilian to me so I would be inclined to go Brazil oh there is the bird oh is that a parrot very nice nice parrot colorful that's cool I think they there are some parrots that live in U Amazonian rainforest right surely surely um let's guess H let's guess somewhere yeah okay the time ran out but uh was a bit more south okay fair enough next ooh very different very Coastal first start was like uh Chile but Chile wouldn't work with the black car and the stripy Paul it would be Peru instead would be Peru instead so we are coastal well Peru has quite a long coastline so not super helpful but it does align with Peru with water being west west southwest so the question is where exactly wait where is the bird first of all oh they oh my God that's a lot of birds here oh gosh hello damn that's a lot of birds in up in here damn and is that all bird poop imagine huh well yep um I don't think there is a way for us to know exactly um is that some sort of a checkpoint border checkpoint or some sort of like um the place you pay for roads not sure it's to our kind of Northwest Northwest um I don't think border I don't think it's the Border let's go somewhere okay yeah it was about to say it's not here cuz there's a beach right here but uh it makes sense didn't feel like we were that that much into the city but okay was close enough pretty good guys what was what what was our my total 19.5 th000 the Colombian guess wasn't the best but but overall not not not the not the worst result let's do another one let's do another game don't forget to press that like button if you enjoy these play along along videos so I know to make more of them thank you very much for your support and let's see what do we get this time we see an Italian um license plate Italian front plate the narrow one with blue on both sides the bards are certainly interesting but I think they are with the black top they are Italian as well um very interesting looking Italy I got to say lots of water feels like we have water and mountains the nature almost feels Korean to me but but it's definitely Italy but where then where does Italy look like this I'm not sure actually would it be more south somewhere somewhere here where's the bird first of all I didn't even I forgot to check I don't see a bird how did we start oh wait we don't have the start cuz we play no move are those supposed to be the birds um I don't see any other birds here oh these hello oh flamingos okay I didn't know it has flamingos to be honest ah Sardinia makes sense ah okay it was Coastal ah interesting oh makes sense where we had so much water we have these roads going basically through the water there I hadn't seen those roads before I'm pretty sure cool and I learned that Italy has some flamingos I didn't know that before okay we have a bird in the sky and what is that animal how do you call them I'm not sure not really a cow but but but um is it bison no is it just are they no this is just a horse this isn't a horse I I don't know I don't know my animals uh what is this car is this a Kenyon um oh zebras um this is uh I think a Kenyan national park somewhere that's a oh that's a zebra not a horse makes sense but what are these let me know in the comments forgot what these are these bison is that an ele no I thought it's small elephant looks like with big ears but probably not uh anyways anyways my animal knowledge is not up to par clearly uh which national park would this be let's go not quite flat not very mountainous oops let's go it's not Mount Kenya National Park let's go somewhere more here and know there are some here like Ruma National Park let's go there nope it was down here amboseli National Park well it was a national park in Kenya I picked the wrong one we have oh a very colorful parro oh my gosh that's a pretty bird wow that's really pretty that's really pretty and this is Northern Australia right driving on the left side uh with these types of metal poles triangular ones oh that is so cool night Frank I don't think that helps as much but this is cool I like this very much what's the road Direction pretty vertical it seems H pretty vertical so where should we guess then somewhere here if it's pretty vertical might as well guess there since it's vertical there I'll take that that's a good guess that's a very good guess I'll take it now next round round number four where are the birds these ones that's those are very small birds toout track this immediately giving me Singapore Vibes the this font and this this green sign driving on the left side feels kind of quite rural Singapore which you can get despite its small size some parts can definitely feel very rural particular kind of Northern Northwestern part I think turut track is there a point of trying to find the name with that name turut track and we can have a quick look toout track toout track there's a different track there no not toot one no I don't think we're going to find it Well I didn't have high hopes of finding it anyways wait to track no is it here does it align wait it does I think does it I think right oh my God it does okay I'll take that uh okay cool cool cool I I enjoy getting 5Ks what can I say now okay what is this this feels weird for some reason lots of palm trees is this like Hawaii feels very tropical but something just feels different I don't know is this Hawaii or no I don't know the I don't know the plates we don't have the front plate and we have these round electricity counters why does this feel so weird I kind of am inclined to go Hawaii here but um that's a risky guess the houses are very pretty and big but or could this be Florida oh no I want to go Hawaii but I'm afraid this might be Florida okay let's go Hawaii oh no if it's Florida I would guess somewhere here maybe or even down here it was not that's why it felt weird that would be my second guess CU gosh darn it what a bad way to end the video I was doing so well up up until that point but that's an opportunity for you to beat my score so let me know in the comments if you managed to beat it and on the right side there will be another player long video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path":

going to play some play along games in the map that was used in the World Cup quickly before we start I want to say a big thanks to Lauren who is a backbone member on patreon thank you very much for your support the map is called an official world and I thought it could be fun to play the same modes that were played during the World Cup uh respectively uh let's start with one minute moving games game and then we'll move on to no moving and then nmp Z if you want to play along the links will be in the description and here we go what do we have this is an yeah Indonesian license plate driving on the left side as well so we would be in Indonesia um so we can move around so let's do that r Wait RI was a where was RI RI 07 was it yeah here was RI yes I thought 07s were here balis banga is that a city name balis saying there as well so somewhere in Ria Bales Bales Island balis somewhere okay I'll take that I'll take that that was a that I'm very happy I found I first of all that I knew where R is and that I found Bales pretty cool we start okay F uh first glance giving me big Ireland Vibes wide back plate the hous is looking like that generation two okay what do we have on this sign lack M Brook well I would say Ireland yeah probably with a back uh white back plate architecture would fit I mean we could try to find a sign or something but I think we might as well just guess yeah let's just guess uh let's guess somewhere here okay fair enough not too bad ooh what is this now feeling maybe H I don't know not entirely French could this be not sure like Slovenia oh czechia maybe what is this sign oh no is it is it actually France PES beIN is this France can we get closer to that laforce any there is a domain name that is blurred out.com plus 32 is the France or could this be Belgium by any chance Belgium I mean Belgium can get a little bit Healy 32 gosh I should know which country is 32 okay it was Belgium it was Belgium yeah that's why I I guess close to the Border yeah okay fair enough cuz I wasn't that sign kind of felt like a Belgian design not really French entirely but the plate didn't seem that redish to me which you often see in Belgium so had some mixed feelings there um okay we have small license plates is what I'm noticing oh and of course of course we have the Guatemala Google car visible as well um so any city names or something Z is zuleta a city I have no idea let's go so we have like a mountain to our East H let's go do we have a mountain to the West yes let's go somewhere here then in in the mountains oh more East halapa okay that is looks like a Black Blade is this Tunisia or something it is Tunisia okay we do have the follow car okay well somewhere in Tunisia um I don't remember which follow cars were in which regions you can use the follow cars to help region guest tesia um but but I don't remember which ones were where I mean I'm inclined to kind of hedge to go either Seuss or Fox somewhere there because as you probably know most of the Tunisia coverag is on the East Coast okay a little bit more North nabul well close enough I thought it was a good game 23.8 th000 I'll take that pretty good and let's move on to another game this time with no moving so again one minute per round no moving uh let's go okay this feels like a Belgian Pole from the first glance the sign feel Belgium to me as well I would go Belgium here yeah I would go Belgium not very Healy doesn't feel like it at least so let's go like somewhere so this this part is more hilly in Belgium so maybe somewhere here okay yeah close to brussles very good start very good start okay New Zealand driving on the left side these bards the feels very qiwi as well now um what do we see some mountains some sheep mountains and sheep very kiy Rolling Hills here those don't really look like Rolling Hills to our West though they look snowy and High um if they are to our West maybe we be somewhere could it be somewhere here maybe could could I know I don't think so ah somewhere here maybe let's go somewhere here uh north of the southern island ah it was even more south it was south of the southern island well it was kind of this Coast but I I got the um area completely wrong now this would be UA I believe with a white car looking like this very Sandy very Sandy um I don't see any mountains so I think this would probably be on the west or or North Coast it wouldn't be here I don't think cuz these these areas are very mountainous and up here as well so maybe somewhere near sharja what's the RO Direction Let's see goes like that goes like that and turn South and turn South we don't have much time somewhere I don't know I know it was more North on an island huh oh yeah oh well interesting place didn't could we see the water I didn't see the water um okay so okay this is Japan I don't know those those what those plates mean I know you can use these the region gu I don't know them too many of them to for me to learn but if you do learn them they can be quite helpful with region guessing so I've heard and also the pole tops as well supposedly you can use those to reach and guess too um okay where shall I guess here I am not sure let's go maybe more Southern just going by The Vibes somewhere here near okama maybe okay it was more Central but not not not the worst guess could be could be worse for sure oh and we are finishing this game with some us of a we have a flag country that sign there okay I don't know I don't know the US plates so that doesn't help do we have front plates here do we see any cars front I think we do have front plates the architecture is giving me maybe more north northern Vibes should we risk it and guess there I wanted to switch to West Virginia but I was too late God darn it I think West Virginia does not have front plates but but I should have switched to Virginia then but yeah was was too little time would have been a great guess if I actually gone with went with Virginia 21.1k I'll take that not bad not bad a bit worse than than the moving game but still decent and last but not least we have the nmz no moving panning zooming again Link in the description of course let's see how how how bad it gets we have Japan again huh and of this we have this Ballard the camera feels low and yeah somewhere in Japan don't know much more than that let's go again kind of Central or Southern I'm feeling let's go somewhere here okay very close to okama my previous guess would have been insane but okay this is this is very good as well now okay driving on the right side wait a minute which Which con is this this is Europe right it has to be but I was considering Argentina there for a second but no this feels like like Romania or something to me I feel it has to be somewhere there like Romania maybe what else could it be like I can't read the language there unfortunately that could be helpful on that sign but I think Romania would be a decent guess maybe Bulgaria or something but I'm I'm relatively happy with guess ing Romania here let's get somewhere there a it was Serbia very close to Romania but got the country wrong unfortunately not sure what gave Serbia away there oh okay wait wait wait wait wait we have uh a windmill there we have those those street signs is this oh gosh is this Sweden or Finland oh no oh no that sign yellow sign you can get both in Sweden and Finland maybe feeling more Swedish here to be honest but uh kind of kind of More Southern Sweden maybe oh no jeen shiing no it's not Jean shiing but may be near there somewhere oh no let's see ah okay it was gotland okay not not a bad guess though I was close wasn't on the island but close okay on the left side we can see yeah you can see as well the Peruvian street sign so you get these these thick stripey poles in Peru landscape like this doesn't feel well we don't get much um vegetation here but it doesn't feel like super super dry like it does in the South I don't know maybe maybe my vibes are off but I'm thinking maybe maybe a bit more North because of that somewhere here okay okay well not as North but wasn't super South either okay um now this feels like New Zealand to me are those oh no are those Australian ballards wait what is this Australia um wait where in Australia would it look like this so so kiwi I'm confused fused I don't know Australia that well like somewhere I mean there are some hills here and and it's very green would it be somewhere around there maybe closer to Sydney let's go okay maybe I don't know I don't know okay let's guess here is in Victoria and and let's see oh it was near very near adelade oh okay I wasn't thinking there okay fair enough I'm I'm happy I guess the country at least recognize the bards cuz my first thought was New Zealand there 21,000 that's a that's a really good score better than I expected to be honest but if you played along let me know in the comments what are your scores were and press that like button to

"hello and welcome back to another geoguessr satellite view video where we are gonna try to recognize places from above and in this video we're gonna play a map called our fascinating planet I recently did a Play Along video looking playing it regularly uh and I thought let's play it from above as well see how we do um the play along link will be in the description the only thing is that the unity script might be broken it wasn't working on my other browser it is working on this one so um yeah let's see how it does uh if you can play along uh the link is in the description so here we go let's see what do we get what do we get let's close that okay we get something Coastal something big oh that is a big city isn't it um I do not recognize it uh immediately looking from above with this angle with with water to North Northwest uh let's zoom in closer what continent would this be oh that's a is that meant to be like a football stadium maybe with uh like a a roof that can be closed what okay which side are we the the Shadows are going to the north so we are in the northern hemisphere which had already driving on is the question here okay it looks like we are driving on the right side rubbing in the right side no driving on the left side never mind this this this Highway made me think of the right side but no the the street lines would indicate left side driving here uh so would this be like Japan then we do have mountains here Japan is quite mountainous uh lots of coast so I think Japan might be a good Shout with such a big city we have like an airport here as well we have a some sort of a stadium any writing maybe don't see any writing at all unfortunately what what what I am thinking Japan maybe let's see if we can align something what could it be with water like that Sapporo no it was doesn't work okay it is Fukuoka okay okay it is Fukuoka now the islands are lie and everything aligns very good a very big city I didn't realize work was so so big I wonder what's the population so our location we're looking for is right here on the kind of western part of the city um how do we align this we have the highway going here so this highway I think we have a river is it this River here or we have the railroad there okay here is that River here is the baseball field right here and we are on this road somewhere like around here we have the house we are right like here great round okay okay okay we got a forest and something mountainous it felt like oh this looks so cool from above all these forests and you can see how how hilly they are that's really cool but that doesn't help us much with figuring out where we are though so oh wow there is like a big big volcano here like mountain probably a dormant volcano maybe oh but we don't get is that a it's a small City I mean it's better than nothing what are these colors is that a camera glitch or or are people celebrating something colorful there what is that I don't think it's a camera glitch I think it's like some some colorful tents or something really looks really weird from above I wonder what's happening there if you know let me know in the comments what looks very interesting that's for sure uh the Shadows are going south yeah Shadows are going south which would indicate southern hemisphere um are we driving on the left side again or no it looks like we might be driving on the left side which is the one I want to make sure I want to make sure because I'm thinking this might be Indonesia that's that's my thinking I just wanna I wanna figure out which side we're driving on first yeah it's really hard to tell but it looks like this car would be driving on the left side and and the house is look like they might be Indonesian and uh another reason why I think Indonesia would fit is that it does have a lot of volcanoes uh Indonesia depending on how you count them Indonesia is arguably has the most active volcanoes um in the world so yeah that's that's something to to know um I'm guessing this is probably a lake or maybe it's it's like um I don't know how you call those in English uh obey I guess uh maybe but but but but this be Java let's see if we can maybe find like a a big lake like this maybe or or a a bay like that maybe somewhere here no Oh I thought of me I might have it but no that's not it the shape is different unfortunately another thing is that it's hard to like figure out how large the lake would be on the map it feels like it should be large but how large is this big enough or is it too large or too small but something I always struggle with in go oh I think it is it I think it is it I think the shape matches perfectly Lake [Music] sink karak and we do have a town to North East as always and we are right in the middle of a pretty big intersection so it shouldn't be too too hard to pinpoint I think this is the intersection here um I think it is okay let's guess there then oh okay I was getting worried there uh since I was struggling with the finding that Lake but uh persistent space and was it it was barely on the very border of the like in the southern hemisphere but yeah the sun goes up and down so so it makes sense you could get Shadows going to the South even if you're in the northern hemisphere theoretically all righty then what is next some sort of farming Fields feels more European right off the bat with all these forming fields and everything yeah feels very European thinking looks looks quite flat looks quite flat so I was thinking like the Netherlands or something but uh let's let's let's have a closer look um and see the roofs don't feel that Dutch to me I don't think but then again I'm not the best uh with with roof uh with separating different types of roofs uh we're doing on the right side no surprises there we have a some lakes here and there because this is the biggest one that we have but it's not even that big I don't think it's worth trying to find it if we don't know the country um so the roofs are making me feel like we have a church here I was thinking maybe like Italy could it ever be um would never be Italy or Bulgaria or somewhere in between somewhere there Croatia maybe um I'm thinking that that region somewhere but I'm not very sure at all would be really nice if we could find some some stadium with texts or or something with texts but you don't get texts for looking from above very often unfortunately we have a very small River here which wouldn't help really but but but but but I guess our best shot is to try to find a small lake with this shape which sounds like a long shot let's try because the shape is quite unique I'll I'll give it that if I do see a lake like that then then I should recognize it yeah I don't know I've looked in the countries I thought it was I guess I didn't look in Serbia we can scan Serbia as well but again the issue is I'm not sure how like should I look at this size Lake sorry should I look at a little bit bigger ones like that that doesn't work so yeah Hungary maybe could be hungry as well why not I guess yeah we're running out of time very quickly and I don't know I feel like I might wanna guess hungry because it's nice and sort of in the middle of of what I'm thinking it might be somewhere here maybe Northern Serbia or hedging purposes yeah not sure well let's just guess it's not like I'm gonna find it in 40 seconds it was Germany huh huh okay so I was in the wrong area could I have found that like in Germany I mean it was findable I don't think I would have looked so near to Leipzig though since we did not see that City uh right I'm pretty sure we didn't see it oh well that's that's a bit unfortunate but what can you do can't get 5Ks every time very mountainous area this time very very mountainous very pretty Shadows are going north so it would be in the Northern Hemisphere and we get a small town oh like I'm immediately getting like uh Norwegian Town Vibes I'm thinking maybe could this ever be Switzerland um maybe maybe maybe these are Alps I was thinking maybe these are Alps I was thinking Norway at first but but now that I'm thinking the second time maybe these could be Swiss roofs you'd think I would be better at Rules by now I've played satellite view so many times I still struggle with European rules um yeah the more I look at these houses the more they feel maybe like uh Swiss or French or some somewhere in that area and I don't think we're gonna find any good other Clues here it's a small mountain town it's not gonna have stadiums with with big texts or anything like that um I guess we can look around maybe we find some other cities or towns okay there is another small one but yeah looks pretty much the same as the other one I imagine it would be it is very beautiful there uh living there pinpointing this would be will be horrible though because there are no big like points of interest would you call them like nothing really to pinpointed by um well we know it's somewhere in the mountains that's about it somewhere in the mountains and the city is kind of stretched horizontally this one at least and this city or town whatever you want to call it is stretched vertically and this River there's a small river that flows through let's try finding it if it is here even might be somewhere else after all yeah the the the more I look at the map the more I realize there is zero chance I'm finding this like absolutely none with all these small mountain towns look the same and and and no shot I'm aligning this like it like it looks like it might be around here um I think it's yes in Switzerland but like it just as easily could be somewhere more more south somewhere here maybe but uh although it looks like in this area there are some horizontally stretched down some vertically stretched ones as well oh wow okay it was not where I was looking the mountains looked pretty high uh correct me if I'm wrong but I think in this area the mountains are higher than here right maybe maybe I'm wrong but but that's why I was thinking that there um Yeah well yeah as I said no chance I would have found this absolutely none so I don't even feel that bad about not not getting that one um and last but not least round number five also looks very tricky well going into this map I expected this to be really tricky because these locations uh aren't always in cities in big cities or anything like that so I expected it to be possibly quite Rural and tricky so I'm I'm definitely doing better than I than I thought I would be going in but the game isn't over yet we have a small town okay um with with with with lots of houses and Sandy Rhodes Shadows are going to the South I'm trying to figure out the continent here trying to figure out the continents um quite Healy and we are we are coastal we are coastal with like another mountain or volcano hmm is there any way to tell which side we're driving on here I'm thinking could this be Africa somewhere like South Africa it would be really good to to see if we are driving on the left side here or not or would this be something else like I don't know like could this ever be Brazil like I know Brazil Coastal Brazil can be quite can't get quite um mountainous as well but I I couldn't figure out which which side we are driving on here I'm not sure I'm not sure let's try to align it maybe maybe thinking more Brazil um yeah I don't think South Africa aligns that well here I don't think let's head to Brazil instead maybe um the thing is we don't see any big cities around here only this tiny one I guess there is like more houses to the West this isn't a very big city either can we maybe figure out which side we're driving from here and that is some blue roofs here and there but this ever be Asia somewhere could this ever be Indonesia again I wasn't thinking that before but but maybe with the blue roofs oh gosh this is tricky this is tricky this doesn't feel Indonesian to me no I don't think so there are some small coastal towns ah I don't know I don't know like I couldn't align neither Brazil North South Africa hmm the Indonesia also doesn't look promising now this couldn't be Japan with shadows going to the South I feel like I'm I'll go somewhere in Brazil after all because that's my best guess but nothing really aligns so yeah I'm I don't know I don't know where this is no idea I might be missing something obvious I don't know um thinking could this ever be like somewhere in Asia but but I don't know where like maybe you should switch Indonesia last second fine let's switch to Indonesia I don't know maybe it is but uh let's see it was Indonesia after all okay oh there it was the the coast yeah I scanned over but but but maybe if I was thinking Indonesia from the very get-go maybe I could have found it but I don't know this one felt tricky to me as well more than 20 000 points not too bad if you play it along let me know in the comments what is your score and don't forget to press the like button on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy and huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this

planet with different fascinating elements all around the world interesting locations architecture wonders Etc so should be an interesting map I'm excited to try it out the play along links as always will be in the description so feel free to play along let's say the time limit two minutes now moving uh good luck good luck to everyone let's see what do we find in this map I haven't played it before so I'm excited to see so uh we have European plates first of all we also have these um stone walls which whenever I see these stone walls I'm thinking Mediterranean in particular Malta and as you can see we are driving on the right side based on the steering wheel so I am quite sure this should be Malta also this cacti this cacti you see well I've noticed they're mostly in Italy southern Italy Malta and Mexico you can see them somewhere else sometimes but mostly in those three countries so yeah those cacti can be quite helpful they have helped me in the past before we have some um a huge golf ball looks like some sort of like a like a observation tower meteorological station something I imagine so the road is like that um water is to our sour like west southwest now I probably won't be getting a 5k but we can try to align stuff at least somewhat maybe yeah the time is almost up I'm gonna go somewhere you know let's go the Northern Ireland maybe not sure I it was the southern island after all uh dingley cliff Chapel with views nearby okay but it was Malta was a close guess so I'm happy with that now uh let's see what do we get now we have a colorful car very colorful colorful car and appears we are driving on the left side the signs are on the left side the car is driving on the left side and yeah so would this be Indonesia or Malaysia or Thailand or what would this be what would this be with yellow lines in the middle I would be more inclined to go Thailand maybe because because usually Thailand will have yellow lines in the middle although I although rarely but you can see I think I have seen yellow lines in Indonesia as well but that's that's not very common there I feel they've blue roofs which everyone doesn't help too much what's with the car the sign I feel like you can see these rectangular signs in Thailand as well so I'm thinking Thailand there is a motorcycle I can't see if we have the front plate there or not can't know this one at least so still Thailand would be my best guess Batman I just now noticed the Batman there oh and there is another Batman okay someone's a big fan of a Batman here well for his own safety I hope he isn't driving like this oh no the steering goes on this side right so I guess the car is just sitting there in the middle of the road it was not Thailand it was Indonesia after all hmm yeah I had a sneaky feeling it might be Indonesia but just based on the road lines decided to trust those Road lines was kalimantan after all ah yeah yeah yeah okay never mind let's let's move on let's move on what do we see bancario Guayaquil when Guayaquil was a city in like uh yeah Ecuador here it was um doesn't mean we are necessarily in that City it's just Bang from there dot EC I mean that checks out that EC uh so would this be Ecuador then let's just look around for a little bit more is this actually Ecuador because I was getting big Peruvian Vibes to be honest before I saw that that sign oh wow that's a big parrot there very cool Monument [Music] I don't know those plates I know in Peru you can get a lot of cars like uh tuk-tuks and these houses like that can we spot an electricity counter somewhere that would be very helpful because because Peru and Ecuador do have different ones I feel like these might be ah I really want to go Peru here I don't know it might be a really silly guess since we have the Ecuador domain name and a bank name and just feels so Peruvian with all these tuk-tuks and houses like this only we could spot an electricity got a rear running out of time I want to go Northern Peru I want to go Northern Peru let's go somewhere here I don't know might be a bit too Green for their uh somewhere but is it it was just like whatever ah I decided to risk it for the best kitten and should have just gone guys Quail I shouldn't risk so much should just go with with the with the hints that we get instead of going by The Vibes because everything felt so Peruvian to me there um okay we have a kirkey's car with a nice very Blue River by us so hmm okay let's see if we can find a river somewhere that could work there is a river here the river is to our kind of south and east south and east somewhere here maybe does that somehow align could we be somewhere um no I don't know I feel this River might be it but but it might be hard to align it properly though but let's let's go somewhere there and it was not it that was not it unfortunately okay yeah there is another River here which also folks yeah very very nice uh oh okay we have some um I think not Thai doesn't look like it feels like mayor so this I would think is Cambodia and uh very red soil very dark soul you can see that in Cambodia too this is an interesting Pole and uh two two would would the pieces bonded together samples kind of remind me of Myanmar a bit but I guess you get them all over Southeast Asia I mean Encore what as well so maybe somewhere near there nearby um I don't know let's get somewhere that area hey it was very Coastal actually didn't feel that Coastal to me Masa Pagoda it was overall a thousand eh definitely could have been a could have had a better score there I wasn't particularly happy with many of my guesses that Ecuador one was a silly one decided to risk it and uh yeah but let's play another one let's play another one let's see um if we can get a better score they're interesting locations I do like the locations in this map for sure not too difficult but but always something interesting like this is a very interesting looking tunnel carved in a big piece of piece of rock very cool looking I gotta say so we have a white middle lines here and the bigger clue is that we have the um black sign on the pole which you get in in Mainland Malaysia yeah so I'm not I haven't studied these these signs how to tell the regions apart I don't know that but I know you can study those black signs as well to pop your region guess Malaysia Mainland Malaysia but yeah I haven't done that I'll just go buy The Vibes very hilly very mountainous very beautiful really really beautiful feels like almost like a quart or something um I don't know I don't know where might be somewhere Coastal but that doesn't help too much let's go near Epoch maybe seems like it is hilly there and it is near a coast so let's go that area oh okay so okay makes sense why it felt Coastal it was very Coastal and it was the island Islands that's where it was very beautiful looking really really beautiful would like to visit some so many places I would like to visit one day but never have time for anything so what the trees what the trees are here I guess these are the Woody trees okay and the rest area so this would be Australia I imagine but where why is that sign facing that direction who is this sign for but for the trees interesting okay um quite a red soil small trees feels very arid I'm thinking could this ever be something like Northern Territory or Northwestern Australia maybe somewhere I'm not the best with region guessing Australia not at all I I'm usually not the best at Region guessing any country but but Australia is not an exception for that so let's go somewhere this area maybe I imagine maybe somewhere there or maybe it's like Queensland somewhere here I know there is some coverage in that area and it always feels weird so maybe somewhere here I don't know let's see well it quite literally was there yeah well that would have been my second guess oh there were Woody trees well I did not zoom in that in that closely in but but if I had zoomed in on that particular spot I could have noticed it maybe um [Music] not too many points but I am happy that I can at least consider that area so I'll I'll take that at least okay we have a very interesting looking sign okay what would this be okay we have blue on both sides here would this be Italy I I think Italy yeah Italy does have dark sign backs so that checks out I definitely could see this being Northern Italy for sure this uh displayed especially um anything else that we can use the sign this side of the sun also feels like it could be Italy I feel like Italy does have a design sign design like that and the house architecture also feels like it could be Northern Italy and mountains of course beautiful water well I'm happy to go Northern Italy here so let's go somewhere there um nope I feel like there's no point in the lining I mean we could try to find a big Dam well a small dam like this but but so I feel like it's a lot of hassle to to try to pinpoint that there are so many small lakes up here so that would take a lot of time and we only have 25 seconds to do that anyway so let's go somewhere up here and uh and and let's go here and see aha well it was Northern Italy just a different part okay there was that damn okay it was a damn right at least it looked like it um okay okay uh Jeju okay Jeju art part I know where Jeju is well obviously this is South Korea and Jeju is this island down here Jeju Island and Jeju City and uh so I guess we're somewhere there World Park a live Museum okay interesting interesting I don't know where were any of those places are what was this Jeju Art Park is one kilometer could be anywhere though Jeju Swiss Village oh my God that sounds intriguing Jeju Swiss Village Snoopy Garden where is the Art Park I don't see the art park anywhere the museum Arte Museum Jeju I'm guessing that's an art museum why is it art I don't know but chocolate museum is somewhere here as well so what is the um raw Direction like that then it splits into two no it wouldn't be here let's go somewhere here ish somewhere uh maybe it wasn't that art museum I guess where is the art museum here I don't know well at least it was the Jeju Island so the points are good at least so round five last round of this game we have blue on both sides on this plate so which would mean Infinity love my Bella how romantic uh English graffiti in Italy I believe right I think I don't think this would be Albania would it the Bella makes me think Italy the graffiti mentioning Bella of the Silver B Albania I mean Albania could have blue on both sides as well I wouldn't be too surprised if this was Albania though I'm I'm a little bit torn let's go I don't know I the more I think about it the more I think this might be of Amy but I will be going Italy after all um I don't know the polls but but let's go kind of southern south east literally like somewhere like it is somewhat hilly here I think so let's go somewhere there if it is Albania we won't be too far either but I think it might be it was Albania after all just the capital Not My Brightest Day I feel like the scores are fine I got 20 000 points but um well I made some

things and I think we're ready to go good luck everyone good luck okay so we are starting off with a city with a town oh oh my God that's okay it's a big city it didn't didn't feel that big at first um but but but but okay is this Tokyo I feel like I remember seeing Tokyo from above and I eat having these uh docs or whatever you want to call them and also it would explain why it's so enormous I would love to visit Tokyo um such a huge City would like to experience it you know uh the Sun the Shadows are going to the north I just want to check which side we're driving on but I I think it should be Tokyo so let's just try to figure figure the driving side out quickly we have okay I didn't think didn't figure out the driving side but we have some what appears to be Japanese symbols so let's just let's just align it with Tokyo um does it does it fit does it work yes yes it does fit yes it does work so we are on this little island uh this one where exactly quite Coastal so what's what sport is there like um what is that place is that um it's not an Airfield is that a port where is it in this map I'm not entirely sure what's the Border here um in particular maybe it says on this on the map a signaling station this one is okay so we are like here but yeah we should be right there yes we are very good start very good start pretty easy start okay this we have some water here again oh let's close this one so it doesn't show oh yeah we have a coast I like getting coasts in these maps from above because I feel like those locations are usually easier than something inland I I do not recognize this city off the bat though feels European from the first glance but let's have a look so we have a pretty big city of course as as we can see we have a pretty big airport as well with multiple runways so the the place we are looking for is the airport itself but but but but but but where are we drawing on the left side again or no looks like we might be yeah we are driving on the left side here okay uh the Shadows are going to the north so would this be um could this be Ireland maybe is this Dublin OH Dublin does have a river going through like this with lots of small Bridges yes I think it's Dublin I think it's Dublin driving on the left on the left side also would fit perfectly yeah yeah here we go well we have this River what's the name of the river a leafy never heard of it in my life but that's River leafy apparently but we are looking for the airport up here so let's head there where is it so we have all these all these roads and we are like here in in the building itself oh really difficult to align it properly um maybe okay wait we have this thing so maybe more like here this one's terrible for aligning because the shape doesn't match entirely what we see so I hope it's a 5K oh it is thank god oh with 26 meters I thought it's not gonna be I thought okay but yeah good um the quality isn't the greatest let's zoom out what do we have oh this is giving me kind of like um Greenland Vibes or something oh that that's all we get oh my God what is this is this like an airport it is an airport here a very small one as you would expect um I'm giving you getting a like Greenland vibes that's my first thought could this maybe ever be um Norway we have these houses these kind of feel like Nordic houses that you would see in um Norway Greenland anything else so the road lines appear to be all white think it's really hard to see the quality is not good that I think they are all white we're driving on the right side I feel like this might be really tricky to align so we are looking for um somewhere up here maybe because it looks like we have a big land to our kind of waste wait where's the compass like this I guess the compass Direction depends on that location how it would be aligned but from above yeah it should always be North to to the north um so yeah anyways uh because of this land to our West I'm thinking maybe somewhere this area I don't know if that would align so and if there are any towns that would work somewhere here maybe oh I think we got it I think we got it I was looking for this thingy um this was kind of a unique shape and I think we have it here sadelo and we do have a bigger island to our West we have a no oh is it there's just nuke it's just Luke it felt smaller than it than this I thought nude unook was bigger uh but okay it's just just nuke apparently okay I was just complicating things apparently okay this is nuke International Airport and we are looking for this building right here the main one I imagine very nice very nice another perfect score I feel like the locations we've been getting are not the most difficult ones but I I enjoy them a very much okay now we have River like I was when starting this map uh playing this map I was expecting to maybe have more land borders because thus far we've been getting a lot of like ports and airports which are easier but not exactly what I expected to be honest um but yeah anyway so let's let's keep playing it though because I'm enjoying this uh yeah this is a very big city I don't have any good guesses from off the bat so let's zoom in see which side we're driving on and all all that good stuff these are some really what is that is that like what we have a parking lot in the middle what are those what are those I'm so confused at first I was thinking that's a stadium huge one but no it makes no sense no okay we have smaller stadiums that don't really help we are driving on though on which side is it left side it looks like it is left side yeah yeah we are driving on the left side I'm thinking Japan maybe I'm getting kind of Japanese Vibes possibly but yeah I feel the rules could fit maybe Japan I feel it's always difficult to tell from above to me at least because I'm not used to seeing all the rules and everything from above but I feel like they could fit they're not super uniform but but by the colors and everything I could imagine them being in Japan I think we have a stadium here with no texts no writings we have an American football field or something maybe just maybe just like a regular Stadium it feels like quite a lot of greenery we have a large batches of green lots of forests which is always nice to see lots of parks as well smaller ones so that's nice that's nice so is this Japan is this Japan so we have a pretty big airport here again is that where we're trying to pinpoint or what is this how is this a border I'm confused I is this is this a port um okay well let's try to align this with Japan we have a smaller Islands here very small ones and this might be a good clue like this side of this bigger island to the east so let's see does anything in Japan a line does this fit it's not exactly the same shape and we do have a river but that River that's it a line I'm confused it's similar but I don't think so yeah no no no no but the whole layout and everything was quite similar so so I thought it might be it I don't see anything that works done then I don't think um I'll look again okay we are kind of running out of time and I have not found uh what we're looking for so that's not great is this Japan what else could it be if it's not Japan maybe I'm just just terrible at aligning things I'm trying the left side like Malaysia Indonesia the Shadows did go to the north right wait the Shadows are going to the South oh my God what a big Overlook By Me is This South Africa or Australia or Australia I think I feel this might be Australia then because the city looks like I feel like it aligns better with water to the north west is this like Brisbane or something or just Sydney okay it is Brisbane oh my God okay I thought I did did check the sun Direction but I guess it was the previous round oh mixed up my rounds okay okay okay okay oh if I'm glad I figured this one out in a timely manner because I would have been not happy wouldn't be happy if I if I didn't recognize this one what is this speech Reserve oh how is that a border I'm confused with some of these locations in this map so we have this circle here is it this that Circle or oh it's this here then it's that this circle so we are here okay nice okay this was a tricky one well for me at least it took me a while to figure it out okay is this an actual non-city border okay this one looks like it actually is a border off of a land border between two countries okay now this was what I was expecting to see in this map so I'm glad there are locations like that here as well that's good so which two countries is the big question we are driving on the right side of the road good I guess so yeah any symbols any texts that we can read um not entirely sure what to think I'm thinking maybe something like tall like Cambodia but then one one of the one of the sides would be driving on the left side entirely Thailand or could it be Cambodia Laos border somewhere I'm not sure not sure and wait we did have water as well right we do have water I'm not entirely sure if it is a an ocean like a sea or a big it wouldn't be a big river with it a little bit hilly a little bit Healy what could it be Malaysians would be driving on the left side South couldn't be South Korea North Korea for sure so which direction does the sun go north okay good to know good to know feels like we might have some yellow middle lines potentially and we definitely have water is this Europe this feels like Italy wait a minute is is this is this Europe actually I'm so confused wait if this was Italy wait could this be no oh my god um at first I thought Asia now I'm thinking like Italy Croatia maybe somewhere here somewhere here here we have five minutes to pinpoint this um well at least I'm quite certain it is Europe now should have focused on the the towns at first instead of looking at the border buildings I am feeling like like Adriatic Sea or or something around here could it be like Albania and Greece something here or maybe here is it actually here is this polache it is it is the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina it is wait where is that border exactly so Northeast of bloche somewhere up here I think we have that road yes here right here I think oh I don't think I've been on that road I have like been in a on a bus in this area but I think we went down this road on the coast but I've been very close to that area once or was twice when I came back as well um but anyways it is a 5K perfect game let's keep this video short but don't you worry more satellite view videos are coming and press that like button to let YouTube know that you enjoy them as well on the right side there will be another satellite view video I think you will enjoy and huge thanks all of my

viewers a varied world so um looks really interesting and and quite a few plays as well supposedly his only official coverage 70 000 hand-picked locations which is crazy uh that's that's a lot of a lot of time and commitment to make this map so I'm excited to try it out and supposedly good mix of different types of locations so if you want to play it along as well the links will be in the description so you can see how you do um how I do and then yeah so let's play No moving no yeah no moving but with panning and zooming that's what I wanted to do two minutes per round and let's go let's go let's see what do we get what do we get okay I'm getting a rural location of the BET definitely Europe sun to the South as well what's with a pole hmm I do not recognize the whole uh my first thought was something like Bulgaria Romania something like that somewhere in that area I don't see any good Clues just very flat super flat so Northern Bulgaria Southern Romania somewhere there maybe let's see okay I'll take it it was Northern Bulgaria pretty good now what is this what is this well this feels like America or Canada and also these you see these poles in America North America these these little thingies and yeah of course the what's with that sign that's an interesting one um oh I guess the paved Road becomes a-n-n gravel roads ahead I don't remember ever seeing that sign before um but yeah somewhere I can see the sea being either us or Canada maybe I'm leaning a bit more towards Canada I don't know the house kind of feels maybe something like New Brunswick I don't know just Vibe guessing at this point okay not a bad Vibe not a bad Vibe it was Prince Edward Island which isn't too far from New Brunswick nice pretty good start oh gosh is this India it is India oh no well I know it's India I have no idea where in India it is we have this script with the with the horizontal line um go like on top which is mostly used in Northern India and uh yeah mostly you can also when you zoom in on the map you can see like which scripts are used where mostly yeah that the horizontal line is more towards north in Bangladesh as well of course but but this is in Bangladesh and more towards South you get this kind of Wiggly more Wiggly script and I saw I'm sorry I don't know the proper names for for all of these um but let's go I guess near New Delhi maybe you know a little east of it the like if it's close Gateway is close to New Delhi a bit more North but I'm fine with this guess India is a big country not too bad the coverage there isn't the highest quality if it was it would be really really cool now what is this we have a yellow line I don't know what this this thingy on the Google car no don't know that meta no what is that pole yeah I'm not sure about this one to be honest not sure about this one I was thinking like hmm not sure at all Mexico maybe I don't really see those poles properly but nothing maybe Brazil but can we see where the sun is not really somewhere behind the clouds doesn't help I'm thinking yeah Mexico or Brazil I don't know about this car kind of leaning more towards Mexico maybe maybe that's a big maybe because I really don't know uh will this ever be us I'm not sure maybe I would go Mexico still though let's go kind of here-ish ah Bolivia I actually like those polls kind of actually reminded me of Bolivia but I didn't say anything because I thought Bolivia wasn't a good option I didn't feel like Bolivia to me okay if I had seen this car then I would have not gone Mexico at least but but those poles like uh I think in this area like somewhere here uh down this road you can maybe see I wasn't sure if those are these poles or not I guess they were if you see these kind of um like like like these these Wiggly poles you might think that you might think it's a camera glitch but no those poles are actually like that those poles are actually Wiggly and not straight not completely straight so if you see those poles you would be in this area to get a self off ah Santa Cruz here's another Wiggly pole so yeah that's that's just a cool thing so I I for a second I thought is it that pole but I couldn't see it that well and car didn't feel Bolivian so yeah didn't go with Bolivia after all uh this is a Peruvian electricity counter um so we would be in per room uh huaman no idea where that is a hurricane like I would is that a city or is akorake a city or are they both cities maybe I can try to find one of them maybe yeah I can't find anything so let's just go somewhere somewhere here in the mountains very dry somewhere here ish okay A bit more North all right not too bad not too but how did I do in total 17 000. ah I feel like my guesses were pretty good besides that Bolivia one I'm kinda I know it a little bit at myself that I didn't get that one correctly but it's okay um let's go for another game which will also be in the description in the description play along if you would like uh two so oh what is this car hello hello is this wait wait wait wait wait is this with these new cars I can never tell um is this like uh cynical Senegal have this car now or would this be Nigeria uh I I don't nowadays I don't know the all the African cars which country has which ones so this is either Senegal or Nigeria um agree with these accents looks French kind of doesn't it so I'm kind of inclined to go more Senegal uh oh and we have a blue plate yes you in Senegal you do get blue plates yes yes you do so I think this should just be a Dakar then I think this should just be the car so yeah let's let's go with this this car we go to Dakar uh and it was nice very good very very good Good Start we have a yellow plate two yellow plates three yellow plates off the bat so this should be Colombia we have some mountains we have Mountain to kind of North East East North East Wood Bogota work Bogota has a mountain to the east but I mean if we would be here then it would have a mountain to North East as well and does the road angle align let's see Road angle is like that they're all dangle kind of a lines kind of a lines uh maybe not that steep maybe like this one or something could be something else as well of course work there are some hills the Northeast as well and the roads some of the roads might align as well yeah so it could be Medellin too let's go the mountain feels High ah okay it was neither one it was pastor was Pasto I don't even see that mountain here where is the mountain I guess there's this like kind of this mountain here there are some okay fair enough fair enough I don't know how I would have could have known the city there we have yellow back blades wet front plates this would be UK with these Road names as well coming from the ground feels uh kind of warm or like with palm trees and sunny and yeah I feel Southern to me it was gonna yeah England Southern England maybe uh maybe not necessarily Coastal something like Salisbury or something could be my guess yeah that's our Winchester let's go Winchester oh okay it actually was Coastal it was Portsmouth uh but yeah Winchester was a very close guess there so I'm very happy I think I'm guessing pretty okay today overall what is this now uh uh yeah black and white chevrons she can get in a couple of countries like Spain Italy Greece Albania I think those are the main ones uh generation four now do we have we do have yellow reflectors which is good because this would be Spain before seeing the yellow reflectors I was also thinking Spain because of yeah the Chevrons and the Seinfeld's kind of Spanish too so I think this is I'm quite certain this is Spain uh we can check that sun is to the South no surprise is there at all um generation four let's I don't know where in Spain though this doesn't feel like up here maybe a bit more South near cordobao or something there's appear to be some hills in this area as well this doesn't feel like Pyrenees to me like feels off so let's go let's go somewhere here ah it was North very Northwest near Portugal it felt kind of Portuguese so makes sense that it was near the border okay fair enough fair enough could have wished for a bit more points there but what can you do not least I get the country right which is nice so Italian plates Italian small front plates with blue on both sides you flung what mountainous how far north or south in Italy would this be sometimes struggle with determining that what does it say the the something with a t terrie or something what could it be trento would it be trento no it's not Trent off or four no it's not Toronto no it's not Toronto looking for people espresso started with t but it could be thronny no it's not troni tronto no it's not Toronto I don't know okay how far is south or north do I think this might be they have some mountains the architecture and everything I don't know feels maybe more Southern than Northern but not super Southern piano it wasn't tiano's no it wasn't oh my God it was Trieste oh God I it's actually a pretty decently sized city now that I see it but it's oh my God it's so hidden and I didn't know the city name before did it say did it say Trieste there could I have tell tr3 you can tell it's Trieste if I had known the city exists then I could have could have guessed it there for sure as you could tell it's Trieste or something similar okay but the score was better than uh in the first game when I feel my guess is weren't as good if that makes any sense uh but if you did play along let me know in the comments how you did and don't forget to press that like button as well on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy and huge thanks all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel if you would like

looking at the locations from above shall we so for this video let's use the map called World Series so we're gonna get cities all around the world um could be larger ones could be smaller ones I will see so let's have a 10 minute time limit um and satellite view is enabled and let's get going the links as always will be in the description if you want to play along if you don't know how to set up the satellite view um there will be a link in the toolbar um yeah in the info card this looks like a big city looks like a very big city from the get-go I was thinking what was I thinking I was thinking like kind of getting a bit of a London Vibe but I don't think it is I think the themes looks a bit different from above um maybe like could it be Paris what it no it wouldn't be okay let's zoom in let's have a closer look what do we see here it definitely feels like Europe from above uh we have some cars lots of cars driving the right side I'm sorry if you you're hearing any background noise there is a big thunderstorm outside so yeah hopefully you can't hear it so um there are different like sculptures all over the place but really hard to tell from above there is a big stadium with no writings so that doesn't help too much but I'm like I imagine this shouldn't be too difficult to find I I would imagine because it looks like a really big city with a pretty big river going through yeah the river goes a bit differently in Paris now what would it be though what would it be let's let's have a look at London with the other angle is different as I suspected uh could it be like Budapest or something I'm not sure I was thinking maybe also different River angle um let's go through some of the capitals I don't think it's Berlin yeah not gonna be Berlin we have like a bigger kind of um water reservoir here oh could this be Kiev maybe maybe another like a different multiple times around along the nip Nipper River no it's not Kiev also different angle um it's not going to be Warsaw yeah what else brog could it be Prague no maybe it is a French city just not Paris what about that okay different um different smaller French city this looks like such a cool place what is this this is like a playground I guess these are oh this looks like a really cool neighborhood some a bunch of apartment buildings with like green area uh like a playground some sports area this looks really really cool not sure what this is hmm maybe some concert hall or something um but yeah looks really cool but but but where are we that doesn't help too much with where we are I guess let's I'll have a look at some other French cities maybe maybe what what could it be nonce no the river is very flowy very flowy very [Music] um Wiggly I don't know very flowy very Wiggly it's not gonna be Brussels the river angle is different there as well yeah Antwerp no again no I am so lost I've looked at all the bigger cities I feel like I've looked at all of bigger cities in Europe but I thought this could be and it's none of them so I don't even know what what what this could be it looks like a really big city with so many cars so many Lanes running the right side of course I think he may be Poland but Poland I looked at Polish cities as well like nothing really fit could this ever be like Southern Swede and somewhere but the bigger cities are coastal this isn't Coastal I don't think this is this is nordics wait a minute is it or no I thought I God damn it I thought this was it like the river shape was kind of similar but no it's it's not it God damn it I thought I had it similar though but that doesn't help I think I'm gonna stick with bronze but could be Germany could be even Poland maybe you should go Germany because it's kind of in the middle for all four where I'm thinking that unfortunately I can't find anything that would fit perfectly I feel this is gonna be like something super obvious that I somehow overlooked I feel like I don't think I looked at like Romania or stuff could it be ever be here one of Romanian cities well it was Moscow I wasn't thinking Moscow yeah that's for sure interesting I mean it felt like a big city but didn't feel that big but I guess I was wrong okay fair enough not the best start but um okay fair enough it was still kind of Europe with Moscow still counts as Europe we just just yeah I wasn't thinking that let's hope my um future rounds are better looks like a very big city again definitely more arid looking my first thought is maybe like us or Mexico but um let's zoom in we have a river going through again which might help okay Shadows are going to the north which would indicate Northern Hemisphere and uh looks like we have yellow Road lines which would work with um Americas so oh we have only we have English so us sounds about right maybe it could be Canada during winter as well it looks like the trees trees have no leaves so it would be winter time so that would explain maybe why it's not as green maybe it's not arid maybe it's just winter so that's an option it looks like the trees are kinda kinda uh like white with snow okay so it might be Canada as well then potentially so either us or Canada no okay we have a baseball field in U.S and Canada I feel you can't look yeah okay New Mexico yeah I was about to say you can go to stadiums to look for texts because they often will have them uh Lobos is that a team name I've never heard of that in my life Lobos New Mexico Lobos well I this should be somewhere in New Mexico I imagine so New Mexico would be here is this Albuquerque maybe we do have a river going through Albuquerque which would would align I feel so we have this kind of curve yeah we do have a curve here so where is our uh pin pin is right around here ish let's try to pinpoint it now there is a Green Park here we are east of that green park somewhere here we have this uh circular like around about here and we go one two three four four and a half blocks from there one two three four four and a half blocks I think we should be there um I think so yeah I'm pretty sure here is that that kind of diagonal Street right here yeah I'm quite certain three meters let's go good good second round after that first first one uh I'm much more happy with the second one another big city okay I'm glad we're getting big cities because um I think this map contains some smaller cities as well so um I'm glad we are getting some bigger ones um for this purpose okay this appears to be like an airport the runway is a bit distorted it seems okay so we have a a stadium here or like a track or of some sorts this is feeling more European again to me now where though I don't think this is going to be Russia this time listen this one doesn't feel like Russia at all and um yeah like I feel like in Europe they don't put team names or city names on the stadiums as much it's still you can still find it but not as often as in the US or Canada okay so we're certainly driving on the right side yeah so what what would be the the like some landmarks some Clues here no Rivers this time which is unfortunate Rivers can definitely help a lot um well we have that airport but the airport looks quite small quite a small one like from the roofs my my thought was I don't know could be like Hungary maybe Serbia maybe somewhere in this area maybe not not very sure here might be more and more towards West as well I could see that too maybe like Germany another Airfield huh another Runway there north of the city okay I guess this isn't as small of an airport as I initially thought there are still a lot of airplanes just one Runway I think you you'd use this road to kind of get a go like ride all the way like this plane ride all the way here when you come here stay like wait here until the the air traffic control says you're good to go and then you take off from here I think that that's how it works I think um so yeah but but but yeah that doesn't help much uh determining where where we are but there are no good Clues really too there is this park in the middle of the city wait is this like some sort of like a royal wait this is like a castle huh okay this is a castle what kind of a castle could this be so there is a castle in the middle of the city I think that's the biggest clue the city is pretty big as well with like two airports one very small one kind of medium-sized deck I see you could say and no Rivers no Rivers um not gonna be Belgrade then Bucharest has a Rivera resolve I don't think so I'm thinking is thinking maybe Poland that that castle kind of gave me maybe polish Vibes or something like that maybe maybe Slovakia or something they say like in this area there's a river here though there is like a railroad terminal or or railroad whatever you call it um like like station here towards the east of the city so that could also be maybe helpful in figuring out which city that is maybe because those railroad um stations are easier to find on the maps usually chance the halva could it be [Music] I've been to Chance the hover but obviously I haven't seen it from above um but I don't think it aligns I don't think it aligns by the way if you want to see me geocaching enchants the hover I think I geocached in that City in the top top right video I'm pretty sure there was some geocaching going on there so go check it out if you're interested because like most German cities have a river placed somewhere nearby at least the bigger cities um or no maybe oh there is a castle here a green hmm would it align not really and there is a small River going through I I for a second I thought we might might have it ostrava no maybe I am very wrong with the area that's that's possible maybe it is more more Western than I am looking it's not but no but I think that's the closest that I can find yeah that we're running out of time so let's just go I don't know let's go Bruno but oh it was Italy I didn't check Italy Milano yeah if I had zoomed in on Milan I would have spotted it God damn it in hindsight Italy makes sense but yeah I was I was kinda focusing more on on this kind of central eastern Europe oh well oh well okay we have another River okay is this Europe it seems so is wait is this Vatican it is right this is Rome well Vatican and Rome I'm pretty sure this is the like Saint Peter's cathedral but Basilica pretty sure with this this these columns here and everything so let's just zoom in let's see now we have this uh what is that Castel santangelo Angelo that's the one and we would be but there is the roundabout that we see and we are right here I I think yes five meters very good and the last round of this game um looks more tricky we have mountains south of the city feels like Europe again mountains my first thought is Bulgaria Maybe that's what I am thinking they have mountains there but okay let's let's zoom in let's have a look we have some Red Roofs sun is the Shadows are to the north driving on the right side no surprises um stadiums have no writings we have some gray roofs we have some very bright rules we have some brownish roofs so quite different different types of rules some blue ones even yeah I think Bulgaria is is my initial guess on this one I think the roofs could fit as well along with the mountains so let's see any mountains to the north no it doesn't look like it okay so like a city with a mountain and uh no Rivers let's see if not Bulgaria maybe something like North Macedonia or something like that so Sofia has some mountains nearby but uh would it work does Sofia work there are mountains here but I feel Sophia might be bigger than this yeah I don't think it aligns at all this time it feels like we got a bit of a smaller City compared to the previous ones at least so that's a challenge additional challenge in itself could it be like scorpion no well maybe there are mountains directly south but I don't think it aligns either I can't find anything that works in this area with Montenegro maybe Albania Tirana but there are no Tirana doesn't work Tirana is bigger than this I feel as well Romania I didn't check Romania oh wait Brussels looks pretty good I think brasova lines very well we have this kind of kind of like a mountain going through in the city I think that is it this mountain aligns perfectly perfectly and yeah we have this um this this this uh Road this is gonna oh curvy Road here yum yeah this is it okay we found brassov or brushov I'm not sure how you say it properly but that's the city okay we are quite Central it seems white Central here at this Square City Square or Park City square of the Europe Council or something like that um so we would be here somewhere I think gonna be align the buildings maybe so there is this this long building or are those two those are two separate buildings I guess so we would be like here [Music] well either way I think it should be close enough or 5K okay yeah 11 meters that works very nice so how was our first game 18.9 000 overall pretty good um three 5Ks two not so 5Ks um but yeah let's play another game if you do play along let me know in the comments how you are doing and don't forget to press that like button and subscribe if you have not already that really helps out the channel thank you very much so what is this now hmm I'm thinking maybe Europe we're getting lots of European cities um I'm not sure if this map has mostly European cities or not but this feels like it might be Europe again we have shadows going to the north this time the roofs are quite kind of like gray bluish oh quite uh hilly it seems as well you can feel that 3D uh like like it feels 3D when you like look from above or to explain it but it feels um yeah feels 3D but that's cool um doesn't help much with well we know it's Healy so helps a little I guess we have a bunch of trains a train station um so did we have any rivers we have a bunch of Hills but I don't think we have any rivers do we I think those are all roads not Rivers yeah very Green Green Hills around the city Hmm this is very interesting I'm not sure what to think on this one it was very neat the city very nicely kept houses look nice clean um what's the name um like similar look nicely like themed nothing like pops out I'm not sure where where do they have roofs like this kind of like almost like a bluish tint in Europe so we have driving on the right side 30 kilometers an hour looks like it's such a nice neighborhood here very clean and nicely kept to where I was thinking like maybe southern would this ever be sweet and then I don't know I was thinking nordics maybe I think maybe Belgian the rules are confusing me I don't know oh we have this and a bike Lanes very nice Spike lines like that over the roads good good bike infrastructure it seems so maybe the Netherlands even could that be it or Belgium is still an option but but this is mountainous these are hillies this is a hilly City uh if it is like like Belgium then it would be kind of South here then but I don't think it can be the Netherlands I don't think it gets that hilly anywhere here but with Belgium you can't see some hilly Belgium towards the South but but I don't know if it looks like this from above could this ever be Norway Maybe but in Norway there's a lot of water everywhere that's the only on my only concern there is we have we have mountains we have Hills but no water really I'm so confused on this one Austria could this be Austria Slovakia I don't know I feel like the roofs would be different in like Slovakia and Austria hmm Germany could it be now this isn't too big of a city so it would be really really tricky to find it without knowing the country so I feel like we'll need to kind of hedge our bets is there is there a river going there through there or no no that's that's not our River no like it almost looks like there is a river flowing through but it's just a road I'm wherever this is this looks like a very nicely kept uh City would like solar panel roofs and nice bike in for a structure a big parking lot here wait what the what is this parking lot for I guess for the neighborhood I don't know the big parking lot in the middle of the city okay well we do have a near airport as well but it well we have a couple of planes here but I'm feeling Germany would be my best guess like Germany Austria Slovenia somewhere this area maybe Italy yeah I I I don't know let's go somewhere somewhere here let's go yeah um here let's see what was it Luxembourg it was Luxembourg huh wait there was a river I didn't see it I was looking all over the place I couldn't see a river there well that would have helped if I saw that River okay oh it looked so nice from above really nice oh okay makes sense why it felt so similar to kind of Belgium and the Netherlands because it's right there aha well I was I was checking out the southern Belgium but I didn't think of Luxembourg okay well what can you do um so okay this is a big big big city uh my first thought was us but uh could this be Europe maybe I'm not sure let's see like these kind of like uh grid grid roads feel more American than European in Europe the roads are usually are all over the place this kind of grid structure structure feels more American to me we have a baseball field here as well which is definitely more American Calgary Calgary well that helps Hungary where is calgaros here yes I even remembered well where Calgary was kind of impressive so um so is this Calgary does it align it does align here is that Lake here very nice and we would be somewhere south of downtown commercial or maybe yeah Calgary Design District artsy part of Calgary okay no now we gotta find so we have this River here we have um this road so we're somewhere along here somewhere along here so we have this uh Central Memorial Park here we have this whole thing Park I mean I think we're here then right yeah I think so and we have this long long building to our East this long one polo Terrace condos that's the one so yeah we go like here okay 50 meters still 5K let's go very nice and after that round we get it's definitely something that looks more difficult [Music] um yeah this looks small it's more smaller doesn't look European at all you can't have Europe on North America all the time right now would this be Brazil or something where what is this let's see we're driving on which side looks like we might be wait which set are we driving on I can't tell um it looks like yeah we're driving on the left side here we're drawing the left side okay the Shadows are going to the South so we would be in southern hemisphere I was thinking maybe South Africa so with the shadows and driving side it would work it would work with kind of South Africa I think ah but how would we ever find this in South Africa we have some mountains here could this ever be less suit no this wouldn't be Lesotho no because in lesudu we would uh see this border mazero you could this border is very visible from above what would this be though this doesn't look like huge it still looks like a decently sized city but wouldn't be like Pretoria or Johannesburg or anything like that I feel there is a stadium which well there is no text either way doesn't load but doesn't matter this wouldn't this wouldn't be Australia would it not I don't think so it feels more South African to me well this is an interesting building complex looks very out of place compared to other um other buildings very turquoise and very noticeable from way above we have a look again railroad station right in the middle of the city this this wouldn't be Botswana would it I don't think so gaborone wouldn't work um could this be Newcastle I don't think there is much point of me trying to find this in South Africa because like there are so many towns that it could be and there I don't see any like unique features that would like Give It Away immediately I guess it's not not easy to tell is is that the city is it not that City so yeah I feel like I might as well just plonk it in one of these cities and hope that it it might be nearby I don't have water though no wait oh no but we do have a small River here you know we do kariga let's let's go carica maybe maybe here Pete Peter maritzburg because it says it has Peter how would you pronounce this because it's spelled differently it's not like Peter it's pieter pietermaritzburg I don't know well it's not it but I don't have a better guess okay it was one of the cities in South Africa um yeah yeah I mean now that we zoom in yeah it Alliance but finding it too too difficult I feel at least for me okay okay we have um mountains we have water first thought is Norway because they have mountains and they have water and uh yeah and these islands are connected with roads this feels very Norwegian to me from the first glance let's zoom in let's see um what do we find definitely feels European definitely feels Norwegian to me so very green very nice looking we have a stadium with no texts again yeah I've I feel like this is Norway we just gotta start finding where now that might be problem finding where in Norway because um I mean have you seen the coast of Norway it all looks like this so that that might be the biggest challenge here finding where this would be so we're somewhere somewhere on the West Coast somewhere on the west coast we have roads we have smaller towns all over the place well it doesn't doesn't look like we have one big city but bunch of smaller ones that's how it looks from from above at least a bunch of smaller cities interconnected with each other hmm oh my God it's so loud outside with a thunderstorm I wonder if you can hear it or not no this wouldn't be bad again with it wait it actually is wait it actually is what the hell I thought I would spend like five minutes looking for it but that's the literally literally the first thing I zoom in on okay it's Bergen then it aligns perfectly with this this this kind of Pier or or I don't know how to call it but yeah that's definitely it although it was normal I know surprise is there we have this house here I think we would be like right in the middle somewhere somewhere here ish I don't want to lose like one point because I'm not precise enough that would be annoying but I feel like this is as close as I can get pretty much okay this is good four meters that definitely works very good and for the last round nothing too difficult please okay we looks like a big city looks like um well a big river and I was thinking is this North America is this Europe the feels more European from above because I don't see any like Big Grid patterns those the streets are are more kind of all over the place here a big Stadium again oh a smaller Stadium but oh 1927 or something um is that Cyrillic Kiev Kiev Ukraine it is definitely oh it makes sense yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah uh like or earlier in this video I zoomed in on Kiev and it looked exactly like this yeah yeah yeah so we are right on the bridge uh this bridge here yes a lion's perfectly um we have this kind of kind of U-turn thingy where is it this one right yeah it's right here then very well very well eight meters well we did better than in the first uh first game if you played along let me know in the comments if you managed to beat me and on the right side there will be another play along satellite view video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of my patrons and YouTube members who are

World roller coasters and amusement parks I like roller coasters and amusement parks personally no it's not for everyone but I like them uh but uh so let's play No moving let's say two minutes per round to have a bit more time links is always in the description you can play along uh but make sure to do it before watching this video so don't spoil anything wait I gotta set up sound here we go sound should be fine now um innocuo well this is Japan isn't it um we are driving on the left side yeah this is low camera um now will I find something that is helpful to me I know you can use these um metal thingies like plates on the poles you can use these to kind of figure out the which municipality in Japan it is I don't know them I don't know them ah they are too tricky for me too much for me to learn but if you do know them they can be super helpful for sure um this looks like a cool Amusement party though to be fair are these these kind of fake cacti a nice extra um I I I um I like these ones I've been to London Eye two times I think it's nice to see the London from above um yeah I don't think I'm gonna no find out anything else from here because yeah let's just guess Japan I guess we have water here I feel do we it feels like we are near Water to me just just by the vibe so I don't know let's go somewhere here near Nagoya Maybe here we go uh wasn't really that near water I'm out there was a river nearby so yeah just just Falls like near water to me another Ferris wheel I think that's what they are called This is a bigger one wait is this on top of a building a ferris wheel on top of a building sounds really unsafe sounds unsafe to me but okay um yeah all right so what what do we have we have um is that Chinese I think uh so would this be Taiwan we're driving the right side so wouldn't be Hong Kong it's because of that or it wouldn't be mainland China that's for sure as well with a coverage like this so I think this has to be Taiwan now where though um I know you can sometimes use phone numbers in Taiwan but uh we don't have the area code on this one so that's not helpful if you can read Chinese maybe this sounds help but not to me so I think we just got a Vibe guess again because I I'm not seeing any helpful Clues here I don't think it's gonna be like human County I don't think so well I hope it isn't because but uh it doesn't we don't see any mountains around uh do we so I'm thinking it might be kind of Western Taiwan because it's more flatter there maybe it's somewhere more North but I don't know I'm gonna go Taichung City somewhere here just because of the flatness ah was more South I mean yeah it is flat there as well call call soon City that's what it was all right what is this now uh something Cyrillic Park something okay well we have Cyrillic we have plates with no blue strips no strips at all it seems so I would go Russia yeah we have Russian here no oh this looks like a very sketchy amusement park I would not feel safe um going here I think it says American um what do you call them in English uh American uh what do you call them oh my God I'm blanking I can't think of the English word what do those American things where you go with with cards down downhill I I I'm sure I'll remember the name in a bit oh I don't see any good phone numbers um where we had one somewhere 900s 900s I think 900s were mobile phones and they were useless in terms of figuring out where you are sometimes you can use these these codes to kind of figure out the area in Russia that's one of the good methods to kind of tell where you are but not by this phone number I don't think yeah and I don't know if you see any any good clues that could help with um figuring out the area of Russia let me know in the comments but I don't know I'm I'm guessing maybe Crosstour could something there no clue really just just guessing Vibe guessing my vibes were off my wives are off this was Samara well I guess it was roller coaster was the world word roller coaster how could I not think of roller coaster so we have some more roller coasters here Universal land and Entre Entre well this feels very much like France zero five okay zero five uh in France the area codes go like one is Paris two is Northwest three is northeast or is southeast five is Southwest so like around this part now do we see the city name I don't think so well if we do then I can't read it properly gauch is in the city is it long side I don't know maybe one of these words is a city name but I don't know which one then I know the area of France we should be in the park itself we can have a quick look at this looks this looks fun I've been to Disneyland in France but my favorite ride is in Finland actually I don't remember the name of the theme park but there is this ride where you kind of get strapped on you and your legs are hanging loose and then you get swished around I think the ride was called Tornado or something that was a fun one uh but but yeah I haven't been to the theme park in a while uh anyways would be fun to go actually at some point maybe I could make a video out of it who knows cause Okay cough cause that helps right Caucasus is that how you say it in English I don't know I'm probably butchering it we have a Russian flag and we have some other local Flags here probably like the region Flags I don't know those but uh it should be somewhere here in kafka's does it say The city or apartment me something something of this Supermarket well again I feel like I know the area but more than that I don't see any Moria Mora is C isn't it so maybe in somewhere near the sea Novo Rosie or something maybe I don't know more it doesn't feel super Coastal though man maybe that's it doesn't feel really Coastal to me though I don't know I don't know maybe it's just like krasnodar maybe not not exactly on the sea but close enough to to advertise C maybe it was on the sea okay I guess it just didn't feel super close to laughter sees could have been a bit closer but still I'm pretty happy with my guesses 18.8 thousand we had some easy around some more tricky ones but overall I'm pretty happy uh let's go for another game shall we again the link in the description same settings as before let's see can I beat the 18.8 000 score or not and of course if you play along let me know in the comments about your scores and don't forget and don't forget to press that like button and subscribe for more geographer and other videos in the future for sure so uh what is it what do you have lost serpientes that sounds Spanish to me I would say oh this is a very interesting antenna oh not sure what to think about it's Mexico maybe I think I've seen some interesting antennas in Mexico before but that's definitely not conclusive but something Thriller almost like a theme park for kids because this slide wouldn't handle me that slide would not handle me well uh toilet toilet on the playground it's like part of some sort of zoo doesn't it it's like we have some animals being advertised and I'm just kidding I'm getting a zoo Vibe but that doesn't really help much that that we know that this is the zoo they have zoos everywhere um the sun well this is Gen 2 this is Gen 2 so something to keep in mind Sun seems to be maybe to the South a little bit so I think Mexico is is as good of a guess as any with Gen 2 Spanish sun to the South yeah Mexico I would say is definitely my best guess no idea where uh judging by the trees may be kind of a bit north of Mexico City but I'm not very confident let's go Leon something there and it was just Mexico City fair enough uh the zoo zoo of Mexico City okay I'm happy I got the country right not too far away if I would have just Capital guessed then would have been excellent but still good okay now this feels like the US of a oh some big big roller coasters oh and this looks like a fun is this that that ship that swings back and a fourth I've never been to one but I've seen there are like those those rides where you swing from back and forth I imagine that could be quite fun Breeze plates I don't know what that is take out yeah we have American flags I'm not sure what those flags are maybe State ones but maybe not how do we figure out where in the US we are oh we have a one yellow plate yellow front plate and judging by the color of it and the general Vibes of it we might be crossing under north um West Northeastern America those because those are New York plates these kind of dark yellow ones and there's another one I saw um where did I see it I saw another yellow one here was this the one I saw that I guess that is kind of yellow I guess so that that was the one I thought I saw so we have two yellow plates the other ones are white so I don't think we are in the New York state in like exactly but there seems to be water to the north water to the north New York plates all around well maybe not all around but nearby so I'm thinking we might be kind of like here ish like in what is this Ohio wait Ohio did have front plates and all the other states around it didn't I think something like that oh God I should really refresh my knowledge oh it was just New York State huh or it was just New York state only only two New York plates that I saw though huh well fair enough we did have water to the north that checks out just I guessed more kinda away from there because because of the plates yeah I really remember correctly Ohio requires front and back plate so that was right and New York also does next round three well we're driving on the left side what do we have we have uh well we have yellow back plates which would indicate the UK boards sailing area or sailing ferry boat in well obviously we're somewhere Coastal where is the uh is this this is the theme park a pretty small one fun land sea view that is sea view Sea View isn't the place right name like the city name Sea View I'm sure that that this sign says the city name but I can't really read it something penalty is 500 pounds so be careful don't get penalized for something I don't know which city this is like I can't find any names we have some kind of palm trees some warmer looking um plants so maybe a bit more towards South in the southern coast of the UK that's kind of my reasoning there that's all I have to go on here I feel unless I suddenly find Sea View somewhere but I doubt that that's the city name yeah let's just get somewhere here okay okay it was Portsmouth after Allah I think we saw Portsmouth this it's saying Portsmouth anywhere I'll admit I did get quite lucky but there was some reasoning behind the guess so kinda lucky but with some some knowledge Premiere in so where is the theme park this is the theme park on a coast again again Coastal we have English we have driving the left side again so this is UK again and the the water is to our South so would this be southern coast again we have some wind turbines uh in the water there grand tourer grand tourer if Premiere in this wouldn't be Portsmouth again right what does it say concrete what what cities does it say something with a c and an L I feel fish chips C and L that's that's a stretch isn't it CNL Canterbury no Chichester I like the name Chichester I thought that this is gonna be another Portsmouth maybe something like uh burn mouth burn the mouth that is that how you sell it say it burn mouth bore born mouth a weird name do we see the what is it Premiere in on the coast somewhere maybe born with Peach we don't have too much time we have seven seconds so might as well guess somewhere here I don't know yeah yeah yeah it water was to our South collecting on sea and there's the premiere in uh oh well well we got the country right which wasn't too difficult we have a double decker bus this is not UK though since we're driving on the right side um this pedestrian Crossing Sun not entirely sure is beef France I don't know wait let's let's have a look around Technica Museum Tera Technica what is this Freeport fashion outlet Freeport wait what report we have like a mini driveway with European signs all like this is definitely Europe we have a yellow line which is okay um Freeport if English video games pinballs I'm sure we are driving on the right side and we have English and this maybe it's English because it's touristy would be my best guess if we're driving the right side it's not it's not UK it's not Ireland what is it with English like this sign I am very much not sure it reminds me kind of of Norwegian sign could this be Norway by any chance ever I have no idea to be honest the English language is throwing me off so hard there I would have gone maybe France otherwise if it wasn't for this I might be very much tripping with my pedestrian signs it was what was it Jackie huh yeah I was so awful I was so wrong here such a confusing it felt kind of coastal as well to me which I would have never guessed there that's for sure I check you didn't even come to my mind well if you got that one correctly well props to you because that one threw meth I did beat my score of the first game though because we didn't have any Russian rounds this time but yeah uh let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel if you would like to become one and get access to some exclusive videos check the links in the description I hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind

moving if it's an MP said well yeah so let's get going the links will be in the description um yeah so you can try that oh God I'm gonna be so bad at it I haven't done an MP set for I don't know how many months so this is gonna be a rough let me tell you um at first I was thinking Europe but the more I look at it the more I'm getting kind of Asian Vibes so I'm starting to think maybe Korea how does Korea sound to you huh like South Korea of course not not the north one North Korea doesn't have official coverage fun fact uh I don't know I'm getting kind of South Korea Vibes I might be super wrong could this be Japan this this doesn't feel like a low cam to me so let's go let's go South Korea maybe let's see I'll take it it was DeJean I should have probably gone for a city not just plunk it in the middle of nowhere but I'll take it let's go I don't know like maybe architecture gave it away or something just Vibes you know I'm just just going by The Vibes at this point we have bollards here we have bollards these bollards with the little sidey side thing to the side and this style of bollards with black reflector in general those are Austrian bollards so it would be in Austria I believe and um yeah let's there are some hills I don't see it's a huge mountain so let's just guess kind of maybe Central Area somewhere here okay not bad not bad 4800 very nice okay what is it I know it doesn't say China I genuinely cannot read but it says China nothing China um but what is it is it like turkey maybe or no no it's not turkey wait um the the the sign design kind of giving me Portugal Vibes actually could this be Portugal or maybe Spain are the reflectors yellow or not I can't really tell there may be dark yellow they might be called orangey you know this this maybe maybe it is Spain it's either Portugal or Spain I'm kind of torn between the two let's go with um let's go with Portugal near Spain I'm Spain God damn it oh very red soil very red soil Sun appears to be hard to tell the directions kind of looks like it's in the middle to the east maybe slightly to the north but I'm not sure so with this red soil the trees feel weird to me I'm thinking Brazil but I'm not sure what's what's with the trees trees don't feel particularly Brazilian but I don't know what I mean us again sometimes have dark soil like this in some areas could this be ever us like Oklahoma or something I think Oklahoma had some red soil I like Oklahoma better than Brazil with these trees because because they do not look Brazilian I might be super wrong of course I always can be super wrong but um because I'm not super confident about the direction of the Sun and let's let's go us maybe okay nice okay it wasn't Dr Hallman it was Mississippi but I am super happy with my guess here just and the fifth round oh can we get 20 20K at least in total that would be cool well this feels like Europe for sure they don't see any like big clothes there is like a pylon in the distance yeah you can see it um what that doesn't help we have your heels Gen 4 um I was thinking France because this feels like a typical French landscape it could be like Austria or something as well I'm not sure the Germany had the new coverage recently um you might have heard Germany got uh coverage everywhere almost well the whole country instead of just the biggest cities Now and Google good quality coverage as well I'm not sure if small roads like this are covered in Germany but if they are maybe this could be the new Germany coverage who knows but I would my main guess would be France but since I'm considering maybe Austria then let's go kind of Eastern France somewhere here ah it was was it Austria it was Austria a sneaky Austria we did not get to 20K close though very close but no cigar well let's play another one let's play another game uh link of course in the the description of course as always oh oh gosh this is Russia isn't it or could this be Ukraine Maybe Russia or Ukraine maybe more I'm learning more towards Ukraine actually maybe very flat the road quality isn't the best you know these concrete block roads does Ukraine get them I'm not sure maybe it is Russia then uh the ball as you get is you can get these bollards in either country yeah um I'm I don't know let's just eat kind of more eastern Ukraine somewhere here could easily be Russia as well uh it was yeah it was Ukraine very close to Russia but yeah pretty much good read by me oh this would be Uruguay with some tanks okay hello uh okay maybe some training or something I'm not sure what's happening here but these Road lines these Road lines yellow yellow uh double yellow land with white in the middle you see that in Uruguay and we also see this Bollard here which uh looks like it could be Uruguayan as well the landscape definitely can see this being Uruguay too so yeah I'm fairly confident pretty pretty confident so yeah let's just guess somewhere here maybe let's see wrong side of the country but luckily it's not too big of a country so okay now would wait do we have is there water there towards our uh uh wet Northwest one thing that I noticed is that I think this pole might have those black and dark yellow or orange stripes going all the way to the ground it seems which would make me think Taiwan because of that because that one Taiwanese poles often have those stripes on them we have mountains we have water so I mean Taiwan sounds like a good option to me it wasn't for the pole I would maybe think the Philippines but um I think I'm gonna go with the pole here I think I'm gonna go with the pole so let's go yeah kind of kinda and we have water to the north west huh the worst Western were here maybe maybe somewhere let's see in the niche well Indonesia we would have been my third guess but what's with that pole can we see closer that Paul threw me off well that it was not a stride people I guess those leaves looked like stripes or something from this angle those were leaves oh my God this look like like orange stripes to me oh my God I get so baited by those leaves rip not not a good round for me um okay what is this now um is that a flag there oh you probably are you can't see it behind my head that's a flag there but is there a French flag could this ever be France what I wasn't thinking France okay I'll put my face back I wasn't hmm mate I mean maybe it could be I was thinking like Italy wait could it be Italian maybe it's green not blue I can't really see look looked blue at first but hard to hard to see um I mean maybe maybe it is France maybe it is I mean France can be mountainous for sure um maybe somewhere near Italy or somewhere here in the Alps that would be my guess I think let's see it was okay it was Italy after all I guess it was Italian flag but super close to the border so I'm pretty much right with the with the area which I'm happy about now oh this is giving me big um either Peru or Chile or Bolivia vibes basically this area giving me big big this area vibe not sure does this area have a certain name another like there is Lake Titicaca maybe it's called the titikaka area I'm not sure but yeah The Vibes are getting me those vibes but which country is this I'm not sure do we see any electricity counters I don't think we do from this angle some hills some mountains here very dry very very dry I think Chile and area here isn't that easy I don't think Sheila gets more mountainous when it comes like going more south so maybe kind of Peru you get some mountains here maybe but let's let's try Peru I think let's see ah it was Bull Levy okay it was more East than I thought um okay fair enough okay well how did the results go not not terrible but not great that Taiwan round if I had to guest a little bit closer maybe maybe Philippines would have been enough for 20K but again let's go for another one let's go for one more how long have I been recording yeah we can we have time for one more game I think so let's let's go for one oh no no not single player challenge so you can play along Link in the description of course bad start bad start we have uh basketball hoop but uh the big thing here is that I think this is us or Canada definitely not Europe we have um this green street sign we have small plates we have these like Transformers or whatever you call them I always forget on the polls this is us or Canada uh we have a boat that doesn't help too much there is water nearby well in a lot of places I am thinking maybe it is like near the Great Lakes maybe maybe not maybe not um for some reason and I was thinking maybe more Canada but I don't know no no idea let's go maybe somewhere like here I can't say this see the stop sign if it says array or stop and I cannot read the stop sign at all so let's go somewhere here I'm thinking maybe it could be like Nova Scotia even or maybe some kind of got a hedging between the great lakes and a Nova sculptures there not a great start of the game it was the opposite said I don't know the mountains didn't really feel like BC to me that much if the thought came to my head but I kind of dismissed it this time unfortunately this is gonna be a rough game it seems well we have some palm trees quite a dry location are we driving on the right side here it seems are we like Botswana came to mind for a second but Botswana drives on the left side as you probably know I'll let you don't know what this is what is this what is this I wish I could start a new game because these two first two rounds are just terrible what the hell um could this be like ever like Brazil Northern Northeast Brazil or Northern Colombia I don't know I know like Northeast Brazil and Northern Colombia can get kind of dry and I don't know where that fits though but I don't think I have a better guess if we're driving on the right side if we were drawing left I would have gone like with Botswana South Africa maybe but I'm not super happy with my guess at all but let's see Pentagon hmm wasn't getting Senegal I was again Senegal popped into my head and I dismissed it maybe I should stop this missing my thoughts maybe maybe I should wherever it's Norway is this Norway getting big Norwegian wives or right off the bat here we have some long yellow lines um with some water beautiful landscapes very beautiful Norway is a such a beautiful country I have to say yeah I think I think Norway would be my best guess here judging by the a landscape by the trees oh I I often misjudge things in Norway though but let's get somewhere here maybe getting a bit too north but let's let's see I was guessing a bit too North yeah oh well no okay now is this South Africa we have these triple white lines in the middle uh just we have generation two camera judging by the circle blur and just the landscape would fit with South Africa I would say so yeah let's go where though South Africa is a big country we're getting some some tricky rounds in this Siege because either either I have no idea where it is or the country is Big so uh I guess the wrong side now let's go not sure not sure at all let's go could this be near ish Cape Town with mountains like this well let's risk it and see okay that's a great guess what the hell I'll take that I needed that hmm okay only 40 kilometers away let's go uh and last but certainly not least sun is to the north we have a black car now this would be Argentina or Uruguay I would say I would say maybe leaning more towards Argentina here but I could easily see this being Uruguay too so I'm not very confident there so I'm thinking maybe guessing Argentina near Uruguay somewhere this area and if it is Uruguay then then we don't lose too many points that's kind of my thinking here let's see it was Uruguay after all okay so we not bad not bad total uh like my weakest game feel like it was definitely the toughest seed as well we've got Canada around the Senegal round the other three guesses maybe Norway I could have wished for a little bit closer one all in all I think I did well let me know how you did in the comments below and press that like video And subscribe if you enjoyed it and on the right

"https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/w1KVR6ca7iROOZr5"], "transcript": "hello and welcome back to another geographer play a long video and in this one we're gonna play a map called strangest official coverage I think we've played it once before a long time ago but there are plenty of more locations here so I thought let's play it again why not I'm in the mood for some weird coverage today the play along links as always will be in the description if you want to play along and the time limit let's set it to two minutes per round and no moving let's see good luck to everyone good luck to yawn okay so yeah all of this is official coverage as as the name of the map States okay so where's the sun first of all the sun is to the South well yeah my first thought was like holstery or something but I'm thinking could this be us potentially us or or maybe Canada I don't know but uh I don't know if this is Europe or America somewhere any clues that we can notice maybe the house the architecture I don't know I could see like in in I could imagine seeing it in either uh continent to be honest no text visible everything's been blurred we have an ax the more I'm thinking about it the more I think this probably would be America I think but I don't know really uh yeah yeah yeah where would this be mountains like these let's go like would this be like Montana Washington still it might be somewhere here this area with mountains and and lakes and everything let's go okay not bad it was Canada after all but I'm very happy that uh I went there I don't know the mountains felt more American um and uh I thought it looked like a weird coverage like that would be more likely to be in America oh some ruins this time we have some ruins I've seen ruins in so many countries in Google coverage like Tunisia Jordan Greece turkey would this be anything of that or would this be something completely else where's the sun the sun is basically in the middle basically maybe a little bit to the South maybe hard to see very deserty very dry so maybe maybe Jordan my main contestants main options would be a Jordan or Tunisia here I would say um Jordan or Tunisia do we see any water in the distance it's so foggy and unsmoggy that uh I don't think we do I don't think this would be UAE I don't think so uh I think I think let's go Jordan let's go Jordan there are some hills here we do have some hills here as well maybe this is somewhere near Petra or something I don't know let's let's see I was Tunisia ah my other option where was it well that doesn't say much apparently it's a ruined fortified XR located in the Tatooine governorate in southern Tunisia okay fair enough um looked like interesting ruins but quite far away from from cities so probably hard to visit um so this is really my first thought was like um Asia that was my first thought something like Indonesia or or Thailand um we have these kind of kind of leafy roofs not not too much information in these places so you've got a base your guesses mostly on landscapes and maybe architecture if you see anything there are some boats some boats here um my first thought was Asia but I could see this being something like um somewhere in Latin America as well maybe where is the sun always gotta remember to check the sun the sun is to the South so it doesn't eliminate either one I think Hmm uh I'm torn I'm torn which one should I choose I don't know this boat doesn't feel very Asian to me but but I'm sure they use these types of boats there as well whenever I've seen some some documentaries or something I feel like their boats look a bit different but I don't know maybe that's a ridiculous reasoning um there's someone swimming here I don't see how they look at all someone is chilling here but those might as well be tourists so I don't know could this be like Guatemala or something I don't know let's let's go Guatemala it was are you kidding me oh my God very close to Mexican border I didn't even know there was a coverage up here what Hotel Laguna La Chua okay it's some sort of like a hotel this is this looks like a really nice place to like um go on a vacation I imagine you just rent out the whole uh hotel and like the whole whole leak is for you that would be dope okay round number four round number four ah here my first thought was Scotland or something with these Hills and then this the overall Vibe uh like yeah feeling UK the Sun is kind of North what it is very low though it is very very low um so whenever the sun is low it's not as reliable so yeah gotta remember that we have some houses which we can't really see properly and of course the big thing here is the abandoned ship we have an abandoned ship here the architecture I don't know maybe maybe you could find something like that in Scotland or something maybe I guess why not if you are playing along though let me know in the comments what are your scores I'm really interested too hear how you are doing in these locations because these aren't these are tricky ones for sure these are quite tricky and I really want to go Scotland or something feels like United Kingdom to me I don't know I might be very wrong but uh we have these this water kind of to the South maybe somewhere here here I don't know let let's see well that's why the sun was to the north should have trusted it where was it oh Mike I would have never guessed there what the hell New Island what a great what a great name for the island the new island is this called the old Island probably not uh no but okay so it is Barnard's Memorial Museum okay who is Barnard this Museum incorporates the remains of a rough stolen Hut built by Captain Barnard marooned here after an encounter with a crew of a Shipwrecked British vessel in 1813. I guess that was the uh the ship that we saw there interesting that little hot was that museum okay it's cool to to read the stories about these these locations when we can find some info oh gosh oh gosh what is this now very snowy uh mountainy you don't see such a snowy coverage much in street view the sun is to the South yeah but um my first thought was U.S or Canada here with mountains with these snowy roads I don't think you would get such a snowy coverage like this in Europe I don't think I feel like I would know it maybe maybe not um I guess we'll see soon enough but I would guess I somewhere in U.S or Canada there are lots of mountains all over the US and Canada though so which which part of the us or Canada would this be I don't know let's go some maybe something like British Columbia again British Columbia maybe it's somewhere Northern us maybe it's somewhere else but I think this is my best guess it was on Dora huh wow oh no it was Spain oh my God it was Spain right next to Andorra wow I had not seen that coverage before that's interesting that's interesting oh my God we had two good guesses the other ones not so much very happy with the um with the Guatemala guest that was that was a crazy one so I'll take that and let's do another game let's do another game same map same settings uh link of course again in the description what is this are you kidding me why is there a coverage in the middle of jungle um okay very very warm looking very tropical I have my first thought here was that um there is a coverage walking down a jungle path I've seen in Uganda I think in the Eastern Uganda was it I don't know if this is the one though I just remember seeing like a jungle coverage there maybe you know that there is like a guy following with an AK rifle that that's the that's the coverage that I'm thinking I don't know if this is the one though this might be something completely different yeah there's nothing else I'm gonna find here the sun can't really tell which direction may be to the South a little bit which would work with Uganda no let's go let's go there I don't know uh the opposite side of the world where was it it was Cocos Island National Park Costa Rica I'll be honest I had no idea there is coverage there no idea um interesting that they are also called cocoa it's called the Coco silent because there are caucus Islands here I knew about these ones but yeah that's a surprise that there is coverage here learning something new learning something new which is good to learn oh okay we have Islands oh no oh no this could be anywhere Google has covered so many random small islands that uh yeah this is very flat a lot of it will probably be soon be underwater unfortunately just gotta choose something I guess my first thought was that this feels like Maldives but the Maldives doesn't have uh official coverage so the next best thing that comes to mind is British Indian Ocean territory because it's close to Maldives so I imagine it looks probably similar and it does have coverage I don't know if this is it though no idea but so I think that's my best guess here so let's see let's go let's go I'll take it with some tiny tiny Islands uh a bit more North but I'm very happy with this guess great start uh start yes oh this is Petra this is Petro this is uh where's this strange I don't know I mean I guess it might look strange like a big building in uh carved into a uh stone wall but it is Petra I would love to visit it so it is in Jordan I didn't mention it earlier this video as well so now where was it can I find it now oh here we go here Petra is here was this the treasury though or was this the Great temple no it wasn't the Ancient Temple card into sandstone yes the treasury I think this might have been the treasury I think yes it was okay and a perfect score let's go oh okay I'm happy about that oh okay Asian style architecture right right away right away I'm thinking what am I thinking Japan South Coast dwarf military tunnel North Coast North Coast dwarf what is this the language looks Chinese not Japanese to me so where would this be could this ever be like one of these islands of Hong Kong maybe I don't know do they have coverage um maybe some other small islands along the coast which I don't think have coverage but I don't you never know there's plenty of coverage that I'm not aware of um but I think these mountains look like similar to the ones that you have in Hong Kong they have Chinese we have some English for tourists as well yeah I think that's my best guess to get somewhere could this be Taiwan somewhere hmm maybe but I don't know but if it is Taiwan it's not too far from Hong Kong I guess let's see how it was Taiwan it was Taiwan okay it was a small island it was this small island I didn't even know this island existed to be honest 401 Highland what is that so that's the Island's highest peak but the island is actually 398 meters high but the observation deck is three meters tall so it's known as 401 Highland fun fact all right and the last oh God the last location well this is official coverage indeed I have seen under a water coverage like this in a couple of places I can't remember if it all all of that was official or not um I've seen some in Caribbean I've seen some in Great Barrier Reef so I think it might be somewhere here maybe on the coast of Australia this is just just uh Gotta Get Lucky let's see if it is here or not okay this was not there this was on the coast of Malaysia yeah I think I've seen that coverage before as well yeah just gotta get lucky uh a little bit better than the first game I think I'm very happy with the British Indian Ocean territory guess and of course the 5K and yeah let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope y'all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/w0McH43qlx2OnVlS", "data/images_geopeter/w1KVR6ca7iROOZr5"], "locations":

"hello and welcome back to another geoguessor video and in this one you've been asking for it for a while so let's do some more satellite view uh games well probably one in this video if you want to play it along you will need a Unity script installed I'll leave the video on how to do it in the info card somewhere there and yeah let's get going I haven't played satellite view for a very long time round time let's say I think I usually did 10 minutes right and satellite yes no live weather no 3D and let's get going good luck to us oh it kind of Flushed there for a second but it didn't really see much looked European I can tell that much but um let's zoom out I mean the landscape does look very European like with these fields in general so um that the little flash didn't give too much away I don't think at least they didn't know this much but let's zoom in let's have a look at some of these details what do we have we have a stadium with without any texts these houses with kind of Red Roofs gray roofs giving me maybe central European Vibes maybe more towards Western Europe central western Europe or something we have a river doesn't seem like a very big river it doesn't seem like a very big city well since we're playing the map this we know that this city is at least 100 000 population so it's not a very small city either but um at least from above doesn't look that huge hmm so surely we're driving on the right sides yes we are it seems and um the Sun is going the Shadows are going to the north so we are in the northern hemisphere just confirming Europe so it is Europe I'm sure of that I'm not sure about the girl of the country though at all I'm just I'm not sure I remember how difficult this was now this is this is a tricky one we have another stadium and again without any texts in American stadiums they often have some texts in Europe sometimes but not as often not as often I don't know I don't know like Slovenia could this be Slovenia looks kind of flat maybe too flat for Slovenia um I don't know the river could this be muddy board no the river doesn't align does it I guess we can have a look scan for a river like this uh somewhere I wish I knew which country this was though satellite view videos are a lot of scanning without you knowing which country it is which is definitely a different challenge than the regular Geo guesser I don't know maybe more Western I haven't been able to find anything here if it was more Western what could it be Germany Belgium France I don't know Switzerland Maybe get a northern part where it's not as hilly there is a river here it doesn't really align I don't think blend maybe it must be Poland or czechia I didn't check here before or maybe something like Romania Bulgaria um whistle line we have this this this aisle and I think it aligns actually yeah is is there a small there is a smaller okay found it it was Poland it was actually Poland okay good we found it uh good so uh not pinpointing the fun part so we have these big roads with this big intersection here this thing and we are boom boom like here I think we have that and we would be right here I believe let's go okay let's go for the next round Good Start very good start uh okay we're in the forest good well not really this looks like Europe again just from the Landscapes from the oh this is a bigger city okay a much bigger city um okay wait is this not Europe is this like Colombia Bogota Casino Bogota has a big mountain range towards East could this be Bogota okay let's let's scroll in what do we see we have a stadium first of all um you can't really see if there is some text we cannot read it um yeah maybe it doesn't feel as European once you zoom in the roofs the houses the I don't know the traffic cars this it just doesn't feel as European anymore I think Bogota is a good shot with that mountain range we can we can have a look at Bogota now see if it aligns properly uh with these mountains is it is it not there are some parks here are these the ones yeah it is it is yeah this road we can see how it turns here but that's the one yeah it is it is Bogota then yeah I recognize that yeah because of the mountain range gave it away uh to me at least now okay so we go up here we have this thing this is Golf Course here and we have these kind of grids grid houses very interesting grids with some trees in the middle cool looking so we are um right here I believe right here east of this park very good very good let's go now well admittedly I am playing kind of an easier map yeah we'll see if I can find all of these cities this one is a very big one look even bigger than Bogota now what is this we have water we have water right next to us we have an airport here towards the south of the city um at first that was Japan but um but but let's zoom in let's have a look which side are we driving on the Wallace lots of Red Roofs and blue roofs very colorful roofs well that's not Europe for sure maybe something like Indonesia or something uh maybe we should I be driving on here or driving the right side here looks like we are driving the right side um so maybe the Philippines then I don't know actually I'm actually driving the right side just want to be extra sure not to go down the wrong path here they are looking at the windshields of the cars yeah it's it's we're driving in the right side for sure so the Philippines is my best shout I think which is all the other options I had in my mind like Japan Malaysia Indonesia I'll drive on the left side come on uh do we have the sun do we have the shadow directions which which way do the Shadows go Shadows go slightly to the north yeah uh so we would be in the northern hemisphere they think Philippines is a good shout such a big city is this ever Manila oh it is it is this this this uh Port thingy peer Port I don't know it matches with Manila yeah it is Manila actually okay so our deduction was right it is the Philippines but uh now the how do I unselect it uh okay uh now we get a pinpoint pinpoint this oh this might be really challenging actually to pinpoint so we have this circular roundabout up there do we see it that's the one croissant Memorial Circle I think that that's the one so now going south of it we have this intersection so this is uh which one so I think this University or high school is here I think looks like the same looks like it matches so this would be like the first second oh I think this is like the K Fourth Street somewhere [Music] the one two three look for the fourth house somewhere here this is that does that fit let's maybe go like one or two more houses to the left let's see okay very good very good now next one number four round number four oh no oh no what the hell is this now is this like Brazil or something this looks tricky for sure we have red soil we are wait are we doing left or right here which side are we driving on the cars look like we're driving in the left side are we really Yahweh we definitely are driving the left side this was Brazil but why is everyone driving on the left side what is this then what is this then no way that's a one directional Street such a big one could this ever be India but the sun is looking at the the Shadows of the clouds the Sun appears to be slightly to the north South Africa Botswana South Africa could that be it this is so much Greenery here a very green and foresty area could this beak in the northeastern part of South Africa there is some Greenery like that there maybe this is difficult like it's a relatively big city there is a stadium here and it texts not that we can read is there an air there is like an air Air Field I guess not really an airport an airfields towards the east of the city what's the biggest city in this area Queen doesn't work I'm not even sure but it is South Africa might be something else but but I don't know what I don't know what they're Rivers all over the place here if you don't have any rivers here just some roads and forests is that this might be a river you know this is a river could this could this ever be Uganda Kenya maybe me are more like Kenya I could work with the sun Direction the river I don't know this might be such a small River it might not even show up on the map you're always think about that as well so we have a city kind of like Kenya the most now as a guess like it more than South Africa I would say for this location but where where there is this one road that looks kind of more visible than others you know what I mean this one that goes through here through the city and keeps going north um so somewhere up here we're looking for a road that goes north wouldn't be up here I think there is some coverage there but no wouldn't be as green there there's this this foresty area but I don't know how but that could work yeah I don't know y'all I don't know I've been scanning Kanye all over the place can't find anything that really works well which sucks maybe it's not Kenya after all it's just my my best guess so I think we should just guess somewhere in the middle somewhere um here let's see um ah it was Kenya it was it was here oh there is the airstrip yeah oh I don't know I yeah I don't think I would have found this yeah no no no oh yeah yeah well kind of Bittersweet feeling about that round because it was really difficult but I was hoping for perfect score would have been nice now what is this we have some blue roofs that's the first thing that I noticed we have a river going through the city a pretty big city okay so we have an Air Force airport an airport lots of blue rooms whoa so blue roofs wait we have a big railroad Network here could this be Japan which side are we driving on I'm driving on the right side what the hell come on um okay maybe not Japan then huh but are we driving we are driving on the right side yeah dragging the right side with all of these blue rooms huh Korea I think we might have some Korean uh it's really hard to see but I'm thinking those might be some Korean uh like letters on the road potentially there's some yellow middle lines I think you can't see some yellow little Midlands in uh Korea the South Korea maybe could this be Taiwan maybe maybe maybe but okay Korea would be my main guess you have some like a base base ball I know baseball is big in Japan but what does this say here Champions feel guangzuki Guangzhou Guangzhou wasn't Guangzhou a city there is Guangzhou somewhere as well could this ever be China I know it's baseball big in China no idea about that no baseball is big in Japan but this is not Japan was a city in Korea oh my God okay it was curry after all ah I thought okay I had a brain fart fair enough Guangzhou okay so we are in Korea as as I initially suspected we are in the beautiful city of Guangzhou as we all know it's in Korea and uh okay so now we have this River going through so that aligns everything fits in that regard now we have this smaller River going through we are north of that we are south of this turn somewhere here let's zoom in so we have this turn in the road we are close to here or we are we where are we there is this like an empty spot here between the high buildings I think we would be right here there's this road going in that direction Road in that direction we're in between the two very good very good let's go let's see the results uh I wish it was a perfect score but what can you do if you did play along let me know in the comments how you did did you manage to get that sneaky Kenyan round or not did you get a perfect score there if you like the video press that like button and on the right side there will be another satellite view video I think you will enjoy huge thanks all of my patrons and YouTube members for

really cool and interesting map with hand-picked locations in public squares Etc so yeah I thought we could play this a little bit see how we do I've played this map a while ago and I enjoyed it so I thought let's let's play it again so let's play No moving what's the time limit to like I don't know two minutes let's say plenty of time and challenge of course the links in the description played before watching this video so I don't spoil anything so let's get going okay here we go so the first of all when I sing this my first thought was Peru just feeling like South America with Peru but let's look around is it actually Peru is it something else we have a white Google car which you could can get in per room and in a few other countries but but definitely in Peru as well um what else what else do we have I'm looking for electricity counters which can be helpful in um South America but I can't really notice any with this talk talks though I'm oh wait here are some are they Peruvian actually not entirely sure it's hard to see in Peru the electricity counters have these like show like um narrow rectangle rectangular holes this one looks big like a big hole which would make me think what would that make me think um could this ever be Bolivia or no I would still go Peru this one this one looks good the left one looks kind of Peruvian I hope we have a flag oh my god of course we have a flag of course we have a flag yeah it's a Peruvian Flag so that kind of confirms my suspicions um with um the tuk-tuks tuk-tuks um as far as and there are more Flags here uh two are more common in Northern bar of Peru as far as I'm aware you can see the model everywhere but uh and a more so towards the north so let's go okay yeah I'm happy with that it was more kind of in the jungle in the National Reserve Reservoir but yeah still happy with my guests there let's move on okay yeah Lithuania with the first glance I was thinking could this be Latvia but uh I felt the parking signs look a little bit different so yeah Lithuania makes perfect sense we have a flag recipe oh we can't move around there might be a city name somewhere there potentially now which city could this be any any City Clues again this this one could have some useful info but it's a bit too far again so we might need to just guess blindly on which I cannot read what it says yeah no way I'm reading the that text unfortunately all the text we have is a bit too far unfortunately this time but it's definitely Lithuania we know that much so let's go doesn't seem like a very big city maybe um to me kind of let's go with the I know paneer veggies Maybe oh it actually was let's go let's go I'll take it I'll take it didn't feel like Wilner so I've been to shaolia I didn't feel like shaolai to me so didn't feel that Coastal so I don't know if I just made sense to me what do we have we have us and I don't know what the flag what flag the state flag that is so that's lovely there is nothing else here either you know the flag or you don't that sucks because I don't know these these these blue state flags like half of the states have Flags like this not the greatest in sense of telling them apart from the distance um yeah I feel like we just gotta guess here because um I'm getting I don't know maybe could this be I don't know like just from The Vibes I'm thinking maybe kind of more Eastern and northeastern part of us maybe Richmond could this be no idea let's go somewhere there okay not bad it was kind of Eastern Northeast it actually was Pennsylvania I wanted to guess Pennsylvania at first but then kind of Switched oh well still still I'm very happy with my guest there now okay we have a Portuguese with this little C with a tail this c c a o that the combination is very common in Portuguese no I think I think that's a Brazilian flag as well there uh I was hoping to see some phone codes but no phone codes here wait CJ no I didn't see that that can't be the territory abbreviation probably Alfonso Pena no idea no idea well somewhere in Brazil we have some like palm trees kind of tropical um let's go I don't know could this ever be like Rio San Paulo a kind of outskirts of the city or or maybe no Bello Horizonte let's go below Horizonte I don't know I was actually real damn it I should just keep my first long a Brazil again any phone codes this time or we have some BR 101 um there is br-101 does it go out of the capital BR 101 oh wait does it say ES which one was es Espiritu Santo or something where was that e s e s where is yes here's yes Espirito santoya here 101 here it is um San Mateos Mateos here it is San Mateos we are not in San Mateos though this is the direction too summer tails to our north kind of it seems so could we be like here linhardes or something does it say here maybe um [Music] yes so we're looking for so we are in in that City Lin Harris somewhere here Clinica we have Clinica somewhere 5K this that would be pretty epic Clinic I don't see Clinica sorry so anywhere here I'm pretty sure we should be somewhere on one of these roads here because they align and we have one bigger road going going there oh and we are out of time so let's go somewhere ah oh okay more more there okay fair enough fair enough it wasn't the big road then okay but almost a 5k I'll take it really good game I thought really really good game I feel like maybe we get a bit lucky with the locations as well because you can although that us one was a not a very um easy one I thought so 21.7 K okay let's let's go and let's do another one let's do another one um I can link in the description of course so um and if you do play along let me know in the comments how you do what are your scores I'm always interested to hear if you managed to beat me or not you know this feels kinda Baltic maybe um it is yeah Lithuania nice which is again similar to Latvia but not entirely just something felt different and lots of Amber you will see lots of Amber souvenirs in baltics in particular yeah that's that's a very common Jewel this is is it Jewel like Stone I guess brolyst Timber I don't think brolis is a city name taravas is the letter taravas taravus [Music] i don't no wait this is a clipart I think it's a clay pad over there uh which would make me think it might be clipad um and I could see this being maybe like a coastal city um this is like a square well yeah this is the town squares map uh Broly Timber somewhere here is there a fountain we're running out of time let's just guess let's just keep it somewhere there I guess and see okay not too bad close enough close enough almost a 5k I'll Good Start good start I'll take it I didn't find it exactly unfortunately though um okay we have a Chilean flag this time I notice a flag when I see when we have their Chilean poles as well uh car is not visible gen 4. so which city would this be in Chile Da Vinci there definitely is a city mentioned here somewhere but I just can't read it this this feels I would say south of Santiago like Chilean or something conception maybe maybe even more self I don't know um yeah I don't know just Just Vibe guessing because I I don't see any readable city names yeah let's just get somewhere there okay not too bad actually it was a smaller town okay I'm happy with this actually a really close guess just by The Vibes I'll I'll take it I feel like I'm doing pretty good today but admittedly some lucky guesses as well now Estrella Estrella uh huh okay this would be Brazil no with this antenna you get the Santana in a few countries Brazil being one of them we have some white license plates on the cars and I think these are Brazilian poles no I think of Advocates no no phone code unfortunately that could have helped I am not entirely sure we're in Brazil I'm thinking maybe something like um I don't know could this be Parana I don't see any piranha Pines um could this be like matogroso goyas I don't know kind of hilly a little bit could it be more South Santa Catarina I'm really torn all over the place I don't know where in Brazil this is um now I don't know let's go let's go kind of kind of parana-ish if it is one of those States then then it was matogros so yeah yeah uh oh well yeah I it was one of my options but I had too many to choose from again it feels kind of uh is it oh it's Latvia no I thought it's Lithuanian again it is Latvian okay okay is here now where though I think I've been here I think I did like a geocaching somewhere here now or was that a different Tower [Music] I think it is this one like uh this is the church this is the monument to be honest chalkster the first president and [Music] so we would be here right this is an old coverage because lot Telecom changed the like the brand changed the the design and everything so so it wouldn't make sense that it shows different it's this is BTA uh insurance so that's still the same here but yeah I think we would be like right there nice perfect what do we have now Coca-Cola oh a nice um mural the month where are we we have Generation 4 sun is to the north a little bit where are we heading Altamira Centro Cal polycon I don't know any of those places that's not good the pole not entirely sure would this be I'm not entirely sure would this be Chile again um hmm would this be Chile again like some of the polls kinda remind me of Chilean ones and I don't think we have Argentinian plates um because we're running out of time what are the places no it's not chilling I am not sure on this one I wish I had a bit more time maybe um it was Chile ah I misjudged how South it would be it was did it say on the bus I'm not sure um not as good as the first game could have been a little bit better but overall also not too bad some some good guesses here as well uh so yeah if you played along let me know how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks all of my patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope y'all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path":

every week along with other members of the community and then later see who did better did you beat me did you not beat me compare the results if you want to join the link will be in the description everyone's welcome to join in so here we go here we go uh all the player on links as always in the description two minutes no moving uh good luck good luck okay so what's creepy funny weird okay this is a bit creepy isn't it some sort of a abandoned Tower abandoned places are always kind of creepy but they have some some sort of appeal as well the way okay okay there's a Santa here I wasn't planning on it but I guess it goes well with the time of the year we have some okay Portuguese I don't think we have the area code on the phone numbers not that I can see at least well this should be Brazil but with a Portuguese language but without the area codes ah yeah yeah with these Green Mountains I would I would be thinking more towards south of Brazil maybe yeah I don't see any other um Clues let's go I was thinking maybe somewhere near San Paulo maybe somewhere down here let's see okay not too bad very close to Rio De Janeiro actually what was that place Park Alba Noel Park Alba Noel is an abandoned Christmas themed Park in Brazil yeah so next one um some sort of a small mini Village oh is this uh I know there is a village like this in um was it Austria there I don't know if this is the one maybe this is the different one yeah it's okay it's in English here not not Austria then in Geo detective we had one location in Austria I believe it was with a lot of these smaller houses these are really cool and I also went to like a small uh kind of mini town in Poland as well they had one but I would think this would be UK with English and the architecture as well feels quite British so that's that's my thinking here member of lower crackpot is lower crack but the location's name or member of lower crackpot huh okay I know UK has some very weird location names for sure so I wouldn't be surprised if they have a lower crack but somewhere too oh let's go maybe somewhere in England huh the architecture did not look Australian at all maybe it was some sort of like a British museum in Australia what was that place tasma Zia and the village of lower crackpot well there is the lower crackpot theme park with mazes and a tiny village okay interesting I was not thinking Australia at all to be honest the houses looked so British I guess if it's supposed to represent some old houses I guess makes sense that they might look British okay so from the first glance I'm thinking um Asia right with these these roofs with um kind of Curves a very very Asian feeling now which country this is adorable adorable Google should cover all the faces like this instead of blurring them would be much cuter we have some monks here huh I think that looks kind of like a monk what would this be could this be Nepal for some reason Nepal came to my mind maybe because of the monks I kind of associate monks with Nepal is that language those kind of look like they might be Chinese characters I I don't know I will go not I'll go in the park I don't know no uh I don't know it was China it was China after all what was that place Mughal caves the Pagoda of maitreya bod di sativa okay a very rural rural China there okay fair enough oh okay this is an interesting location for sure what is that animal supposed to be some sort of a squirrel or squirrel standing next to a big tree slot oh sloth that's supposed to be a sloth this is a Sloth Sanctuary sloths used to be my favorite animal for for a moment when I was younger um this shape this shape looks like South America and this kind of looks like North America now I I think that's that's what I first thought when I saw this shape so maybe it's somewhere there maybe one of the Caribbean islands because this place does have that Island D feel doesn't it with English language as well yeah I don't know where sloths in which countries you can find them bottom Saint Vincent and the Grenadines maybe Bahamas could this be Bahamas I didn't know they have Adelaide in Bahamas huh learning something new Cogburn town okay anyways the time is up let's let's guess where where the plonk it down here let's see it was a Costa Rica okay I mean Central America makes sense as well it's just we had only English so Spanish-speaking countries wouldn't have been my first guest there kind of the right area could have been a better guess but could have been worse as well now what is this place some sort of a like a track or what is this like a prison is this Lithuania the sun kind of feels Lithuanian the language looks like the words end with a s it's a common uh word ending in Lithuanian I have no idea what this place is oh hey I just noticed the author's name is the lift Vilnius so yeah it is Lithuania I'm glad I recognized it before early reading the author's name though the author's name says Vilnius so maybe we are near Vilnius Maybe I don't know what this place would be though let's go somewhere a bit West of Vilnius somewhere there let's see completely opposite side when closed Lefty actually what was that place National Park War Museum okay yeah I haven't been there before but it's pretty close to Riga so maybe I could go one day who knows how did we do in total 11 400 points could have been a better score but uh some of their ones were really tricky I thought let's go for one more game I think I can do better than 11 000 hopefully good luck hello okay a very small Church on the top of a hill this feels like oh gosh is this McMurdo Station or no I'm kinda getting mcmurdal station Vibes here I know there was like a small Church there I've seen it from the distance not from up close so I don't know if this is the one I think there was or maybe there was a big cross instead of a church I don't remember but this this kind this kind of houses feels like some sort of uh like a this is either somewhere very North or very south uh where is McMurdo McMurdo is here could it be somewhere there is some sort of a chapel here in the water Chapel of the snow which could this be Chapel of the Snows Maybe Chapel of this note maybe this is the cross that I've seen from afar this might be the one that I was thinking because I've seen like a big cross in the McMurdo Station before so I think that's my best guess let's see let's see very punishing very punishing I mean I was 4 000 kilometers away I got Antarctica right but still I was so far away but was this base Presidente Eduardo Frey montal montalva Trinity Church it was kinda had the right right idea there but but yeah we wouldn't have guessed it there big Lizzy huh this is the big Lizzy is this some sort of like a big tractor or or uh or what is this I'm not sure big Lizzy is giving me an Australian Vibes big Lizzy think digital teaching tomorrow's technology today where where are you teaching it it might say that a location name somewhere but all the other other words are blurred out um I don't think this would be Perth uh I hope it isn't um so I would maybe guess but we didn't see any plates to do any uh no um New South Wales Maybe Wagga Wagga is there a big Lizzy in Wagga Wagga not really but let's go somewhere there okay not too bad it was new South the whales I was right about that it was Red Cliffs there is the big Lizzy right there what is Big Lizzy let's search it up big Lizzy was an enormous tractor used to clear vast expanses of land around the river at the Red Cliffs Soldier settlement that's what big Lizzy is fair enough fair enough let's see what's the next one okay what okay there is a body as well at first I didn't see the giraffe body so uh but it's still very interesting this is such a crazy location what surely this is some sort of like a national park or something right not many clues that we see very giraffe oriented a lot of giraffe statues giraffe pictures obviously a big giraffe itself so some sort of giraffe Sanctuary maybe or something like that but I don't know where that would be my guess would be in Africa somewhere but but but about the country maybe something like Tanzania I think Tanzania has a lot of natural reserves and national parks so maybe somewhere there let's see okay it was Kenya Nairobi that was oh gosh I wouldn't have guessed it was so close to the city center giraffe sent her Giraffe Manor that's crazy so cool so cool if I ever visit Kenya I want to go to the giraffe Center see giraffes in real life okay what is this now we have a flag right this flag it is yeah we have some Chinese this is the um Taiwan flag right I'm not the best with flags but I think it should be and this is official coverage as well yeah that's also a good thing to notice a very interesting building here and some sort of I'm guessing this is some sort of a memorial for soldiers quite liquid mountainous generally like the kind of eastern part is more helium mountainous in Taiwan but you can get some hills here as well let's go maybe near taipe in the South where there are some more Hills somewhere here ish maybe let's see okay it was north of Taipei still pretty good guess it was zooming Museum and soft drink shop is nearby apparently hey hugging the holy pole nice it's always nice to see holy poles in real life I haven't seen the Romanian ones but I've seen the Polish holy poles so uh it was a nice experience next time I see a Romanian holy pole I also want to hug it but this should be Romania with this pole I believe although in hunger you can get some similar looking ones as well to be honest so could this be Hungary maybe I think these bowls kind of in the background look more Hungarian than Romanian to me cephilicro in Romania these these empty like these holes would be longer so I'm starting to lean more towards Hungary here also in Romania quite often you see like a yellow sticker on these um holy poles so that would be another clue why it might be Hungary instead and again a little hilly yeah let's go kind of more maybe somewhere east of Budapest somewhere in that area maybe okay okay it was north of Budapest but it was Hungary pretty good guess I would say how did we do in total 17 000 points now that's more like it if only the Antarctica guess would have been closer their score would have been even better if you play it along let me know in the comments did you manage to beat me how did you do in these games and don't forget to join the 2023 geographer pro league that I made the

time and in this video we're gonna play some Christmas related Maps the first one is going to be famous Christmas places and no one has played this before we're gonna be the first so the play along links will be in the description as always now moving two minutes per round let's go okay okay okay um doesn't look very wintery but but okay what do we have we have uh something baptism we have we have some sort of a flag with white and red on it I don't think that's a country flag is it ah yeah yeah yeah what else do we have can we find what's Christmasy here could this be Jerusalem the buildings kinda I think would fit with that area since this is a Christmas famous Christmas Place map um yeah my guess would probably be here in Jerusalem now where uh Monastery of the Cross could centuries all the Eastern Orthodox Monastery I mean maybe this is this looks like an old building might be centuries-old Monastery for all I know um it's right in the middle of Jerusalem so I think that's a pretty good guess even if it isn't there shouldn't be too far I imagine okay uh it was oh Bethlehem of course it was better church of nativity storied ancient 4th Century Church okay I was in the area okay I was in the area now what is this here um looks like we have some um yellow license plates would this be Christmas Islands okay yeah yeah yeah okay these are Christmas Islands um funny funny I mean they are Christmas related for sure we have water to our North so we can see the island more to the to the West so Christmas Islands you can find here we would be somewhere all the way up here right so I think here we can see this thing and then further in the distance we can see all of this suck on the coast there we have like like an intersection here by almost um going to be somewhere here all the way it does look like the road ends and there might be a kind of kind of turn to the right so maybe we are somewhere uh like like here on this a Rocky Point Chris what is Chris yeah let's go there we were close pretty good only lost one point there uh Michael J Hughes uh now what is Christmasy here was maybe like a Christmas movie filmed here like home alone or or Santa Claus or something I'm not sure feels like that sort of neighborhood if anyone knows let me know in the comments what what's Christmasy here now this would be North America I can't read that sign the license plate um just by The Vibes going by The Vibes I would maybe go kind of kind of North East ish something like Massachusetts Connecticut somewhere here maybe a Chicago Chicago makes sense okay Santa Park oh and Santa part now would this be Finland Lapland Santa Claus oh I'm gonna find this Arctic Circle oh yeah yeah yeah where was how can I find it somewhere here it was somewhere near this Rover near me right I think it was somewhere there Santa Park is this the one or is this a different one maybe this is a different Santa Village I imagine they're probably multiples it is a Santa Park so I think it should be this one and it also looks very much like Finland doesn't it the language I think would fit right I haven't been there myself though but but could be a an interesting destination this is unofficial so we can't really trust the compass as always wait is that a um a gas station there do we have ghosts we have parking here Arctic house I don't see any gas stations here let's get somewhere here okay it was all the way here okay oh there there was that that the gas station and so well um Santa's house of snowmobile Santa's house of snowmobiles he's been upgrading the the reindeers huh Rudolph the Red-nosed snowmobile now we are in some sort of a church now would this be Vatican or or what what kind of a church this could be of Christmas related Vatican comes to mind first but I don't know very fancy looking that's that's all I can say I was thinking maybe somewhere in Spain as well but I guess the obvious guess would be Vatican maybe cause cause the Basilica the San ped Pietro is like like this cross-shaped so it looks like this this church would be cross-shaped and then this one would fit so yeah let's go somewhere there let's go perfect let's view the summary to almost 22 000 points the Chicago round being the uh most punishing one the other ones I did quite well quite well the next round we have is a Christmas World which also should contain a bunch of Christmas related locations so let's go again the challenge Link in the description and let's see oh okay this is somewhere very cold isn't it we have a cross but um and this is an official coverage is this one of the uh Antarctic Villages research stations Maybe in these very Northern and very Southern locations you cannot trust the Sun by the way so the direction doesn't really mean much here uh I wanna guess somewhere uh in Antarctica maybe because I feel like I've seen a very similar um like like research station slash Village there or or this might be somewhere in Greenland of course but I would go maybe somewhere McMurdo Station I don't know if that's the one or not but but that's the one that I know let's see okay okay let's go it was McMurdo didn't get a 5k but I'm super happy that I guess the right research station oh gosh what is this now um we have a Christmas tree saying wonder and you were a bunch of us Flags so I would imagine this might be in the US a very small Church something historical probably outside okay outside it looks very green uh so even though we have a Christmas tree inside outside it doesn't look very wintery at all so I'm thinking maybe quite Southern then something like Florida California something like that yeah besides that I don't really see anything useful yeah let's go let's go something like I don't know Alabama let's go Alabama why not Sweet Home Alabama okay it wasn't as South as I had thought it was Indiana the very south of Indiana here let's go next round this is okay okay we're in a store are in the middle middle of the street again doesn't look super wintery outside we're driving on the right side of the road looks European The Vibes the signs I don't know which country though uh um I'm thinking maybe Germany Maybe looking at the buildings maybe Northern Germany maybe something like maybe Hamburg maybe Hanover let's go Hanover I think that's that's kind of safer uh a safer bet in case it's something else if it even is Germany let's see okay oh it was just Berlin okay kind of Northern Germany still let's move on I don't I didn't recognize that boss maybe that was some some um city bus if you knew that one that's that's a big Advantage there is this a museum or a store off of bunch okay it is a store of Christmas decorations Christmas okay so looking down phase off this time Christmas shop Prague imagine if it isn't Prague if we've been debated now that would be something well the prices are not in Euros so that would check out with Prague right if this is 400 euros uh that would raise some eyebrows for sure Prague real goose egg oh oh a real goose egg I I don't suppose we're gonna find Christmas shop just browsing like this from above so but I imagine this might be somewhere Central um so let's go maybe Prague one Prague one is like this area here all old town somewhere near Old Town let's see on the other side the other side Christmas shop there it is now so we have a lot of kind of artificial Christmas trees this time looks like a very warm and tropical Place The Sweet Spot is here and some Pokemon Santa Claus Training Academy so we have some English English kind of warm I would think maybe something like the Philippines people look like they might be from the Philippines I would say okay it was let's go and let's view the summary 22 095 points and the last game is the game of Christmas Market we play this map in the last year's video already but let's play it again because it's a great map it has 150 Christmas markets and over 40 countries so let's see maybe we get some locations we had before maybe not probably even if we do I won't remember them let's be real so let's see what do we have here now this would be Europe coffee pot veg something I'm trying to read the texts but most of them are not very readable um I was thinking I was thinking something like um Jackie Slovakia maybe something like uh Slovenia could this be okay we do have the blue strip here I don't know the architecture maybe I'm leaning more towards Slovenia because of the architecture the houses but very not sure let's go with the other click um maribor let's go maribor let's see was it I was Slovakia ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the lovely city of ternava tricky tricky yeah I couldn't tell by the language itself unfortunately there what do we have here welcome hey okay welcome to Bethlehem okay this time I know to go to Bethlehem so again I think this this is the same same church we had before isn't it looks very similar to what we had in that first game so I guess let's go there so now where was it exactly uh church of nativity here we go there's like a like a square town square to one side of the church um is that this is the Town Square here not sure not sure let's go somewhere here ish maybe assuming that the Town Square is selected to the east of that church okay okay it was all the way here still really good guess let's go oh gosh okay it does load good good good very Christmasy I like Christmas marks they have the unique vibe to them we have a lovely doggo here adorable adorable what's the language um K-pop hot dog doesn't help too much kebabs and hot hot dogs okay this L would make me think that this is French and we have Euros yeah we do have euros um so oh dot FR yeah we have dot fr so this is definitely France then with all these clues that we've seen I don't think there's a way to tell which city this is all right this might be just Paris Hotel that says it says phase isn't a city is it hotel that says let's just leave a plonk in Paris for now and let's just glance over maybe maybe we can see says which probably isn't a city even just just in case just in case yeah no says no says here so let's just go uh Paris and see oh it was Bordeaux this is pretty a lot of people here a lot of people so we have German language would this be Germany would this be Berlin I feel like I should recognize these these buildings but I don't there isn't too much to see besides the language here that we saw maybe someone recognizes these buildings but uh let's go Berlin let's go Berlin maybe let's see it was Berlin what were those houses Deutscher Dome and frontus oh okay have I seen them in real life I don't think so I've been to Berlin twice I don't think I've visited those I don't think so now what is this round number five oh this is Helsinki right this this huge stairs um huge steps I've been here in real life before how can I find it oh it should be big should it be big and hopefully easy to find Central big is it here no it's it's not there oh yeah I can't find anything that would really match I don't think um so but I'm pretty sure it was in Helsinki um I just don't know where now let's see let's see Universe here all the way 19th century religious edifice and I just realized I forgot to admire the Christmas Market so let's have a quick look looks like a pretty big one a lot a lot of these stalls here how did we do in total again very close to 22 000 I'm living around that Mark today how did you do if you played along let me know in the comments and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to another and Merry

"https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/uvuWrqyzVH9cDvxm"], "transcript": "hello hello and welcome back to another Geo guesser Play Along video as you can see the developers have released a new UI design which I'm quite excited about I think it looks really nice you'll probably take some time to find where everything is located but but I really like how it looks anyways uh in this video we are gonna play some uh play along games in the um strangest what was the name strangest official coverage I saw this map here being popular I thought let's try it out places you would have never guessed are covered by Google so oh I'm expecting some really tough locations the average score is 8.8 000 uh so the player long links as always will be in the description we'll be playing no moving let's set that time limit to maybe like two minutes a little longer than usual so if anyone wants they can kind of spend a little bit extra time looking around oh gosh okay here we go looks like some sort of a National Park from the first glance I was thinking somewhere in Africa potentially but we have some signs maybe we can read something Rock something a rock it's not helping too much is it where's the sun the sun would be to our North okay so could this maybe be Australia actually these trees do feel quite Australian don't they these um these I think these are eucalyptus trees right oh wait but this this tree looks like a ball Bob you can get some eucalyptus trees in South Africa and I imagine in Madagascar as well bandagascar has like if I remember correctly six out of nine types of baobabs you can find in Madagascar Madagascar does some some weird tracker coverage like this so I think Madagascar is a really good shot with the Sun to the north as well let's go I don't know where um let's maybe go somewhere like western coast here I talked myself out of going Australia oh God damn it God damn it that Baobab Tree betrayed me well apparently you can find Bob Trees in Northern Australia as well didn't know that one okay what is this now we have a boat coverage uh about coverage um report coverage is in a lot of places actually what would this be we have a plane as well this is a tough map just as I expected very flat looking no mountains in sight I don't know I don't know I'm thinking maybe Brazil um I can't see any like helpful really helpful Clues here so I'm just going going with my gut I don't know where's the sun the sun is South maybe this is just somewhere Asia or Africa could this ever be Europe could this ever be Europe should I switch to Europe oh gosh maybe I should should I okay I I I will I don't know which country to guess though in Europe a boat like this I don't I don't know uh Poland I think I might have seen like like a boat coverage once in Poland long time ago ah it was USA oh wow oh and I have never seen coverage here I can tell you that much South pass light interesting Brazil would have been a little closer but still wouldn't have gotten too many points there so oh gosh why did I choose this map I knew it's gonna be terrible why did I choose this map uh this could be anywhere literally we're in the far in the middle of a forest where is the sun the sun is to the South okay well could this ever be something like Hong Kong or Taiwan for some reason I was thinking Asia but I don't have any particular clues why just just Vibes I don't know my vibes might be very wrong here fine I'll go Hong Kong but one of these Mountain Sparks I'm very much in that confident here this is rough very northern Guatemala well if you got that right let me know in the comments how because batteries are often okay what do we have here we are actually in the city instead of a middle of a forest now okay we have a blue plate and some Chinese language so we are in China interestingly enough some kind of scary and creepy looking metal guys the kind of looks like they're laughing but but very creepily anyways is this in Beijing so China does have some coverage um mostly in museums though I don't think I've seen this coverage before which is very interesting they have coverage in other cities as well besides Beijing well maybe it says the city somewhere here in Chinese but I can't read it I was thinking maybe something like Shanghai maybe I I don't see anything that I could use let's go kind of West of Shanghai somewhere there I was just Beijing should have just plonked it in the capital huh okay this looks like the is this Greenland or is this not Greenland um orc this side only I feel this might be something like Alaska could it be like like did Purdue Bay have coverage I think a couple of these places are far far north had some coverage some thinking might be somewhere there potentially or maybe one of these uh towns and settlements on the west coast we have whales here hello innovik maybe could this be innovik we have some water with some hills nearby Maybe I think that might be my best guess here because without moving around can't really see any plates or any other Clues so yeah let's let's keep it there let's see ah well oh that was McMurdo Station that was a rough one and the sun was and the sun was to the South but you can't really trust sun when these super polar locations as well well that was a terrible game oh 2900 points let's play again I I have to do better I have to do better than this let's go for another one let's see okay we are in a town is this Molly by any chance yeah I think this this stand is found in Mali oh this is a really interesting structure what is this what is this looks so interesting but I have no idea what it is for it should be Molly though I'm pretty sure yeah a lot of people might not know that Molly has coverage I think I will go I think I've seen some coverage in the Mako but I think there is some coverage in team book two as well maybe maybe another cities too or maybe I should go Timbuktu because this does feel super super deserty I don't know let's see nice okay it was Timbuktu what was that place it was oh it was a mosque huh interesting very interesting looking mosque if that was it okay we have big mountains uh big mountains and and trees my first thought was maybe Alps uh maybe not super confident about that though but it looks like the whole landscape just reminds me of those those Alp pictures and videos that you see online the house I could see this house being in all so why not right I mean maybe this is somewhere in the the um North America Maybe but I I I feel Alps are more likely here shall we go Switzerland Austria or Northern Italy let's go maybe Northern Italy somewhere near the borders somewhere around that area let's see oh okay so Slovakia all the way wow so not really Alps but close nearby Slovakia does have some really beautiful landscapes for sure oh are we in China again this is a different location but again we have the Blue Plate it's a good thing to note this in China they do use blue a blue license plates on regular cars so um yeah we would be in China again so is this Beijing again or is it something else this time all the non-chinese text is not very readable unfortunately so if you are able to read some Chinese that's that might be a good Advantage here Ahmad something Amada Plaza I think I might just go Beijing because it does feel kind of similar to that previous Chinese round we had so maybe again kind of East it was like in the East right somewhere here I don't know let's see it was almost the place where I guess that the previous time are you for real oh of course it's gonna be like that of course okay anyways um okay what is this oh is this India by any chance this time looks like we are driving on the left side here with some tuk-tuks medicam the languages hard to read it looks like we have Urdu language though on the sign do we have baggy pants we have baggy pants baggy pants meta I see a couple of baggy pants in case you haven't watched my tip videos you know leave them in the info card a good way to tell India and Pakistan apart is that in Pakistan quite often people will be wearing some baggy pants I I call it baggy pants meta so that that's a good way to tell the the two apart of course language if you see language that might be another one because in Pakistan they use Urdu so in Pakistan I think there is coverage in Lahore I think there might have been some in Hyderabad I think I'll go Lahore I had never kind of paid attention that there is hither Abad in both Pakistan and India that that sounds like it could get confusing fast but okay I'll go Lahore might be a different city but it should be Pakistan I think okay it was Lahore nice nice this game is going way better what is this now so in in we're in the middle of an airplane we can't see outside we can't see if we are uh in the air or not or oryx and this is official how is this official why is this official Qatar if you pay enough Google will cover anything maybe if I pay enough Google will cover my bedroom as well to include in the official view um let's just go somewhere on the airport there let's see yeah of course what a great coverage by Google and how did we do 21 300 points let's go a way better game than the first one let me know in the comments how you did if you played along and on the right side there will be some more play along games I think you will enjoy huge thanks

football related let's play football stadiums of the world I don't really know that much about football I know almost nothing about football to be honest but um maybe I do well maybe there's some other Clues let's do one minute per round all the links if you want to play along will be in the description as always so you have very good chances of beating me in this map for sure so what what I first noticed is that everything is orange well I know orange is the color of the Netherlands they really like the or orange everywhere so could this be the Netherlands kghm absolutely no idea what that means where where this football club might be from uh I was hoping for some texts maybe but but this not a very text Heavy location oh we have oh we have some language uh we have a y we have a j this this language feels quite uh Slovak maybe Slovak or Czech because we have 14 seconds remaining really not that much time okay I think I'm gonna go Slovakia maybe um let's go Bratislava um where is that can I find a stadium in this time probably not and it was Paul was it polish I foreign [Music] okay but still okay definitely definitely a better guess than um Netherlands closer but uh didn't recognize that it was a Polish language oh gosh what is this oh football fans and their um smokes I I think they're celebrating right people seem to be quite Smiley and happy so that's not a riot at least that's good because I know football fans can get out of hand from what I've seen in the news um but because of these smokes I can't see anything really what does it say here um I can something best something best I can't read what it says because of the snow or no no it's not strasbour no no it's the we have a quite hilly these heel these mountains these houses I'm thinking maybe something like Germany Southern Germany where there is hillish Stuttgart or something Munich I don't know I know Southern Germany is hilly so let's go Southern Germany and they do like their football in Germany as well so oh it was Norway huh huh yeah yeah yeah well I don't know could I could I have how could I have told it was Norway maybe if I knew the football team or something well uh this famous building is in Singapore um where's the football stadium here oh oh this is the outdoors football stadium huh oh wow I did not recognize that this was a football stadium uh this would be Singapore um and let's try to find where in Singapore it would be um somewhere oh yeah where I know these buildings are in Singapore they are quite famous but where uh where in Singapore I'm not so sure about that anymore National Stadium there well this is a National Stadium for sure I feel like it would be around this area kind of quite Central okay the time is running out let's okay it was it was okay it was here the float not even a stadium it doesn't look like it's supposed to be a stadium a football field the float grandstand I guess it could use can be used for for maybe some football maybe some I don't know theater or something or okay okay okay pretty cool still I'm glad I recognized Singapore from that um just because I knew that famous place uh BC Place BC would this be British Columbia probably not wait there is a Canadian flag and a US flag maybe it is a British Columbia after all BC FC White Caps welcome to the new BC Place newbie C plus White Caps Pride lives here um I I guess I'm gonna go Beach British Columbia since we have Canadian flag it says BC everywhere uh we have English I don't see much else Public House yeah let's go um Vancouver I guess um where creep where is the stadium I don't know um let's just let's just plug it somewhere there and uh hope for the best let's go let's go there is that Stadium oh BC Place there it is there it is BC Place um maybe if I had more time maybe I could have found it but I'm very happy that I got the city right there so BC did stand for British Columbia after all then so that's good um the music Run Okay a i a what is it say Vitality Vitality doesn't help too much active tiger ball okay those are just some advertisements everywhere no access medic intervention a lot of English but it might be English just because it's an International Event that's a possibly the London Way start your day the London where are we in the law in in London healthier longer Better Lives AIA OTE area like that so everything's in English I'm guessing Kuala Lumpur then I almost went London I almost went London there because of that London away sign Kuala Lumpur um it was Kuala Lumpur all the way here to the stadium I think I'm doing pretty well actually 20 and a half thousand that's definitely better than I expected to do let's let's go for another one uh cause cause why not right i'm enjoy I'm actually enjoying this we have a flag we have a flag Romanian flag well probably Romanian not the Chad flag I would imagine so with this be in remaining so Romania versus Sweden the lovely Sweden um oh gosh so much trash left everywhere I like Japanese fan football fans because they clean up after themselves that's really nice of Japanese friends um so I'm rooting for Japan this Championship just because of that um we have T-Mobile well I don't know I I'm I would probably go Romania because because I see much more Romanian supporters than Swedish supporters here a lot of Romanian Flags I think it says Romania on that poster as well so let's go Bucharest and could be could be another city but but let's let's keep it in the capital again any stadiums uh it was not even Capital it was cryova rayova Stadium okay fair enough okay we have another some sort of a concert in a stadium here Allianz Park alian spark I feel like I've heard of alian spark but I I have zero idea where it was which country even so that's not good that's not good um Leon's language side the language looks Spanish to me I'm thinking Spain uh uh maybe it could be like something like Argentina as well or Mexico maybe I don't know I'm Gonna Keep It In oh it was Brazil after all Sao Paulo okay so I guess it was Portuguese not Spanish didn't see enough of the language to to tell tell them apart of I I know some some differences between the languages but but sometimes I still mix them up unfortunately well to be fair if if I saw Portuguese if I knew this Portuguese I likely would have gone Portugal there we have some UK UK flag we are Derby Derby County I don't know where Derby county is well this is UK uh um backyard coffee well Derby County uh the yard Derby Derby I only have 15 seconds remaining so unless it says Derby somewhere from this distance I'm not finding it Derby Derby Derby I don't see any dirt I don't know where Derby county is I'm sorry to my British fans um it was oh there is Derby oh now I see it yeah it's not even that small but I just didn't notice so that's that's unfortunate but still please and score decent score what is this Borussia or something I've heard of Borussia but where which country were they from at least I've heard of them huh right at least I've heard of them where would we be two words BVB um Stuart it's English so are we in UK again Heineken well these are like International companies they are not gonna help me much yeah I I don't know let's let's go with the UK again like foreign if I had bigger football knowledge then then surely I would have gotten that but yeah yeah that that one was Leon vile de Leon I know where Leon is Leon is right here so maybe it is in Lyon hmm can we find a stadium in Lyon I mean Leon is quite big it said somewhere here matmot Stadium we have but oh my god did I actually find it oh will I get a 5k no way no way well we can't really trust the uh Compass necessarily but let's let's assume it is kind of correct so let's go this side over the stadium oh my gosh oh I guess they were playing some some American football or something here with these goal posts let's see oh let's go I did not expect to get a perfect score in any of these rounds in this lap to be honest but got a bit lucky there with with finding Mahmoud Stadium immediately 70 000 points if you played a long let me know how you did in the comments below and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all the patrons and YouTube members who are supporting this channel I hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your

have played this map before you can get any country in the world in this one so gonna be challenging so if you want to play along the links will be in the description as always um so let's disable this uh and yeah good luck everyone if you don't know how to set up satellite view I will leave an info card up there it's quite easy and simple uh so yeah good luck good luck let's see where are we some are coastal I love Coastal locations because um they are a little bit easier to pinpoint usually but it doesn't look like we have a big city though we have a river we have Coast red Coast where do they have a red Coast very red um water there okay we have well yeah the water is to our North there is like an air strip here but looking at the rules my first thought was Brazil but uh we have some blurs we have some red robes maybe if not Brazil maybe it's something like Suriname or something like that can we see which side we are driving on that could be helpful potentially okay hard to see but we might be driving on the left side actually wait a minute well if we're drawing the left side then wait if we are driving on the left side I think like Suriname was driving on the left side now I think that does this River Work wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait does it work no no it doesn't no it doesn't they are driving on the left side but this is not Suriname unfortunately where where else could this be where are shadows going where are the Shadows going the Shadows are going looks like slightly to the north so it should be in the northern hemisphere then and which would work with the Suriname but it's not it's not Suriname it's by when the 12 drives on the right side it's not here then where like Malaysia or something what could this be a Malaysia wouldn't align no but oh maybe it would maybe it would what is this okay maybe it does a line but because as I have said before you can definitely get always you can definitely get some blue roofs in Asia and it looks like we found the river it aligns perfectly yeah yeah it is the similar it shouldn't be too difficult to um pinpoint right here let's go perfect score starting out well next location what do we have let's close this one something with water again something Coastal very edgy coast and the water looks very deep very deep water so I don't think it's gonna be a lake Big Lake should be should be like a sea or an ocean let's have a look at the city my first thoughts were maybe Canada has like this kind of very uh rough rough Coast in in some places but let's have a look let's have a look at the city we have a stadium driving in the right side and the Shadows are going uh to the north the road lines do we have a yellow it looks like we might have a yellow central line there right yellow central line eliminates a lot of countries let's have a look at Canada maybe then look Eastern Canada with with uh water to our Southeast somewhere up here this little island maybe could be of help maybe there are too many small Islands on the Canadian Coast it seems too many small Islands somewhere here again this could be anywhere not not only within in places with official coverage so that um makes things more difficult for sure could it be somewhere this far north I think we had some tunnels here I think I saw a tunnel somewhere uh which goes like into a mountain so it is a mountainous Place Coastal the yellow line in the middle what else could it be if not Canada or could it be Alaska maybe somewhere here oh I just realized I didn't set a timer of 10 minutes whoops Whoopsie Daisy I usually like to set a timer for 10 minutes so it doesn't take too long to find these locations hmm I'll try to limit limit the time myself so I don't spend the whole day uh recording this video maybe this is more like somewhere here maybe I've been looking too far north because this like Greenery doesn't feel that North as uh as as I was watching looking for so it might be more south after all but these cities are quite small so it's not gonna be like it's not gonna be Charleston for example I checked Philippines just in case but I couldn't find anything matching there either let's go with my first got Instinct it was somewhere in Canada but uh let's see it was North Korea I did check Philippines I didn't think of checking North Korea wow that's crazy I didn't know North Korea has yellow middle lines interesting interesting tricky tricky for sure oh gosh oh no no no what is this okay something Coastal again something Coastal we can't zoom too far out though oh God this looks really difficult because I don't think we see any cities here just some rocks and mountains and we can't even Zoom too far out so how am I supposed to find this we have some snow here it looks like the Shadows are going to the north so we would be in the northern hemisphere somewhere Coastal is that a city down no we I don't see any sense of civilization here no roads no cities no boats nothing nothing well I I don't think this would be Europe I don't think this would be South America could it be here somewhere no I think it would be way more green there as well I don't know I I don't think it is there it's ever be Alaska I always imagined Alaska to be greener than this I I don't think Alaska aligns what else could this be India I don't know India I imagine if this was India we would see some some houses or roads like here the fact that we have nothing confuses me could this be Chile no but the Shadows were going north this should be in the northern hemisphere I'm thinking maybe this is like very far north somewhere looking at like Northern Russia but I don't know would it be small barn I don't know how far north to look for because at some point it gets more snowy than this I think it might be somewhere up here but it's so difficult to align like to go over all of these bays and and figure out if it aligns if it doesn't align okay let's go let's go somewhere up here I don't know I don't have a better guess unfortunately let's see or it was up here yeah I was right about that but if only we could see this land we couldn't see this land so it wasn't looking here oh but okay it's still a decent score I would say I was in the right area so I'm happy about that so I'll take it I'll take it okay for a change we get a CD and this is not Coastal which could be good could be bad let's have a look what it looks um does it look European these roofs I don't know maybe something like Romania I don't know we are driving on the right side I believe yes yes Shadows are going north indeed my first thought was like yeah Romania maybe Moldova we only have a small River going through here the city looks decently sized we have a stadium without any texts these agricultural fields and then vibe in general feels very European to me and and the road lines appear to be all white what is this is that a pedestrian crossing here so it looks like we might have white and yellow on the crossing which you can see in a couple of countries like often in Russia would this be Russia I don't know I wasn't thinking of Russia but maybe the city has like a mountain to the north could wait could this be something like Sofia I know Sophia is like kind of built in inside kind of a mountain right from many sides but Sofia doesn't have yeah I think Sophia is bigger first of all and it doesn't look like Sophia has a river like that going through though Sofia doesn't work let's let's check check some of these cities like in this area Bulgaria Romania maybe Moldova Ukraine Maybe potentially would make sense with that pedestrian Crossing which might be white and yellow I feel like I've gone through all the countries I thought it could be even part of Russia but I'm not seeing anything that matches up which is not good I might just leave it in Romania since that was my first thought this looks super interesting from above I'm not sure if I've seen something like this before look the house is super tightly packed and in between they're like like Farm Fields looks very interesting where would they have it like this though yeah I feel like I've spent like more than 10 minutes looking for this place already so let's go for I don't know a random random Romanian City kind of on the western side just in case it's something else let's see it was in that area it was Ukraine I was looking in Ukraine but I did not check this city to be fair okay it is smaller than I expected it is smaller yeah again didn't find it but I was in the right area so I'll take that I'll take that I'm happy about uh kind of getting the right area at least what is this now oh no this looks tough this looks difficult again no cost really visible some Cliffs it seems so the Shadows are going north where would this be this feels like potentially Europe again potentially the road lines the center is white and we should are driving on probably our right side right side driving the house rules very similar to those previous ones we had in the last round right I think so maybe again in that area potentially some uh big apartment buildings there aren't really any like big unique features to try to find on the map they have some tiny water reservoir which is zero chance I'm finding it um I'm looking through these these Stones these cities finding some football fields some what is this some solar Farms that's interesting I was I'm thinking maybe Slovakia maybe Romania somewhere maybe maybe check here um okay let's let's see let's see it was Jackie okay not actually again not bad not bad yeah like these these small water reservoirs I don't know how I could have found it let's do the summary 16 000 points sixteen thousand points let's go for another game but I'll try to be a bit more faster because this is taking so much time let's but let's go again these Shadows are going to the north again very interesting looking soil like some Fields with trees in the middle very weird looking from above there are some houses very kind of sparesly located looks very odd from above let's have a look at that City whether we have it doesn't feel like Europe at all um I was thinking maybe something like Brazil which side are we driving on it looks like we might be driving on the right side the soil appears to be quite dark as well so you can get darks dark red soil in uh Brazil where in Brazil looks kinda dry from above at least a lot of these areas look very dry so um dry area in Brazil with with I don't know I would say maybe somewhere up here I know there are some dry patches like in this part of Brazil we should be in the northern hemisphere though I mean sun goes like like uh up and down around the equator so maybe you could maybe it could still be there but I'm not so sure anymore ah yeah yeah yeah yeah where could this be could this be Africa by any chance you have some sort of a church here I'm all over the place I don't even know the continent here I'm torn between South America Africa and Asia ah okay let's see how wrong I am again there isn't really anything to try to pinpoint here so I'll just let's just keep it somewhere up here hoping that maybe maybe that works let's see it was Africa after Ethiopia interesting interesting I had never gotten Ethiopia before in satellite view video I believe so very interesting location it looks different than I expected it to look definitely looks different than other African countries I had seen from above what this is the middle of a forest literally what a lot of smaller buildings all over the place a lot of small buildings there is a bigger city here a lot of high buildings High apartment buildings built very closely together uh I'm getting Asian Vibes very densely populated city it seems which side would we be driving here it's really difficult though but I think we are driving on the on the left side here um The Usual Suspects that come to mind are um India Bangladesh or Thailand potentially uh Indonesia Malaysia I don't know doesn't really feel like those the city is very densely populated but doesn't look big in terms of like the sheer size like medium-sized City just very dense Green Fields with some small tiny Rivers going all over the place these types of rivers I don't see like Rivers like that too much in Thailand so let's not go Thailand then so let's go kind of this area maybe and Nepal Bhutan I don't know it doesn't feel that mountainous so yeah let's go let's go here and see and it was Bangladesh yeah yeah so I was I was again in the right area pinpointing this no chance no chance but I'm I'm happy with the guess let's move on uh round number three here uh from the first glance looks very European to me something like Hungary Poland a city pretty big city the quality is pretty good sun to the north with some sort of a tower here like a yellow Tower we are driving on the right side it looks like we have some bike Lanes these red bike Lanes a lot of bike lens so could this ever be uh New Zealand because we have bike Lanes here bike Lanes here bike Lanes everywhere Everyone Gets A Bike Lane uh sorry the Netherlands not New Zealand ah the Netherlands maybe Belgium Belgium has a bunch of bike Lanes Denmark potentially what is this thing another some sort of tower there we can see more bike Lanes more bike Lanes we have a an airport here as well that could help actually decently sized they are poured with a bunch of runways wait what there is a Highway going through an airport I feel like I've seen like a video about this or something on YouTube like a Runway goes over the highway I think there might have been like a Tom Scott video about this or something but I don't remember where it was let's let's scan like like some Dutch or Belgian cities for something like this maybe we can find it yeah I don't think I can find it I don't think I can find it unfortunately ah gosh so annoying I thought I would be able to find this but but nothing fits could this be something else what else could it be with so many uh bike Lanes Arena well that's not helpful what arena ball or Red Bull Arena that doesn't help there are hundreds of Red Bull Arenas everywhere Red Bull Ari bunch of football fields Sweden could this be Sweden I don't know I really want to find this but I feel like I'm all over the place what is this thing wait BSG Kimmy like Sig is this like TIG does that work is there an air there is an airport it is Leipzig I guess they really like their bike lines in Leipzig okay I'm glad I continued looking around eventually found some some text saying like there on what seems to be an abandoned football field or at least not very well-capped football field I think this might be that uh field yeah we have the German National Library there and we would be right near the Christmas store oh how fitting Christmas is coming so we should be right there let's go let's go oh gosh speaking of Christmas at the time of when this video is live there should be a Christmas sale on my merch store with some new designs available so check it out get yourself or a friend a Geo Peter merch for Christmas what could be a better gift right okay this looks like a really really really big city really really really big city so that kind of narrows it down immediately which said are we driving on it looks like we're driving the right side interestingly enough and the Shadows are going north and we have a river going through what is this I was thinking India at first but we're driving right and this is just enormous crazy big and it looks pretty dry as well it's really interesting to see from above these districts like this might be some sort of like a like a warehouse district with kind of bigger houses with large roofs looks so different from from everything around and here as well I imagine those might be like factories or warehouses where huh I feel like this might be like a city somewhere in Africa but but but what city could it be with the river going through what are the largest cities that we can think of such a huge City the airport I imagined would be bigger looks like we only have one Runway here wait could this be like Cairo or or something no Nile looks different from above oh could this be like Sudan maybe oh it is it is okay makes perfect sense makes perfect sense so it is Nile just just more Downstream you have the bridge I think that might be the AL hilal Stadium so we would be somewhere here ish I think yeah these These are the three long buildings we have here and we would be right here than I believe let's go I just now realized I should have checked how it looks in each location also this one was a market okay so this is how it looks there where we just were well if you play along you can check it out as well the city oh this looks really really tricky very mountainous again and the city doesn't look that big we are driving on the right side all cars are white and some blue roofs I'm getting kind of I don't know Middle Eastern Vibes here something like um maybe a rock something like that I don't know if they have a in Iraq they have that many blue roofs but just by the like the all the white cars uh kind of kind of quite dry looking mountainous but Iraq would be my kind of first guests Iraq or that area Iran maybe that's also an option this is not gonna be but Baghdad would be way bigger than this way bigger than this what could Syria could this be Syria Aleppo Aleppo would be bigger surely right did we have any airports here not that I noticed but there is a river going next to the city not really through the city oh gosh um I'm looking all over the place here can't find it I'm let me get main guesses would be iron or Iraq nothing that I zoom in really aligns unfortunately okay maybe the city is smaller than I uh gonna have imagined I'm thinking maybe somewhere in this area let's see is it it was a rock it was actually a rock and that's the city oh my God it was way smaller than I had imagined and you can't even see that River yeah no zeroth chance I would have found it how did we know total 17 and a half thousand points I think a little bit better than the pre the first game if you played along let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video from above I think you will enjoy don't forget to check out the Christmas merch cell the link will be in the description and huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel as always I hope

will contain some difficult locations kind of kind of weird locations in in countries all around the world if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button and here we go let's play a Play Along video with no moving but with no time limit either so you can spend some time thinking about each location so let's go all the links will be in the description as usual oh gosh oh gosh what is this now huh something Coastal very dark soil where's the Sun so since it's all of this is official coverage we can't trust the compass sun is Sun appears to be slightly to the north which I was thinking maybe this is South Africa this is definitely an odd coverage yeah check the the map title checks out so we can expect a lot of difficult weird locations I think the average score on this map was really low as well so we'll see if I can beat the average score I don't know I don't know what this this poll is I don't recognize that one my first thought here was I mean we are coastal can we I think we might see some Coast there as well so I don't know I was thinking maybe somewhere near Cape Town somewhere uh maybe somewhere here I don't know let's see how how wrong or right am I oh my gosh Hawaii makes sense why was it the Sun to the north the sun betrayed me if the sun was to the South maybe I would have gone with Hawaii but I hate it when the sun lies oh God okay we have a lot of corn oh no oh no um the sun the sun is to the South so strictly South this time will this be Europe or will this be North America huh at first I was thinking feels kinda kinda American but I'm not so sure anymore this kind of feels with trees in the middle feel more European the houses are a bit too far to see did we have any antenna we don't have an antenna oh no we we do have an antenna which uh should be Europe then right because you don't usually see an antenna in um in North America I was thinking maybe something like um could this ever be like Slovenia a weird kind of odd Slovenia because we got to keep in mind that these locations are supposed to be kind of odd for the country that we're in I think it would be kind of an interesting Slovenia but I think Slovenia would still be possible so let's go Slovenia maybe if it's not Slovenia I think it would be in that area maybe Croatia or or something like that so let's see okay interesting I was not thinking rush I was thinking somewhere like in this this European area very close to Georgia actually wow I definitely wasn't thinking in that area there oh no very another very rural location we have an antenna So Meta Meta um and what is this a weird sign I don't know what that sign or pole is you can get this antenna in Mexico Colombia Ecuador and Brazil this is a weird pole really weird pole I don't recognize it I'm thinking maybe Ecuador maybe maybe Brazil maybe this could be Brazil maybe if you know these polls they kind of are similar to the North American ones you get in U.S and Canada but I do not see this being US and Canada at all so I guess I guess I'll go Ecuador here Splunk it in the middle because it's not like we're gonna get any clues here it was Brazil after all ah state of a map but this game is not going very well while this is official coverage okay not too many places this could be then if this is official right wait is this a Lebanon I feel like I've had this location before I'm not entirely sure where it was I can't really read those texts we have some Arabic we have some English assembly point with this be Lebanon or would this be like Pakistan maybe looks very pretty is that a coast there too foggy to tell I feel like we've had this location before with the speed Lebanon which side are we driving it looks like we're driving the right side here I don't know it's hard to see by that car blur but it looks like it's driving in the right side there um so it wouldn't be Pakistan then could this be UAE I'm torn between UAE and Lebanon this looks super fancy so maybe just because of that I'm more inclined to go with UAE they do have some really nice buildings in Lebanon as well but I mean UAE is a wealthier country I I think I'll go UAE and let's hope it's not Lebanon um I don't know where though zabil Palace maybe I don't know let's see okay it was Abu Dhabi which is definitely closer than Lebanon you don't usually get locations in Abu Dhabi so it's definitely and then it is kind of an odd one okay not not very typical location for UAE okay got a decent score at least cut the wrong City but at least the decent score oh and back to something super rural again huh something Coastal with some these small bushes could this be like I don't know Italy crossed my mind here but I don't know definitely would be a weird Italy well sun is to our South a little bit yeah I don't know maybe it's like a Greek island somewhere maybe maybe Croatia like Southern Croatia one of these islands here that's also an actual option let's go somewhere I don't know here kind of only in Italy but still close to Croatia let's see oh god oh no those canaries oh gosh oh bad around oh no how did we in Turtle we got 7791 points which is oh gosh low oh what was the average score in this map 8 000 no it was below average no okay but let's let's do another one let's do another one if you do play along uh let me know in the comments how you are doing if you manage to beat my score or not oh this is a some sort of like a like a a pathway across like some sort of a swamp or something we have like a like a pathway like this in Latvia but it looks different a lot there yeah I'm thinking would this be Europe would this be us would it be somewhere else like Asia maybe there is nothing here that would help me really I'm not a really big Flora expert I don't know where in which parts of the world these these uh like like plants grow my first thought was Europe just because like a pathway like this uh like we have some a similar one in Latvia so let's go something like maybe Poland I don't know maybe a wild guess let's go kind of in the middle of Poland somewhere there it was U.S after all ah it was U.S after all I don't think there was any way of me knowing that was there unless you recognize that oh no it was Canada it was Canada not us well very close to the Border uh these are really tricky occasions definitely one of the most difficult Maps I've played recently okay so the sun is very low Sun is setting very very long Long Shadows we can't really trust the direction if the Sun is setting Coastal obviously the very like Sandy Sandy Coast the plate isn't your opinion the plate well we're driving on the right side it seems I'm thinking us maybe again it looks like it might be an American Plate driving the right side Coast would be to our kind of North Northeast so I don't know could we be near one of these Lakes again somewhere here like Eerie I don't know that's I think that's my best guess on this one oh oh my God I mean it was on the coast it wasn't Europe but it was Brazil oh no I'm doing so bad no this feels super European from the first glance I was thinking like Denmark but let's look around um these walls do not feel Danish though these These Walls feel more kind of Welsh maybe wait what is that sign the this this yield sign is on the left side which would indicate we're driving on the left side right it looks like it might be the British yield sign potentially so whales this looks like a very typical Welsh location to me though what would be an anomaly here could this be like New Zealand now in New Zealand that the giveaway text would be red and this definitely doesn't feel like Australia to me so so it has to be UK right this will be Ireland not sure if Ireland has these yield signs with giveaway text a bunch of sheep I mean there are sheep in Wales right so yeah let's go wait is that a Scottish flag oh I almost went with whales I mean they do have sheep in Scotland as well so I guess we go Scotland because of that flag because that is a Scottish flag but an anomaly here could it be somewhere up here by any chance that would be an anomaly look like a very interesting location would it be I mean maybe should we risk it for the biscuit I mean might as well right because my score is just terrible so might as well guess somewhere here and see oh no it was just very Northern uh like Mainland Scotland what what was the anomaly there though it looked like a regular rural UK interesting but okay got at least got some decent points we have a very red Road and a black car oh this feels like it might be like in some national park or potentially or something definitely feels weird my first thought was Asia um I do not know which country though maybe like South Korea I was thinking maybe Taiwan but I don't know if Taiwan would have a car like this yeah I I I guess let's go let's go South Korea I'm not super confident about this but I just that's my best guess here let's go it was Jeju was that like a national park or a red uphill natural Recreation Forest okay okay okay so it makes sense and I'm glad I got Korea right I've almost beaten the average score all depends on this last round we have a long antenna here oh no this looks super tough this looks super tough oh no I'm not even sure this is Europe or if this is Asia um I was thinking maybe this is uh something like Taiwan or maybe this is something like Croatia or Montenegro uh I'm porn I'm torn now I I think I would go to Europe I think I would go Europe it'd be Russia maybe this could be Russia Romania let's go Romania to hedge our bets a little closer to Russia I'll still lose a lot of points if it actually is Russia though but let's go Romania oh okay Montenegro would have been a better guest there it was France oh oh gosh let's do the summary I did better than average so that's a win in my book I can let me know how you did if you played along and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this Channel and making all of it possible I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to

from above it was suggested by one of my viewers and it really sounds like an interesting concept so I thought let's play it uh so supposedly it has no Drone footage just the high buildings so let's have no time limit this time and let's maybe leave movement because in some locations you will be able to look around move around but in some it won't be possible many locations will be like this where it's a photo sphere you can't move around either way so what do we have without time pressure this is like a big waterfall is this Niagara Falls we have this big tower here Niagara Falls would be here and it might be that Toronto Tower Toronto TV tower I think there was one like a big big tower there so it might be that one like across the the the waterfall I don't know if we can trust the compass here so so I wouldn't count on that but um we would be on some sort of a view deck and across the water we have that Tower somewhere Rainbow Bridge would this be the Rainbow Bridge and Niagara Falls observation deck there is some sort of a house here I don't know if that's that house with some pathway down there so I think we might be here maybe that would be my best guess I think let's go let's go good start Good Start uh I don't expect many perfect scores on this map so so I'm very happy with that um I don't really know where this he is just going by The Vibes my first thought was Rio cons we have a big city clearly a coastal city and we have a big Green Mountains which you do see in Rio so my main guess would be there the quality is not but there's some sort of a bridge there Bridge there is there a bridge in Rio there is that bridge yeah yeah I totally forgot about that bridge there is some land across the water the bridge would be oh gosh are we somewhere here we have these little um oh gosh what do you call peers these Piers um here I don't see any piers on um that is this like uh like a lighthouse I'm not entirely sure this might be a light house where we are I I can't really align anything here could we be somewhere here maybe looking at that bridge there I'll I'll go somewhere here I don't know that's that's the best I have I think so let's go there and then hope for the best and it no wonder nothing I lied it was the opposite opposite side of the world oh it is Japan oh no I thought it was Rio I actually thought it was Rio did we have any Tech I didn't see any texts around which would have been in Japanese which would have helped oh no oh gosh after such a good first round we get this oh tricky map very tricky map what can I say but again next one the author is how is 80 in Russian yet or something uh okay so some sort of a big uh Tower sky photo box English but it looks like we might have some Cyrillic maybe or Chinese even well the author's name is is is in Russian of course but uh Sky something Cafe Sky Friends Cafe Seoul okay here we go Seoul okay one of these texts was helpful so this would be so huh they didn't see any Korean here but it's difficult to read to be fair the author's name is really tricky though but this is actually so a lot of green roofs does all have green roofs it does look like a very big city I am getting kind of Asian Vibes I would say by the architecture so I think Seoul is a good call pretty big roads meeting here well Seoul does have a lot of big roads so it's not like it's very helpful do we see the river I can't move around unfortunately is that that might be the river again we can't really trust the compost necessarily so so River might be to our East it might not be there is like a bend in the river and a bridge well Seoul has a lot of bridges as you might know as you might see I imagine this would be near a river so I guess the river would go the other side then we have some parks here and there would be like a Bend nearby okay let's go let's go somewhere here maybe let's see okay well my thoughts were kind of oh Lotte World Tower we were on apparently okay I I I didn't know that the tower existed we do have a bunch of smaller Greener parks around so um yeah makes sense makes sense I'm pretty happy with my score Seoul is a big city so um at least I recognize that oh this is a location where we can actually move around for a change okay from the first glance we notice some Japanese I believe it looks like and what does it say Sakai Temple Town I don't know where that is various cultural facilities in Dyson Park oh gosh I don't know where Dyson is well this is the most certainly Japan looks like a pretty big city Sakai it was Sakai a big city I don't see any cities with that name though so let's look for more information maybe Sakai Old Port yeah it is Sakai historical cities gateway to the Sea old Sakaya Lighthouse is is Sakai maybe a neighborhood in Tokyo or something Sakai somewhere somewhere Coastal most big cities in Japan are Coast oh Sakai here okay nice uh most of uh big cities in Japan are coastal so so that itself isn't super helpful so uh somewhere high right we had some some posts there's about a temple uh some some Temple but I mean we're not in the temple itself surely daisen Park Dai sen Temple we're not super high compared to the other other high uh like skyscrapers um so where would it be Dyson Park here we go Dyson Park we had something about Dyson Park here yeah um so it might be near Dyson Park maybe one of the buildings next to Dyson Park we have some sort of a temple here so I imagine we would be somewhere nearby um we have this like kind of big big tube building here but um don't think we'll see it here on the map um I guess let's I'll guess somewhere nearby the Dyson Park and Dyson Temple should be somewhere in this area right okay yeah pretty close oh it was Sakai it was actually Sakai City oh I saw the city hall there but I thought well probably not the city hall um but I guess it was I guess it was huh okay fair enough but still pretty good score 1.5 1.5 kilometers away okay another Coastal one oh this is almost like a Sydney Opera House here like a rip-off very similar uh similar architecture okay some pretty cool looking skyscrapers very unique design I don't recognize them though I don't think I've seen them before the author is imbran goes Imran goes okay hmm no where would this be oh wait is that a flag what flag is that oh no my flag knowledge is not the best blue red and green and something Coastal would this ever be Azerbaijan but would it does it have I guess maybe this is Caspian Sea I was thinking either about Johnny's in coastal but but it does have Caspian Sea which which technically is a lake maybe this is Baku then huh I guess I mean it would make sense actually it would make sense because this kind of architecture does feel kind of kind of I was thinking like turkey at first so Azerbaijan would make sense so can we find like like a building like this somewhere on the coast somewhere here Baku I is that the Buckle eye is this the Buckle eye giant observation wheel with city views I wouldn't exactly call it giant but I mean it is a wheel so that that that would check out shopping well is this the I was hoping to see that that shape on the map itself maybe it is located here but we don't really see it Baku panoramic view maybe you're like standing somewhere here Baku panoramic view I mean this is like a panoramic view right um so I think we might be somewhere here with water right there with the ferris wheel with a night club apparently is that the nightclub Lighthouse and Nightclub I don't know I wouldn't want to be go along this this narrow road while drunk but okay maybe it's just me uh but I think it would be yeah here ish well let's see how close my guess is okay not too bad actually lost one point we were near the flame Towers wait a minute this was misplaced because we saw those flame Towers we were not right on them they were a little bit away from us so I think my guess was right I think the photo Photosphere just misplaced a little bit unfortunate but I I think I was right let me know in the comments if I wasn't how did we do in total 19948 so that one round the the second round to Japan's interestingly enough almost the same area uh okay let's do one more let's do one more again play a long Link in the description so feel free to play along this is pretty oh no but I don't know where this would be uh the author's name is hanging pixels photo art so that doesn't help too much the quality isn't good enough we can absolutely not read anything on that sign so all we have is the beautiful nature very beautiful but I very much have absolutely no idea where this is is that water hmm no I think that's just for more Forest I don't even know the continent here I'll be honest I was thinking maybe somewhere in the US I was thinking maybe somewhere in China maybe somewhere in South America no I was thinking maybe China but I'm very much not confident um I know China can be very mountainous and and green so let's go somewhere I don't know here let's see Australia ah I was really crossed my mind for a second but then I kind of dismissed it I thought no but I guess it was I guess it was wow um it was Blue Mountains National Park huh Three Sisters walk very beautiful and not too far from Sydney as well whenever I visit Sydney in the future that's that's a place I I would love to to actually go to so yeah for sure oh some oh some some cool gym very high in the sky Life Fitness uh that's the language adjust panel that something so it's in English uh emergency phone so English I only see some English the author's name is Devin Tai I I'm thinking doesn't feel like the us or Canada I was thinking maybe the Philippines because I I think the kind of the like like uh the view feels quite Asian I would say and uh I feel in other Asian countries there would be uh like maybe some Chinese visible as well or or some other languages but we see only English here I think it could this be India which said are we driving on uh I'm between India and and and the Philippines here maybe more likely India because this looks like a really really huge City and India does have a couple of those it's hard to see on the road but it looks like we might be driving on the left side I'm very much not confident about that but I think I would go India after all now that we have a explored the city a little let's go India which city though New Delhi I guess New Delhi is like the safest bet maybe the biggest city let's see South Korea oh interesting it was Seoul again hmm I was not considering Seoul I guess we weren't driving on the left side after all and uh interesting that we had no no Korean visible as well that one threw me for a loop oh we can move around here we can move around okay so whenever I see these statues first of all were very Asian right and you can see a lot of these golden statues in like Myanmar but I think the author's name looks Thai so Thailand would make perfect sense as well the movement is very wonky and limited I'll tell you okay there are only three locations here so we can move between those very mountainous I'm thinking maybe Northern Thailand kind of near Myanmar that's kind of my thought process here a big big I believe that's a big Buddha statue right and we have a river as well that's something to do notice take note of so any rivers here we have a river here so maybe somewhere there because this area is mountainous we have a river so would make sense to be up there no but we have a Buddhist temple here so maybe this is like like a statue here not hot I don't know what it means but maybe there is like a statue in this area since there is a temple there it's kind of a long shot but I think that's my best guess on this location let's see okay it was Northern Thailand just not and it was on the border just on a different place on a different River still I'm pretty happy with my guest there you know pretty pretty good I would say pretty good A T dot a u is the author so first thought maybe Australia if if they um the author's name has a u but obviously not guaranteed the very interesting location a lot of a lot of fishies a fish tank very beautiful um again these Green Mountains in the middle of a city feels very real to me doesn't look Australian at all any language any language I'll go Rio when it's gonna be Japan again huh oh gosh or could this be Hong Kong Hong Kong also has some Green Mountains oh I'm very torn on this one very beautiful place wherever this is some sort of a new Museum wait what is this oh now that looks Chinese that looks Chinese I can't read it but it doesn't look uh Latin language alphabet so maybe it is Hong Kong after all even though it wouldn't have been my first guess if we see some Chinese [Music] and the mountains let's let's go Hong Kong because because Hong Kong does look similar for sure in terms of like the little mountains let's see let's go there and it was Japan again are you kidding me the same place oh almost the same place oh my God I guess it was Japanese look Chinese to me but it was difficult to read to be fair oh that's annoying for the second time I totally not Ricky I don't recognize Japan oh this is such a cool location wow we're on top of a big bridge but where would this big bridge be with some very interesting exits here on the bridge my first thought was could this be that that bridge um between mainland China and Macau cause um there's this very interesting unique bridge between the two places where uh the cars switch the driving side because in my car with the drive on the left in mainland China they drive on the right so I'll put on the screen how that bridge looks from above really interesting and it did have like like circles like that and it looks like we are driving on the left side here wait or could this just be Japan again could I I might be overthinking it again I mean this might just be Japan again I guess this is this should just be Japan with a lot of islands and then a bridge connecting them the author's name is estacahara takahara sounds like it could be Japanese maybe let's go Japan and uh maybe somewhere here on this bridge maybe there are so many bridges in Japan that could be really could be this bridge maybe no but this is this is this is a railroad bridge so no uh let's keep it on this bridge let's see how close are we it was that bridge what I didn't see a railroad line there are you kidding me oh my God now now this game was not good this game was not good uh 9700 points uh if you play it along let me know how you did did you manage to beat me or not there were some tricky locations here on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube

to play a map called a divisional World which contains locations on the divisions of different states districts uh Etc so that's the map we'll be playing they'll play along links as always will be in the description if you want to play along so let's set the time limit to minute and a half and no moving so good luck good luck everyone let's see what locations do we get so first thing I notice here we have short Dash is something it may be Sweden let's look around we have the long antenna the the houses yeah the houses are this this dark red color does feel quite Nordic to me so in combination with that I would go Sweden I could yeah I was about to say I could see this being Estonia but not with these male boxes you don't really see mailboxes like that in Estonia so I would go Sweden here um doesn't feel too Northern to me um so yeah so so these locations are somewhere on these these like dashed lines the divisions so there are a lot of a lot of kind of Divisions in Swede and it seems so let's go somewhere down here um I don't think there's a point of trying to pinpoint this location okay it was Sweden just a little bit more North but I think that's a pretty good guess to start it off with 4.6 000 um we okay another nordics we have this um yellow sign with a red around Long antenna um this oh gosh is this sweet and again or is this Finland these these are not white Road lines on the sides right I think in Finland the red border would be thicker I think that's that's what I was thinking so I'm thinking this would be Sweden again we get these darker um dark red houses kind of some yellow houses that's all you can see in nordics um I would say Sweden maybe a bit more north than the previous one that's kind of my thinking on this one again not many not like any city names nothing to to try to find so just going by The Vibes uh maybe somewhere yeah like um summer here I don't know let's see okay okay it was not as North as I thought I think it was a little bit more north than the previous one but I thought it would be a bit more North but still um pretty good score double Sweden starting off with double Sweden okay this is not Sweden for sure this would be Japan with these um black and yellow stripes on the poles do we see any stay so these stays or guy wires um these these stripy ones I think you get in the northern part of Japan so either Hokkaido or northern part here so that's where I I believe if I remember correctly I was studying them one day on stream um so yeah that's that's that so just because of those do we see any cabbages or cabbages um not really no cabbages around so I think I'll go somewhere like here maybe Yama got somewhere on this this border here between the um provinces oh wow okay um I guess I need to study those guy wires some more damn I I really thought those those black and yellow stripes were Northern huh okay so this looks very American also we have these divided Windows which you see a little bit more in America than uh in Canada from my experience um something County Lena Lenawee County I have no idea where that is Lenawee County South okay what is this shape this is a state shape but what state is this um uh [Music] it's it's not Ohio is it is it no yeah no maybe is it Ohio maybe I'm not convinced is it kinetic it's not Connecticut I think Ohio's shape matches the best um I think I'm not gonna be Pennsylvania hmm yeah I mean we don't have much time so let's go Ohio it was it was border of Ohio yeah I just didn't know which border to go so it just went kind of in the middle okay okay not too bad I at least at least I've found the uh State the shape felt a little bit off but maybe they kind of stylized it for it to look prettier all Garvey Algarve is that the um City so we have Portuguese plate I was thinking that this also looks kind of like a Portuguese uh speed speed limit sign so is it e e 81 A2 e81 A2 where is eight where is Algarve first of all algor ever I feel like I've heard of Olive Garden before but I don't see it we should be near a border a2a 13 a 23 A4 oh gosh A2 is here A2 A2 a13 a2a 13 meet somewhere here so let's go somewhere there okay close enough close enough okay Algarve is the Portugal southernmost region apparently I knew I've heard of the name somewhere just couldn't see it on the map so 21 800 points for the first game not bad let's go for another one again links uh of course in the description if you want to play along uh let's see and of course let me know how you do in the comments do you beat me do you not beat me and press that like button if you enjoy these play along videos it really helps the channel um okay where would this be now this looks no definitely European um I wish I could read that sign the language looks like we have some grapes on that sign so somewhere where they make wine well they make wine in a lot of countries might not be super popular and some but still I feel like in every country you can find like a winery somewhere and he Rifts in the sky now um I was thinking it feels like kind of Bulgaria Maybe I wish I could read that a lot of those levels at least see if it's Cyrillic or not just by The Vibes the the roads and I don't know the nature around I was thinking maybe Bulgaria Romania somewhere there that's that maybe Serbia somewhere but we did have an antenna right yeah we did we have an antenna and Serbia most of the time you don't get an antenna so I would I would go Bulgaria maybe Romania and that that would be my guess it was oh Croatia oof okay I was I was off could be worse Croatia was a possibility but but builtmore Eastern but oh well oh well that was a tricky round for me at least um looks like we're driving the left side yellow uh back plate there so it looks like we have the slow camera again uh with because of the the that yellow play confused me for a second I was thinking maybe Hong Kong but I think we have the lower camera the guardrail feels very low and these things I'm not sure if I've seen them in Hong Kong before definitely in Japan so I would say Japan here again these guy wires again these little Stripes I think I'll go north again because of those little stripes on the guy wires but um is it 82 or something these These are Regional roads so um there isn't much use uh trying to find them but but but I would go up here let's see okay you've got that it was the same area as the previous time here's the research I was using share generously by cine Monique and I totally forgot that these little stripes are here as well I thought it's only the northern part of this one but yeah apparently it's down here and both of the times that was the location here but okay now I know now I remember that they can be down here as well for four uh so those those guy wires as I said I'm still still studying and still practicing them but that can be really helpful in Japan uh if you if you know them and uh oh yeah yeah yeah not much information here just the generation 4 camera uh well we would be in Europe but which country now would this be something like Bulgaria maybe or Romania or um or I don't know Hungary maybe for some reason Bulgaria is calling my name again for some reason Bulgaria is calling my name could this ever be Greece uh maybe Northern Greece but but I would go yeah maybe Bulgaria again I don't know why Bulgaria is calling my name today all the time well Romania was a possibility too um Bulgaria and Romania can look very similar to each other they can be difficult to tell apart if you don't see any languages oh is probably like the area is that how you say it should be uh Spain is this like Catalonia this this flag kind of reminds me of of the flag Zara goes oh wait Zara goes away oh God which which was Zaragoza here is Zaragoza yeah okay so we have a province of Zara Gaza so we are near Zaragoza we we are entering the Zaragoza Province to our South East so where does this Zaragoza Province start or end Aragon it did say Aragon here right yeah Oregon Jose Tiana where is Jose Tiana uh we very little time you don't see hasetiana might be very small or I might just might just be missing things as I usually do yeah I did not see it um no it's not even on Jose Tiana isn't even on the map but still I'm very happy with my guess here it was Spain it was almost exactly where I guessed pretty good pretty good um what do we see so uh yellow middle lines a US flag is this a border is that oh it's also a U.S flag right so this is some sort of a dam some sort of a dumb I don't think that's a Canadian flag so this would be somewhere in the US we don't have a front plate what is this oh oh oh Chicago oh Chicago okay Chicago I know where Chicago is oh oh this does it say oh no maybe just zero low or something um I'm not sure if Olo is a place or a neighborhood or or something I I don't know where where is there a dam here somewhere here maybe there might be a damn cooling like no it does say Chicago there so I'm gonna assume it's somewhere near Chicago because it did feel like Northern us why did it say Chicago can any Americans in the in the in the comments please explain why did it say Chicago there had this this stolen the manhole cover from Chicago or what that doesn't say Chicago anywhere here oh my God I was I was expecting a good score and I mean it's not terrible but uh okay let's do the summary uh 18 500 points not as good as the first game but uh let's try to perform in the third one third one the charm maybe so we have Japan again any uh any guy wires or or stays nearby not that we can see so we can't can't rely on those yeah I don't really have a good guess so looks like we have a city down there to our uh North West so I would go maybe somewhere here like maybe it's Nagoya just just a guess they don't really know this oh it was okay it was Osaka not Nagoya so not too bad we're getting a lot of like uh Japanese locations in this this area in particular in this this these games much is the coincidence okay we have a blue sign with red text on it no this looks like a French um the the road marker no one we have French bollards here as well so this would be France feels like northern France to me I would say can't read anything at all they're all numbers wouldn't be helpful in France because uh the road numbering system is all over the place there so just going by The Vibes I would go more North because when you don't have any texts any other Clues just you have to go by The Vibes and uh let's see if my vibes are on spot or not so I would go maybe somewhere here near Nancy somewhere there may I could see this being maybe Western as well Northwest but I'll go north east hey my vibes are pretty good in this round at least pretty good even more North very close to the Belgian border okay I'm happy with that guess a South Carolina state line okay good start Good Start South Carolina so we go to South Carolina state line South Carolina does it mean we enter South Carolina or we exit South Carolina Chesterfield County Adopt A Highway oh yeah yeah we are either entering or exiting South Carolina uh 207 um I don't recognize this design um so South Carolina where is the state line so we have a river here between Georgia and South Carolina so maybe this is this state line then 207 207.000 207 Chesterfield County does it doesn't say I would go like here then does it align I think it aligns yeah I think we are there let's go let's go a 5k always makes the good 5Ks oh no this looks more tricky edgy edgy guard rails all white Road lines white chevrons are those bollards gosh what is this I'm confused where's the sun the sun is to the South I was thinking maybe turkey but does turkey have edgy guard rails I was thinking the ballards look kind of Turkish in the landscape also I could see it's being Turkish landscape that sign blue sign you can get blue signs in Turkey I think I don't know about the guard rails but what else could this be what else could this really be no way this is like Italy no no chance this wouldn't be us Chile Chile doesn't have guardrails like these and the Sun is to the South as well I'll go I'll go turkey I'll go turkey but but um it was Turkey I was nervous there uh about it being turkey I guess yeah it could have gone more East but I'm just happy about getting the country itself right but but yeah nothing else really came to my mind what else could it be so turkey made the most sense now this feels like the UK doesn't it the house um feels very very very British we have these stone walls which which country in UK do you get the most stone walls Scotland maybe this does feel like it could be Northern or wait uh stone walls oftentimes you get on Islands so I'm thinking maybe this actually could be Isle of Man because I know like whenever you get stone walls quite often those could be islands like Jeju for example in South Korea you get stone walls a lot I am thinking this might be Isle of Man actually with generation 2 feeling British because I love man I have mixed up Isle of Man in Scotland before they they can look quite similar so the more I think about it the more I am liking Isle of Man guess here but is are there any borders there on Isle of Man wait there are no borders there the the whole map is divisions there are no divisions on the Isle of Man are there okay I'm switching I'm switching to Scotland last second oh it was Ireland after all I thought the house looked so British oh no okay it was Ireland damn I really thought it was UK there I I love man would have been a closer I guess was there something that gave Ireland away I wasn't sure but okay 3 800 points uh in total 21 000 again around the same score as the first game if you played along let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this Channel and making me doing this full time possible I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path":

another geoguessr Play Along video and in this one we are gonna play completely random geographer Maps I think many people might not know this but by following this URL on screen you will get a completely random map on geoguesser so I'll be using it to find some maps to play in this video the only thing I'll do is that I'll be playing what appear to be global maps so no rural ohios or or north macedonias or anything specific like that so let's get going let's no Hanover let's try to find something that appears to be Global observatories of the world so that will be the first map that we are playing the play along links will be in the description no moving and the time limit let's say one minute good luck everyone so observative observatories of the world okay we have a big satellite dish what is what is this language open cameras van cameras comras is cameras a place Astron this is official coverage looking at the language I'm thinking maybe something like the Netherlands uh I'm not sure if it's Dutch or not I I think the language looks kind of Dutch it's definitely not German I can tell you that much but it uh if I had to guess I would go gotcha so let's go the Netherlands maybe maybe maybe kind of Northern Belgium as well somewhere kind of Southern Netherlands I would go maybe calm is cameras a place maybe you can find it we have a few seconds remaining I don't see comras but okay let's let's keep it somewhere here okay it was it was the Netherlands just just not Southern Netherlands [Music] okay cameras wasn't the place if you speak Dutch what is Congress let me know in the comments okay we have some the author's name is some some Japanese so would this be Japan let's have a look around a more huge satellite dishes a lot of big satellite dishes here oh a very mountainous so definitely could be Japan Japan as you know is very mountainous oh we I think we do have some probably Japanese if we didn't have the author's name I would say maybe Chinese but I'm assuming it's it's probably Japanese um how how Southern does this look I'm not sure it's hard to tell for me I would go kind of central Maybe Kinda not far from Mount Fuji maybe a bit more North somewhere here this National Park Maybe okay actually not bad actually not bad okay Mount Fuji would have been closer it was Mount Yoko Mount Yoko but okay not not too far either Scott Kennedy is the author of this one we have a a hat a coconut like a cowboy style hat would this be the us or would this be oh gosh the quality is too bad for us to read what it says it could be any language I I I can't read a single symbol there and we can't just a compass because it's unofficial it's a it's a photo sphere is this us is this Australia maybe what is this 18 seconds remaining oh no for some reason I wanted to go like Australia in New Zealand but but oh God nine seconds ah let's go let's go uh let's go us let's go US ah I'm switching back to U.S Colorado okay it was us I'm glad I switched it back oh very close to Los Angeles actually okay Mount Wilson Mount Wilson Observatory okay actually doing pretty okay lost a lot of points in that last round but at least I didn't go Australia there oh this is an interesting average this is official and we see a hand huh I don't think I've seen this coverage before even though it's official we don't have a we don't see a satellite dish this time it looks like we might have some Chinese there could this ever be Hong Kong rural Hong Kong Maybe very not sure um I think I might be very wrong here but it was just the US this time our Arizona huh oh gosh I thought I saw some Chinese one on that sign I guess it wasn't Chinese huh I guess it was not Chinese there can we get a bit closer oh yeah it was not Chinese and we have one more round remaining okay here we go another big Observatory again with no satellite dishes we have red reflectors on these guard rails this feels quite American to me but the central line is white would this ever be Chile where's the sun the sun is to the north yeah so I guess I would go Chile I'm not sure though those white Central lines would make sense in Chile I guess and the nature definitely looks like it could be Chile or maybe kind of Northern Argentina maybe even let's go kind of here ish and she like okay A bit more south but it was Chile a pretty good score I would say how did I do in total 14 000 points that the fourth round kind of screwed me over there I could have had a much better score but yeah well let's keep going let's keep going so let's keep going around the map again not this one Southern Maine no nope okay I think this is um Global nautical fun pirate ships Jolie Roger Flags fairies shipwrecks anchors and anything Pirates sailor and sea related okay good luck the link again in the description okay we have a lighthouse and a big black blob author is Stefan Hawke Stefan Hawk oh that's a windsock I thought that was a flag at first a Canadian flag but no um oh gosh my my regular viewers already know that I do not like Coastal locations in geoguesser so this map I'm not excited for where would this be the houses feel European I would say could this be like could this ever be like Belgium or or or or Germany Maybe or Poland I don't know it feels kind of kind of like uh the Baltic Sea Coast somewhere here maybe let's go Poland could this be the Dina or Gdansk it was oh it actually was Germany okay well it was one of my guesses as I mentioned I thought it might be Germany so not bad switch to Poland unfortunately but still a good guess I would say Julian Mason is the author here now this feels quite British British to me do we have any language map of something something will be Welby it is English it is in English that's science so where would this be doesn't feel very Northern and doesn't feel Scottish to me um is there like a will be or something a place with that name because I thought that science says something like will be or something along those lines I don't see any will bees here though so it might not be a place name let's go I guess let's let's go somewhere here all the way up here oh here it was with B with B oh that was a pretty small place name if I had more time I guess I could have zoomed in more and then found it but still could have been better could have been worse uh Martin Mitchell micholic micholic a lot of Flags Okay that's a French flag why is red on the left side um okay beware of jet blast props and rotors is that supposed to be a French flag or no I'm I'm confused something Bridge does it say Bridge we have a lot of English here and and of course English on the ship as well I have absolutely no idea looking at the houses um I don't know I genuinely don't know would this be U.S somewhere maybe um let's go I don't know um or the other side of us well it was Coastal USA just chose the wrong Coast unfortunately that that's a lot of points lost there uh it was San Diego huh oh if only I had gone to twitchcon in San Diego I would have probably recognized it oh if only if only but okay at least I'm happy I got the country right again that's that's important to find something to to be happy about right we have are those pounds those are pounds uh so possibly you you came Steward Edmond stone is the author Stuart Edmund Stone extra large sized semi-precious gemstones oh they look pretty and pretty cheap um anyways I love brixham where is brixham where do people love brixham I wouldn't know where to look for Brick's ham but uh we have 10 seconds to find it yeah probably not gonna find Brick's Hammond this time but well I guess we'll find out all the way down here oh there is brixham yep there it is oh I guess we are playing the coastal world so I guess makes no sense to guess in Oxford at least it wasn't too far away okay let's keep going last round of this map Ben the author is Ben short and simple oh and this is like a very kind of typical coastal location uh go figure where the nature feels European to me I was thinking maybe something like uh bronze maybe UK again well or maybe I'm very wrong that's also possible when my first thought was France here okay with that house maybe something like Ireland those are that's a very typical Irish looking house although you can get houses like that in both UK and France as well but with that house let's actually go kind of eastern island Eastern Ireland Maybe no so I have a sneaky suspicions it might be UK so France would be my third guest at this point but yeah I feel like it's somewhere in this area somewhere here let's see okay it was it was UK after all yeah Southern UK so so how how did we do in total 16 000 points again one round that's that's way worse than all the others the US one because the wrong side unfortunately but okay let's keep going random geoguessr map uh not this one nope nope Melbourne Ashton no three points no it sometimes takes a while to find a proper map European airports I guess let's try European airport sure sure not really worldwide but still not country specific so that's good so I can link in the description I haven't traveled too much in the airport wait Oslo Oslo Airport avenor Oslo Airport okay where I know where Oslo is where is the airport in in up in here where is the airport how Central would it be how difficult is it to find an airport oh come on where is the freaking airport I I can't find the airport y'all what all the way there oh my gosh it's further away from the city than I thought actually well and it threw me off a little bit and we have a broken coverage oh that's that's just lovely that's just lovely well we know it's in somewhere in Europe oh let's go I don't know Brussels where is there an airport here here Brussels Airport let's go there it was UK stunts that I've even been to Stansted if we if it wasn't broken maybe I could have recognized it but yeah unfortunately it was broken now what is this Paris Paris airport best of sports well I guess we go to Paris where is the airport in Paris here so the goal the goal airport is one of the biggest in Europe right one of the busiest I'm not sure if this is the the goal airport or not because I'm guessing there are probably other airports so here is another airport De Paris or Lee maybe it's this one Paris airport maybe let's go this one will be spicy there maybe let's see oh it was this one oh let's go let's go got the right one uh fourth round Istanbul is in the in the uh author's name so this might be Istanbul Global exchange this does look like a very big airport so I could see it being a big city like Istanbul so where where in Istanbul is there an airport next oh we have it up all the way up in here very big looking airport yeah let's go somewhere there okay good good good good good and the last round I don't know what language is ustita my life powered us we have some some okay a lot of different language Milano okay Milan then um I guess is Italian we do have a lot of words ending with I so it might be Italy then oh where is the airport near Milan oh gosh that is that a Milano airport yeah I gotta look kind of more outside the cities because quite often apparently the the airports are really really outside the city let's view the summary pretty good all in all pretty good the second round unfortunately was broken For Me Maybe it's not broken for you if you play along sometimes for some people it is broken from for others it isn't but okay let's do one more uh one more game public toilets of the world now this sounds like a good map I've even played it before so let's get going let's go public toilets of the world oh oh this is such a funny funny place is this like an art exhibition or something toilet the old toilets with flour is growing out of them now this would be U.S probably right a North 56 11. oh we have some yellow um license plates this yellow color it feels very New York to me 56 11 56 11 in New York 11. or is 56 can I find 56 I don't see 56 51 I was all the way up there oh there there there there yeah there is 11 56 yeah here it is we were in Potsdam a dbca service vehicle parking yeah that's the there's the public toilet I don't know what dbca stands for something CA maybe Canada although this doesn't look like Canada now that I look at the landscape feels more like a southern us or something all white Road lines though wait which side are we driving on we're driving wait are we driving on wait a minute which set are we driving on it looks like we're driving on the left side here now are we wait I'm confused which side are we driving on where's the steering wheel I don't see it oh gosh oh no oh no oh no oh okay I'll go I'll go I'll go ah somewhere either one no we were driving on the left side no oh gosh darn it it was near Perth it was Canal rocks Canal Rocks public toilet oh that's annoying that I couldn't see those steering wheel sides oh okay that's that's the public toilet this time doesn't look as fancy as that previous one where would this be a reserved park now the signs look quite American to me I would say stop yup yup we have a American flag we have a Texan flag so this is the good old Texas somewhere there no clue which city it might be so I guess we just go somewhere Austin maybe it's kind of semi-central in Texas let's go Austin yeah it was Houston okay toilet free toilet okay Atlantis to fun um what what's the language this feels like a Latin America probably maybe not Latin America wait are those are these Indonesian license plates wait I'm so confused where is this I'm s what the look like looks like an Indonesian license plate there I'm really confused here Gratis why would why would it say Gratis in Indonesia we do have front plates don't we this is Indonesia I'm guessing Jakarta then there's some sort of uh like amusement park it seems let's go Jakarta it was Jakarta that was a confusing round yeah some some fantasy land okay and Stewart's car pets a lot of English Old Ham Metropolitan Borough old time if only when you were Old Ham is that would be helpful oh well this yeah this is you UK as suspected but Oldham UK 0161 I think it might be somewhere down here I think London was like zero one two or something or zero two one or something like that Old Ham do we see any Old Ham somewhere here nearby I I don't see Oldham I don't see Oldham anywhere here maybe it's more North uh it was near Manchester oh yeah here is Old Ham actually pretty large now that you zoom in 17.6 000 points in total again I had one round where I completely failed so if you played along you definitely had the chance to beat me let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks all of the patrons and YouTube members who are supporting this Channel and allowing me to do this all full time I hope I'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind

we are gonna play a spooky map we'll be playing a map called spooky and scary locations across the world so we'll see let's try not to get scared and let's do one minute and a half per game if you play along the links are in the description as always let's get going okay this does look kind of like like a spooky house I wonder if it's like haunted or just looks spooky I'm not sure if these locations have some sort of backstory or they just look kinda kinda Pokey uh and by the way of course press that like button if you enjoy these play along videos it really helps out the channel when you do so we do have front plates and of course this is North America I would think that this is us with these brick houses I would think uh kind of Northeast U.S because I feel like you usually get those in a Northeast area I don't know the plates maybe plates could help but but I don't know them there's so many plates to study that it's it's such a daunting task that I have never gotten to it I'm thinking maybe something like Massachusetts I don't know main maybe yeah I think it would be somewhere in that area let's hope it actually is U.S because there is an off chance this might be Canada but I would I would say somewhere here okay not bad actually was it main it was actually Maine okay so it was even more Northeast but I'm very happy with my guess I did consider Maine so I'm happy about that oh interesting oh I probably should have looked at what that location was I'll have a look uh after the after the uh all five locations what is this some sort of a bunker Bonkers are always very interesting to visit I've been in like maybe two bunkers in my life now where would this be though I can't really read the language at all the nature and everything feels quite European I was thinking maybe even Lithuania or pole and somewhere there I don't think this would be Latvia I I I've never seen or heard this place in Latvia so but but it feels similar so yeah I'm thinking maybe maybe a neighboring country somewhere here um yeah I wish I could read those signs but but okay let's go let's go Lithuania I think oh gosh I hope it's not like us or something because I could I could maybe see this being no no it feels much more European to me than the North American uh let's go let's go somewhere kind of Southern Southern uh Lithuania Maybe it actually was us I thought that house that we had looked super European I guess it was George what was that place Earth Lodge Mounds what is that according to Google these Okmulgee mounts were considered sacred and people that pilgrimages here okay okay would be interesting to to see how they look inside I mean maybe if I find I'll leave a picture on on screen oh no how they look inside that could be interesting now this would be Japan what wait what was scary here that the person is scary is that a real person or is that a scarecrow I think it's a real person right what are they doing there I think that's a real person right what was scary here what did I miss what's scary maybe something scary happened here that also might be the case wait what's here no for sure oh okay okay this is creepy these are scarecrows oh my God this is such a realistic scarecrow oh my God if I was a crow you got me I I thought that there was a real person there but these are for shorts characters you can see that they have no faces wow this is such a cool very realistic scarecrows I didn't didn't understand what's creepy at first surely that's a real person at that table right can you imagine they were also scarecrows everyone's scarecrow here oh okay we're running out of time where in Japan would we be um I I don't know this doesn't feel too Northern but it doesn't feel very Southern either so I guess I'll just go middle that's that's my reasoning uh well let's see okay it was more Southern than I expected not super Southern but but still okay let's go next round I I enjoyed that location that those scarecrows oh this is interesting some some okay this is spooky for sure some like an old old cart old carts okay random Soldier what is this oh oh what could this ever be near like um near um Chernobyl maybe somewhere in that area just a wild guess it might be just just uh just anywhere else really this feels European this feels European for sure is there anything there might be a flag on that uniform no way that's a lot is that a Latvian flag I think it might be a Latvian flag this looks like kind of like it might be a Latvian uniform I don't know where though would like that we have this longer antenna oh gosh I'm this isn't the last video is it no it isn't no the uniform looks Latvian though with the the flag I'm so conflicted here fine I'll go Latvia I have no idea where in Latvia would this be but fine just because of that uniform it was Chernobyl damn it it actually was Chernobyl and kind of disappointed in myself now I thought it might be 10 a billion then I allowed that that uniform to trick me yeah there is the ferris wheel would be really really fascinating to visit it because I've seen some some people going there some places are allowed some aren't I think would be a very very fascinating um travel destination for sure now what would this be this sign felt very kind of Dodge at first let's have a look okay maybe not the Dodge with that white um with that white uh license plate this would be Belgium we have this orange pole you can get these Sands in Belgium as well except usually they have orange poles and this this poll also feels very Belgium this kind of um square square pole with holes what What's creepy here what's spooky here I guess I guess this abandoned house is spooky I guess all abandoned houses are a bit spooky maybe this one has some some additional history behind not sure about that uh this might be kind of near Coast based on these um Hills because I know around Hills at least in the Netherlands they have these kind of bigger walls built maybe just just a random Hill as well of course um let's go let's go Belgium let's go Belgium kind of near Coast kind of risky but but let's let's risk it for the biscuit so to speak let's see is it Coastal oh a new badge ghosts and stuff congrats you are spooky uh why did I get this badge I'm not sure what because of playing this map or I'm not sure okay it was Antwerp it was so yeah it was Belgium it was Coastal uh so pretty good pretty good pretty good let's go 15 000 points fifteen thousand points let's go for another one again Link in the description Good Luck Good Luck oh wait wait wait wait wait I'll I'll continue that in a second I did say I'm gonna check out the first location didn't I so let's have a look uh just a random house I guess nothing shows up on the map okay fair enough let's continue then I guess okay this looks like an abandoned Factory oh big mountains around uh for my first thought was like Canada uh Canada uh like British Columbia maybe or or could this be Alaska would a lot does Alaska have Generation 4 coverage I always forget do we have any plates do we have any license plate to visible um not really not really a boat Hydro lightning so like uh British Columbia Alaska would make sense with mountains and a boat I'd still probably go British Columbia very cool looking abandoned building I always think that it would be so so cool uh to to kind of explore these abandoned buildings but they must be um dangerous yeah no trespassing they're always off limits but still would be really cool um yeah I I think I'll go British Columbia I wish we could see some plates to to kind of help us with with um deciding but but it looks like this road might not be paved which would make me lean more towards Canada as well let's go somewhere yeah like like this area not too far it was Alaska ah after all it was Alaska Wittier Whittier okay so lost the coin flip there unfortunately but okay let's move on oh that's a green license plate so Philippines maybe with this um concrete block road as well definitely feels Asian the tree is the the whole vibe feels very Asian and with the green play and green plate would confirm that you can get kind of greenish plates in the Philippines and yeah in English no smoking text so yeah this this I'm pretty sure this would be the Philippines looks like an looks like another abandoned building so it doesn't look like a factory this time maybe an old school old schools are creepy abandoned schools I think I I think I would go more Northern Philippines Maybe that's too North though somewhere here maybe not not I'm not very sure though but okay let's let's see uh okay a little bit more North but I was in the right area I'm happy about that 98 kilometers away okay what is this now okay now that is scary and creepy for sure we see some maybe Chinese symbols in the background what song was song definitely getting big Asian Vibes but where would it be would this be in China because I know China does have some limited coverage in like Beijing Shanghai and some some other places Hua song is in the city is it I don't think so what song probably means like look something like festival or something yeah I don't know where we have palm trees so let's go maybe Shanghai although with palm trees maybe more south like like Guangzhou xiamen I don't know I don't know exactly which cities might have coverage or not I just know there is some yeah let's go let's go kind of South here Singapore ha English it didn't look like Singapore to me I'll be honest didn't look like Singapore to me I mean it makes sense but so this was harpar Villa Park artfully depicting Chinese history because I told you it looks Chinese so you can't blame me for going China here it's a park supposed to look like China so um yeah that the palm tree threw me off the the palm tree doesn't make more sense in Singapore I'll give you that for sure yeah but um I I thought it was a good guess about me I guess not oh that's a lonely house is this Iceland it feels like Iceland we have a long antenna very few trees some some bare mountains um I think this would be in Reykjavik no I think let's let's see let's go Reykjavik somewhere here maybe we have some some Coast there visible though so would we be somewhere here then we have uh no we have like a roundabout to our South any roundabouts here no I guess this might not be the place after all somewhere here no I think I'll just remain somewhere here hope for the best it was up there huh I I thought it didn't align because we didn't see like much of but there are some islands but it felt like like a more prominent land across the water and we do have some some roundabouts there okay fair enough fair enough still pretty good guess I would say oh I know this and this is the um I don't know how it's called an English mountain of crosses in Lithuania I haven't actually been here I've driven past it a couple of times now where was it where was it was it somewhere oh I don't remember where exactly it was I think we saw it trying to show a lie krishio calmness it might be that one Grigio calmness place of pilgrimage with hundred thousand crosses yes yes that's the one that's the one I thought it was on on the way to xiaolai from Latvian so I guess we guess right on top of it very fascinating place I'd love to actually actually visit it instead of going past it definitely I'll kind of gonna give gives you an eerie Vibe that's for sure right for Halloween do you celebrate Halloween let me know in the comments actually because in Latvia it's not really a big thing children sometimes goes from house to house but uh but it's not not super common yeah let's let's get somewhere here oh yeah what was was in that area perfect score how did we do 16 000 points uh I'm very happy I recognized that last round at least one perfect score let me know in comments how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I really appreciate it I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/trsWyiuccO4Uto7r", "data/images_geopeter/SAP9NAc4fqcRNTw3"], "locations": [[{"round": 1,

play some Corning locations around the world the map that we're gonna be playing is called an amazing world of corn made by an amazing content creator called cinemonica leave a link to his channel in the description go and check him out the play along links will be in the description as well if you want to play along and let's go good luck everyone what do we have well as as the title suggests um all the locations will contain corn but the location selection is really good locations are all official all around the world just the way that that I like it the maps for the maps to be and we have some doggos as well apparently which which is always a nice a nice bonus these polls these these polls uh look very much like Chilean poles to me with these kind of triangular poles with no horizontal dividing sections all white Road lines white Google car mountains all good signs this might be Chile by the way if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button as well it really supports the channel and I do appreciate it so in Chile so where would this be this looks kind of greenish actually might even be south of Santiago maybe not too much maybe something like taika I don't know my guess would be maybe somewhere there oh wow it was a bit north of Santiago okay I mean it wasn't too far but okay lost a thousand points there rectory Farm what is that what does rectory mean I'll be honest I'm not sure English isn't my first language as you probably know a yellow back plate yellow well yellow backlights right on the left side this would be UK also we have these bollards you get in UK and interestingly enough in Indonesia I don't know why those two countries in particular but those two countries have these types of bollards I wouldn't go too far north here just by The Vibes general feeling let's go here not bad not bad okay let's keep going let's keep going what does this feel like are we driving on the left side here we are driving the left side what first I was thinking this would be South America but not with the driving in the left side with this B Thai uh Thailand I think this would we tell and with these Square poles with holes reddish soil um we don't see any language to verify and here of course here is the corn well I don't point out the corn every time but there is corn in every location so if you're a big fan of corn you can maybe try to tell the types of corn apart or something let's get somewhere uh I don't know here ish not bad not bad okay so doing pretty good actually what is next we have these bollards usually you get this red more red reflector in Slovenian and in Austria usually they are darker but I think this would be Austria this time based on this sign I think this directional sign feels very Austrian to me I think and oh and we have the domain okay we have the domain name as well these these Austrian boards are really interesting is this little little thingy on top in Winter you can pull it out and it becomes a snow pole so if it's snowy look it pulls out and then I'll leave a picture on on the screen looks really interesting so that's a fun fun Bowl art fact for you a very mountainous looking so possibly more Western I don't think we could see anything on that sign right yeah it's a bit too far to see but let's get somewhere here ish it's it's quite hilly there okay A bit more south but still a good score good score now would this be Indonesia or Malaysia do we have front plates on the motorcycles I think we do where in Indonesia would this be because in India these you get front plates and motorcycles in Malaysia you don't um these roofs you get you can get these kind of Crossing beams in south sulawesi but I have seen those in Sumatra as well so which one would it be and these these polls remind me of kalimantan which is like there is like this area so I'm gonna very torn here very torn here I think I would go still South sulawesi and uh we have some hills I mean most of most of Indonesia is hilly so doesn't help too much it was kalimantan I knew those poles felt like kalimantan uh very very very North okay that makes sense let's view the summary how did we do a 19.6 000 points for the first game piece and decent Coulda could have been better but uh still pretty happy with the score if you play along let me know in the comments as always I always like to read your comments did you manage to beat me did you not manage to beat me let me know it's always interesting to read we don't have the front plates here and I think that looks like an albertan Bollard there so yeah um Alberta didn't have front plates right BC had front lights for to remember front plates in Canada you can remember one four five seven the the numbers so the one being British Columbia has a front plate or is Manitoba in like an order one two three four fourth is Manitoba fifth is Ontario and seventh is New Brunswick so those are the provinces that do have front plates other ones don't that's a way to remember uh which which ones have or don't have front plates in uh Canada so let's guess Alberta because of that Bollard uh maybe a bit more west-ish closer to the hills a lot more North oh very close to Edmonton okay okay now this would be Lesotho right has to be with these very very Rocky Mountains with very few trees yeah this has to be pretty much Lesotho with a white car as well driving on the left side as indicated by this Arrow Arrow basically means you you need to get back to that side no more overtaking happening here so let's go to Lesotho let's go let's go um oh gosh this looks tricky this looks like the us and we have some green houses I first thought was somewhere North East Northeastern U.S maybe our kids Farm speed limit 25 so yeah speed limit would indicate us no as I suspected but it doesn't help to narrow it down really okay let's go let's go sweet corn Tomatoes good old corn let's go maybe a Pennsylvania maybe Northern Pennsylvania okay A bit more East it was Northeast U.S I feel like Northeast U.S quite often has that got very unique feeling about it I don't know in a very green a lot of trees and hills from time to time and hard to describe but it was a pretty good guess I'm happy with that Buffet Terrace dot 80 is is this Austria or this doesn't it looks like Austria it might be an Austrian sign I'm not sure lots of corn but unfortunately we are too far to see either of those signs properly I think it may be says Graz because it's a short word but uh that's just just a guess gross grass would be to our East Northeast so let's go here-ish I guess it did say Graz it was even closer to Grass than I thought okay pretty good pretty good uh round number five oh gosh there really isn't much to go by here White Road lines antenna sun is Tau feels kind of balkan-ish um I do I'm not sure which country though I'm kind of leaning maybe Bulgaria maybe maybe Romania maybe I feel somewhere there let's go Bulgaria kind of Western Bulgaria in case it's something else but let's see it was oh it was Bulgaria very close to the Romanian border so how did we do in total okay this is a better score 21.8 thousand also pretty good again how will we do in the third game let's do another one let's see um okay we have a sign with no borders um you get signs with no borders in Spain but this is a French poll this isn't a typical French sign that's for sure but in France you quite often do see kind of uh lower signs to the ground and this one is quite low to the ground oh no but this this is a Spanish no hunting sign this is a Spanish no hunting Sun so this is Spain after all okay so this is a Spanish sign then with no borders interesting okay so hmm I guess you can get these tops sometimes in Spain as well I would guess Northern Spain then I would guess Northern Spain where does it look so green in Spain it really looks like France so that's why I'm thinking it might be maybe somewhere up up here near France let's see oh it was all the way there West okay fair enough fair enough it was Spain though so I'm happy I got that what is this this is this Africa is this like can oh not I was thinking Kenya but no it's Uganda with this car so the Google car helps the meta The Meta we have some palm trees well in Uganda the coverage is very very limited so basically if you if you are Uganda a good chance is that you will be near Kampala so let's guess there not bad not bad here we have interesting Road lines that's the first thing they notice the bollards um these are New Zealand Bowlers the Kiwi bollards so we are in the New Zealand New Zealand is one of the few countries which can have yellow solid line with white dashed lines other countries being uh um Argentina Uruguay Finland and the Philippines also could have this uh Middle Line combination kiwi poles as well a lot of cows I would probably go Northern I Island maybe hmm maybe I'm not sure it's either Northern Ireland or would this even be this South maybe should we risk it for the biscuit let's risk it for the biscuit no parking let's maybe go Southern for some reason I want to go south down here let's see ah it wasn't the original oh it was just the northern Island it felt for me it felt something a bit different so I guess I was wrong well this would be Japan because uh we have these um yellow big yellow plates kind of boxy cars also lower camera all good Clues and of course the language no phone numbers that I can see or numbers can be helpful this doesn't feel too north to me I would maybe go somewhere here maybe even more south it was even more south yeah okay these are some some tricky rounds well I'm getting the country right but uh the wrong side of the country these are the awesome ball as I was talking before talking about before with these dark reflectors so this would be Austria again with a lovely lovely corn fields now this looks way flatter than we had before so I would be inclined maybe to go all the way up here near Lin's maybe even oh very very East okay okay okay let's see how we did 18 000 points 18 000 points here all in all I think I did pretty good again let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/ooMKIj3egkqqqd4g", "data/images_geopeter/SkuTm9a6trawv1RK", "data/images_geopeter/RbLkg8EQXNI3Uq5Z"],

another Geo guessing video and in this one we are gonna play maps submitted by my viewers editor Peter here my apologies for looking barely woken up in this video that's a good lesson for me not to record videos that early in the morning but I still think it's a good video and I hope you enjoy it this is gonna be the first one an equator world with hand-picked locations all roughly 100 kilometers within the equatorial line all the play along links will be in the description and let's keep it let's say a minute per round shall we and no moving of course let's go so this looks very much like Latin American the question is this Colombia or Ecuador getting more Colombian Vibes maybe Zapatas with Zapatas what's Zapatas a city of I feel like I've heard of Zapatas okay nevermind this is not Colombia with these white license plates Colombia would have yellow ones so I think this should be Ecuador this is about this a place or am I tripping maybe some the pot this is just a regular word meaning something which I don't I thought it was a city so equatorial line goes there so we should be relatively close to it I don't see any Zapatas here it was shushufindi I love that name funny name I like it we have these kind of UK style bollards but this wouldn't be okay looking like this you can get these bollards as well in Indonesia from time to time I'm not sure exactly if they are specific to some certain Islands or not but let's have a look at the poles these balls uh I know you can get very similar poles and a flick like uh North colimantan you can even get them in in Malaysia as well very similar poles so I would kind of be leaning maybe yeah like we're gonna call it Kali Montan somewhere there in Indonesia we have like a palm tree there a little some some little mountains feels like there may be some water nearby so I feel North colimantan would be recent guess let's have a look North well North or east let's see okay it was West kalimantan fair enough I'm happy you got the right Island correct I guess you could get those poles in West kalimanton too but yeah studying Indonesia I I it's really tricky is this Indonesia again okay um Indonesia is such a big country but what I really enjoy studying it and practicing it there's still a lot to learn though I definitely mess up from time to time oh gosh now what is this gonna be this feels like Indonesia as well these poles and and Vibes and driving on the left side these satellite dishes you get in uh you get in Indonesia one of the few countries where you can get them I was thinking maybe something like um the Sumatra Island maybe oh I forgot that we are near equatorial line oh gosh I forgot which map we're playing okay so that helped because I would have guessed more south okay it was it was the right Island Again nice in the previous round I also should have guessed more salt because of that oh that's what I get for forgetting which map I'm playing what's the whole premise of the map okay we have the Brazilian poles these ones uh with the with the these indents so we would be in Brazil um in Brazil the equatorial line is pretty North so not too many options there where to guess the question is do we guess near makapa or do we guess what's the role Direction here road goes like that so it kind of aligns pretty well with these roads somewhere here so I think let's go there ish definitely is within 100 kilometers from the equator let's see let's go let's go oh this is a cool map I like it oh and this is unofficial huh WS what is Ws oh gosh I have blocked out the the author's names again oh no oh no they're dying the left side WS Western Sahara no yes no worries doesn't drive on the left side first of all and I I also don't think it would look this green with palm trees pretty much a big Desert from what I know I don't know it's WS y'all um this one is this one is beyond me oh no WS Maldives but it's a WS the Ws threw me off I wouldn't have guessed Maldives though to be fair okay oh again I forgot it's a near equatorial line oh my God foreign 500 points if I had remembered what map I was playing uh would be better but good map I really enjoyed it next one is less famous places with the same name by Darren basically what I'm gathering is the herbalek cities named after some bigger cities like uh you know Berlin in Colombia I think we've had it before or something like that okay let's get going let's get going again minute on the clock good luck Jamaica historical Foundation Jamaica well this would be the U.S very a lot of flags very patriotic astas Swiss in a head oh God they're really International here Jamaica Foundation Swiss in all in the USA now where though I'm getting kind of north um Eastern Vibes maybe maybe something like West Virginia maybe Pennsylvania let's go Pennsylvania maybe oh even more Northeast it was uh Vermont even more Northeast okay I had kind of kind of the right idea just just execution wasn't the best I don't know if I could have found Jamaica there or not Paris Optical American National Bank are are these locations all going to be in the U.S or business business 80 to 271. um those are uh State row numbers so if unless I know the state there really isn't point to try to find them we do have front plates yeah I don't know about the state but um just from The Vibes it feels kind of a northern us like let's go Iowa maybe wasn't Northern at all it was Texas well Northern Texas was there a way to tell it was Texas maybe if you know license plates I don't really know license plates if you saw any other ways to tell it was Texas please let me know South Ohio Ebron what's the international name here wait are we not in Ohio oh God I immediately assumed we were in Ohio maybe we're not in Ohio oh no wait wait wait wait is this Canada is this Ohio in Canada hey Brawn hey Brawn I don't know where that is is this actually Canada we don't have front plates so it could be something like a Quebec I don't know or or Nova Scotia could this be Nova Scotia I was Nova Scotia actually was there where was Hebron I didn't see Hebron anywhere I thought Hebron would be bigger and I didn't see Ohio anywhere here either oh here we have those those Road numbers that that style is that not a Scotia specific oh it might be actually I did not know that learning something new here apparently if you get these kind of uh brown-ish Road numbers you will be in Nova Scotia here now I know now I know that's that's cool that can really come come in handy in the future West Berlin Presbyterian Church yeah a lot a lot of North American rounds this might be a North American specific map but you can definitely get some famous place names outside of us like Colombia I believe has a lot of um a lot of cities named after other cities as well I I would I would not know where this is to be fair uh speed wait this is a speed wait if it if it says speed I think I might be mistaken uh it might not be saying speed but if it says only speed it would be Oregon I think because usually in the US you see speed limit they did not say speed usually in the US you say you see speed limit and in Canada it says maximum speed I'm learning a lot of new in this a video because to my knowledge I thought only Oregon had speed I guess Ohio has only speed as well interesting interesting gotta add add that to my mental notes as well but yeah uh I'm pretty sure you can get only speed in Oregon as well I thought it was unique to there but I guess not Atlanta Community Building yeah this is this is very North American map well I'm guessing it's not Atlanta we have front plates again yeah I'm getting North US Vibes no idea which state this would be let's go Minnesota wait we did have front plates let's go North Dakota Bismarck let's go Bismarck I was Nebraska okay how did we do total is 11.6 000 points taking into account it was North American specific map I'm pretty happy with with my scores next map is a little bit worrying because it says easy 5K in the title but the average score is 6.3 000. so so I'm expecting some very difficult locations here but I I hope I beat the average score that is 6.3 thousand oh no wait let me enable the uh names okay now I have the author's names enabled because because if we're if we're playing these types of maps then the author's name is very very important wall King paints and coating okay okay I'm guessing with the the The Vibes and I think we have some uh maybe Bengali maybe maybe a different language it would be somewhere somewhere like India or Bangladesh somewhere in that area we have a religious symbol on the wall as well um let's go let's look on the Northern India partner maybe just a random guess let's see it was misplaced are you kidding me I I see how this is going I see how this is and this map is going okay okay okay James South gecko digital Global LTD is the author oh very cool location I'm guessing this is like a like a hotel like a like a private home you can rent out very pretty I have to say could this be one of those houses in Maldives I know you have like a lot of same houses next to each other there because we see another house right outside so it might be there or it might be misplaced again right here oh no oh no I'm scared now I I I'll guess where I think this actually is but uh uh it might be misplaced are you kidding me foreign should I guess near Africa again I think I might I think we're driving on the right side here this definitely feels kind of Mediterranean to me and we can a northern Morocco or something is that a flag is that a Spanish flag should I should I just guess again here where all the other locations have been I'm very torn should I should I guess where I think it is or should I guess here let's guess okay let's guess I'll guess Northern Morocco let's see oh my God what okay basically there all of the locations in this map must be misplaced but that's what I'm learning here oh I hate these types of a map so we're in a gym we are in a gym the author is bona tour well if all of these locations are misplaced then there is absolutely no point in trying to figure out where where we actually are right so I think I will just guess here because a lot of a lot of locations I think the zero zero coordinates go here so a lot of locations if you haven't specified the actual location there will be zero zero so it will be somewhere around this area so let's go there not too bad got some 800 points I I hate this map I'm not a fan of this map sorry it reads who the author of this map Corey Tiba PR Corey IBA I probably should know where koretiba is we have these Brazilian style uh poles and plates p r like PR here is PR Parana I just couldn't remember surely this is misplaced as well surely this is not in the actual kuritiba right of course of course it's there on the coast of Africa well this map sucked this map sucked continuing the fun we had on the previous map the next one is beautiful confusing and impossible Maps I hope these are not misplaced at least because I don't mean difficult locations but what I really find annoying is when they are misplaced that's what I don't like oh this looks difficult indeed the author is Julian moordret airstrip oh Ariana like a tiny island in the middle of nowhere airstrip well this is unofficial coverage of course as suggested by the author's name so this could be pretty much any Island um I was thinking maybe something like American Samoa maybe something like uh I don't know somewhere here a US Virgin British British Virgin Islands maybe let's go British Virgin Islands because why not but genuinely could be could be anywhere could be Hawaii maybe or or somewhere in Guam or something let's see Guyana okay wasn't nearly as close as a coastal as I thought kalitude Falls and there is an airstrip nearby indeed so it was not misplaced though that's a very interesting location huh okay okay starting out good uh V Bill Brocks is the author oh very autumny coverage we have water going through can't really trust the sun very very flat is what I'm seeing very flat oh could this be like rural Russia or something super flat nothing inside no cities no roads oh gosh I'm thinking maybe somewhere here no idea really though that's a risky guys but we gotta risk it for the biscuit right it was rural Russia just absolutely not where I guessed okay I thought this I thought this area is a bit more more hilly but I guess not next one man uh money adjust is the author oh what what Okay Okay Google this this coverage is on a tractor pulled by a tractor okay very creative um these poles this Vibes this um Sandy Sandy nature I kind of want to go something like who's Pakistan or or Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan maybe kind of want to go somewhere there maybe near the uh the Caspian Sea let's go Kazakhstan near Caspian Sea maybe because this field is kinda like with the lake nearby or something let's see ah it was India ah interesting Oh I thought we had some water nearby okay could be worse still got at least thousand points there I think the average on this map was three thousand so we've already I hope beaten it Axel torn is the author Excel Thorn whenever I see these palm trees this is gonna round palm trees I think either Cambodia Thailand Sri Lanka or I think I've seen them in Brazil but but my first thoughts are always kind of Cambodia Thailand somewhere there in that area so I think that's where I will guess because of those palm trees but you can definitely get them elsewhere definitely but that's where I mostly see them let's see okay well I did mention you can get them in Brazil I don't think I've seen them in Argentina before so that wasn't a good round fair enough oh gosh what is this there you are we are in a greenhouse the author is reservea I know you get a lot of greenhouses like white greenhouses like this in southern Spain in Almeria the almirian greenhouses they are kind of famous so I have no idea if these are actually the ones but uh that's that would probably be my best guess let's see let's get somewhere here hmm it was in Iran apparently so just a random Greenhouse in Iran let's see 3 800 points not a very good uh game but we beat the average score if you want me to try some of your maps you can either send them in on Discord or leave their map name in the comments Below on the right side there will be another Play Along video where I play viewer maps huge thanks although the patreons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "image_not_available": [5], "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/xXvmoI3888lgp9aY",

play a map with some potentially tricky locations we're gonna play a map called Dom test for smart people which contains some locations which should be quite easy to recognize and find and some locations which might appear to be easy but turn out to be quite difficult so let's get going let's have a look uh the player on links as always will be in the description if you want to play along and if you enjoy these play along videos don't forget to press that like button here we go okay this one should be one of the easy ones right this is the Big Ben in London uh you you always got to be wary of local likes because from what I understand there is one of the correct item the real big Ben and there is one look-alike in this map so always gotta be gotta pay attention is this the real one or is this the look alike but I'm pretty sure this is the real one we see these London buses here and and and I see I think and we have the the I think that's the Westminster Abbey I think and behind the Big Ben so let's go to London uh Westminster Big Ben and it is to our South East so I think we are like on this road here oh this is that little pathway yeah nice start nice start but to be fair this was very easy so let's get going so now is this the real Coliseum or not oh um it might be can we see any Italian plates here those don't appear to be Italian front plates oh gosh what would this be if not Italy oh no they School tours the language looks French no La rig de la region we have like a matador here I think that's that's how you call them this is this is France I think but where and the the front plates in it Italy the front plate should be narrow with blue on both sides these ones look uh regular sized so yeah that's that's what I'm talking about when talking about tricky locations because because in a regular game I might as well have gone with Italy immediately but here I don't know I'm thinking maybe kind of near ish Italy one of these cities chronoble I don't know we don't have much time let's go Grenoble cause why not okay it was kind of close-ish to Italy it was a different city than I went but it was Nims is that how you call it it was denims sorry if I'm in pronunciation oh hey oh this is like like an Amphitheater we've had some similar ones before on this channel in some other play-along videos um oh gosh I have blocked out the author's name oh no I don't see who the author is that's that's not good oh no sometimes you can use the author's name to your advantage of it so the question is would this be Greece or would this be somewhere else I've seen these theaters in other countries as well I've seen like a similar one I think we had it in Italy or France even I think I'll just go Greece because I don't have a better guess and it's not like there are any other Clues around here so I I think I'll be going um Greece here maybe it was Turkey I mean turkey makes sense you can get these these amphitheaters and like all the other different ancient ruins in basically all of the Mediterranean countries you can see some Indonesia as well you can even see some in Jordan so yeah director he doesn't surprise me there at least that wasn't too far okay now is this the real Leaning Tower of Pisa why do we have an American flag there is that an American flag it's not the real Tower of Pisa no through traffic oh I wish I knew those plates but I don't so this is somewhere in the US judging by the flag a learning Tower YMCA education series at Main South High School okay we might be in Maine Maine South I mean like Brunswick Maine South High School Portland maybe Portland seems like a pretty uh big city um these these trees felt quite Northern as well these um little Christmas trees so I I think let's go Portland maybe would be nice if we want uh Maine South High School but uh even if we don't should be pretty decent I think what it did say main no Main South High School I'm so confused I guess it says YMCA Chicago there could I have re-read it I could not have read it oh these rounds are so annoying when you like find a clue and it turns out to be absolutely wrong now this is the the Sphinx and this should be this looks looks like the real deal with all of these souvenir sellers I remember my trip to Egypt a lot a lot of these people selling you kind of souvenirs some fake souvenirs as well but yeah so this is things let's try to find it because I always struggle finding the pyramids uh on map I always struggle they're somewhere here Black Pyramid red pyramid Giza necropolis okay Great Sphinx of Giza is here I think this is official coverage so we so we should be able to trust the compass the Sphinx is right to our kind of North you can see the pyramid in like behind it so we should be somewhere here with the valley Temple right behind us so let's see okay perfect score how did we do in total 19 900 points so some better on some worse rounds at least I got two perfect scores so uh let's keep going this map only has 60 locations so it might be getting some repeats I hope we don't but uh gotta keep that in mind so would this be Venice this doesn't feel like Venice to me it feels like a ripoff Venice we have Las Vegas here yeah is this actually Vegas though that's the real question here the Asian Bistro Something New York level 2 the Palazzo at for a second I thought it might be like a fake city in China because I've seen some like these these uh kind of imitation cities in China looking like this but I don't see any Chinese anywhere so I don't think it would be I think I'll just go maybe Las Vegas even though it doesn't look like it but I mean it's designed not to look like it I guess so Ah that's that's my thinking here I don't know where it would be exactly let's see let's see it was Las Vegas it was Las Vegas um the niche or the Venetian I've heard of the Venetian didn't cross my mind that it would be there I wouldn't have found it to see their way because you need to zoom in a lot to to notice it oh well this isn't the the Parthenon was that the name well this this isn't Greece this looks like the US again we have some statue of someone I'm not sure who that is ah which city would this be Federal defenses wait this little logo was it Connecticut or am I tripping oh gosh well we have no front plate on that car but we do have front plates on other cars that's confusing we don't have front plate on that we have front plate okay we don't have front plates on many cars Connecticut should have front plates Ohio is this a high I remember seeing this thing on one of the flags I think I don't remember which flag it was though Ohio would make sense with although the both front plates and no front plates because I think they switched to no front Place relatively recently so let's go Ohio in Columbus right in the middle of Columbus it was Tennessee oh was it on the Tennessee flag it was the Tennessee flag this is what I was thinking about but couldn't remember which state it was so if you knew your state flags you probably got a good score there yeah here we have a repeat as as suspected um can I remember where it was it was memes right neem neem somewhere here somewhere down here I think let's go let's go next oh now this looks like the real Parthenon we have the Greek flag as well um it should be relatively easy to find I think Acropolis parthenonos it is I think this is official or maybe it isn't actually I'm not sure okay we have the flagpole there on the map so we're in between the flagpole and Parthenon uh in between so somewhere here then nice let's go next round oh no no this is The Fakes Sphinx pretty big difference between the real one and the fake one now this should be like Las Vegas now what I'm noticing is this Las Vegas has a lot of fake things Luxor casino and hotel Mandalay Bay Luxor okay let's try to find Luxor I guess I think this should be Las Vegas right we have Luxor and what was this called Mandalay Bay I think I've heard of looks or Sahara Las Vegas Mirage Caesar's Palace MGM all the big ones are here Luxor here we have Luxor here is the Sphinx Luxor tram station yeah it said something about tram here on this sign we are right in front of the Sphinx yeah yeah yeah okay almost a perfect score that Tennessee flag if only I had recognized it the score would have been even better than this okay let's do one more let's do one more game oh whoops we need to do a challenge not not a single player game I hope the the previous ones were challenges now is this the real deal one way except by takes one way I think it should be I think it should be the San Francisco bridge the golden garbage so it would be to our South East so somewhere here near the Viewpoint is this the Viewpoint this might be the Golden Gate Viewpoint I think it looks like it I think it aligns pretty well right we would be somewhere right here I think nice Good Start let's go okay surely this is the real Statue of Liberty too early no which country is this is this France we have who the play at the um science look there could be French we have the waffle pole which France is one of the countries where you can get them Belgium is a possibility but oh no I think this is a very typical French pole here as well so I think this should be France I would think maybe I'm like northern France kind of towers this is a very interesting roof very interesting roof I don't think I've ever seen a roof like this in France with a little slope like that I would be thinking in the northern France maybe like a near Nancy this is a hilly hilly area so let's see okay not that East it was kind of Northern but but different area another repeat uh do I remember where this was oh this was the Chicago one where it went in may now I remember that one now where in Chicago exactly I didn't really pay attention where exactly but I I just remember it was in Chicago but let's just go there it was a bit more North there leaning tower of Niles this area is called Niles that's why it's the leaning tower of Niles fair enough okay we have a bridge HMS Royal Marines in the Royal Naval um would this be UK entrance this is UK I do not recognize this bridge I'm not sure if this is the famous place or is this the rip-off because I do not recognize this place backyard Bike Shop swing Bridge pipe well gate pipe well gate I do not know where in the UK this is I'm sorry architecture I don't know how North would this be would this be like gloss go squiggly Bridge that's a nice name for a bridge I don't see swing Bridge anywhere here though ah it was not Glasgow oh it was Newcastle upon Tyne Tyne Bridge oh here is the swing Bridge yeah okay that was it did not know it was that the famous place was that the Ripoff not sure let's move on this is the real deal this is the Arc of Triumph in France I have been here a long time ago but still people here drive like crazy let me tell you I I remember everyone driving wherever they want so arcade Triumph is to our uh North Northwest you can hear ish I think we should be here then okay A bit more oh that was that road still perfect score Let's Go 23 000. so all in all most of the rounds were pretty easy somewhere tricky just as promised so let me know in the comments how you did in this Challenge and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy each thanks all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ",

some Urban world I'm quite excited we haven't played these satellite videos in a while so the play along links as always will be in the description make sure you uh play them before watching this video if you want to play along and if you don't know how to set up the all of this looking from above the link will be in top right corner okay okay so what is the first location here um we have some clouds where our shadows is that the shadow I guess the Shadows are going a little bit to the north getting I'm getting big European Vibes here looking at these roofs a kind of a western Europe maybe something like Belgium maybe Germany um we are driving on the right side are we these look like like one-way roads so so let's find a bigger Road maybe yeah we are driving on the right side as expected wait oh wait wait wait we've had this thing before this this uh not Pentagon was a star oh where was it was it uh oh oh gosh which city I think it was was it like like Belgium or from or was it France it might have been northern France oh which city was it little no it wasn't was it little it was a little it was a lil okay it was a little I thought I remembered this one this is just just purely memory because I mean My First DS would have been Belgium there which I mean northern France close enough with these Rubes this round building this is an interesting one usually you can see like round stadiums like that in Spain for bull fighting not sure what that one was for but okay let's try to pinpoint this we are right below that star the roads align so it's definitely there it's not a different star but star is very unique from above once you've seen it then then you'll probably remember it I think we should be on this road who the balloon balloon okay let's go nice great start oh exciting I'm very happy that I remembered it because usually I don't remember repeat okay now this looks trickier we have two rivers going through the city which could help with pinpointing it may be if we get that far okay we are driving on the right side yes the rules I'm thinking Europe again looking at these roofs Shadows are going north but where exactly that's that's a good question I'm thinking maybe Germany maybe um maybe this is this would be Belgium these I feel like in Belgium you get a lot of these darker roofs a lot of these agricultural Fields this doesn't seem like this is not going to be a cap at all but seems like a pretty big city decently sized I would think maybe kind of Western Germany maybe Belgium let's see if anything aligns I was maybe starting to think this could be nether the Netherlands because it looks very flat and we had some zoomed in we had some bike Lanes as well which a lot of a lot of bike Lanes I mean all over the place so somewhere with a Good biking infrastructure so the Netherlands would make sense so that's that's kind of my thinking here so I'm paying attention to some of the Dutch cities now I think that city is smaller than I initially thought some of these smaller Dutch cities would look really similar in terms of like the river is going through but I I can't find the right one wait oh my God it is Maastricht it is Maastricht okay makes sense that the border of the Netherlands in Belgium I had kind of given up there for a second to be honest because I thought it's pointless we have this roundabout here we have the other roundabout there somewhere here I think I think oh found it so let's go okay let's keep going let's keep going okay somewhere very foresty very foresty oh oh oh oh and a big river okay okay um something to remember since we're playing Urban world the coverage that we have should all have official coverage since we're playing the urban world map I sometimes play some official uh Maps sometimes I play some unofficial or maps of unofficial locations as well this time we have official ones um where could my first ad was uh Brazil my first art was Brazil because in Brazil you can get a lot of these very very I don't know Wiggly Rivers I don't know how to call them that's my first thought let's zoom in let's have a closer look at what we see here are we driving in the right side first of all I think we are I think we are from what we can see we have some blue roofs which you often see blue roofs in um Asia but you can see them sometimes like in South America as well we have an airport a small but still an airport here can we see the Shadows the Shadows are going north Shadows are definitely going north I mean if this was it if this is Brazil it is Northern Brazil so Shadows going north would fit let's have a look does this Northern Brazil would that work well this might not be Brazil then because it doesn't really align I don't think what else could this be is this a city though this is a very Korean City I'll be honest I'm very confused about what this is so Northern Hemisphere driving on the right side and super super green with some blue robes some black robes with all of these blurs could this could this be somewhere in Asia but where where in Asia would it be driving in the right if we were driving the left side I would consider something like um Bangladesh but they're on the right side could this be um Cambodia would that work let's have a look I guess I can definitely see some similarities in terms of the the river yeah so I guess it's definitely worth checking uh having a closer look I don't know I don't know nothing really aligns perfectly you know this doesn't feel that Asian to me I don't know I'd rather go Latin America here but I don't think you have Rivers like that in like Mexico and Guatemala though it wouldn't be Colombia with it so unless I'm missing something in Brazil could this ever be somewhere in Africa I don't think the country's with official coverage have Rivers like that oh 30 seconds remaining yeah I'm I'm lost I think I will go Latin America like Northern Brazil I'm not super happy with this round Russia Northern Rush wow okay I didn't really consider Russia too much um definitely didn't feel that Northern to me you can get blue roofs in Northern places too sometimes so that makes sense just didn't feel that that Northern yeah not the greatest round for me there oh yeah oh no and this feels like a small place again what what can we found about this find about this place we have a course might be the uh like the football club's name the language I would I would say this is like um something like Croatia or or I don't know Serbia or somewhere this area that would be my initial guess here looking at that language and uh uh the the the roofs are kind of uh pretty reddish some railroads which doesn't really help too much the Shadows are going north we are driving on the right side so so everything fits the question is here which country is this because I I don't speak the language so I can't really I don't really know what language that stadium has there we have a river a bigger River to our East and then a smaller River going right uh next to the city so maybe we can use that to try to figure out it doesn't feel very mountainous yeah let's see maybe we can find Aussie yet or something ah here we have Aussie I thought I have seen Aussie yet before it's a pretty big city in Croatia okay and there is that River okay nice honestly the city looked smaller than this we have a bridge that's the that's that bridge okay there is that road and we are right next to the railroads I think it would be this this this black house that we are in front of the black roof let's go let's go another 5K after that previous terrible run oh no another Forest you know what happened last time we got Forest oh okay oh this oh wow this is a huge enormous City what is this I feel like I should know my first thought was turkey with like a like a gap here between the city but uh Istanbul looks different it wouldn't be Istanbul oh okay let's let's zoom in let's have a closer look we have a big Stadium which said are we driving on we are driving on the right side a lot of kind of these white roofs white roofs and orange roofs couldn't get a Mediterranean Vibes where where what would this be very touristy Coast which you would expect still quite green could it be Brazil oh I think this might be Brazil which side is that the Shadows the Shadows are kind of south-ish now yeah a little bit South yeah ah interesting with these with these brownish orangey roofs I would have would have expected it to be kind of European but I now I think it might be somewhere here like Rio is is it Rio it is real I think with this this road and with this road here it would fit perfectly yeah yeah it is real because what gave the Rio away for me were these mountains the the coast with big mountains Green Mountains right next to the coast that's I feel like that's a big real thing and uh this location I would I really love to visit Rio one day really obviously I watched some documentaries and videos about it looks really cool I have this small place and we would be somewhere up here ish so we have this intersection here and we are west of it are we on this road I think maybe maybe we might be here let's Zoom we have a one long building which is a hospital I think we would and this is another long building yeah I think we would be right here oh let's go the summary of the first game 20 000 points or four perfect scores and one not so perfect one and let's go for the second game if you're enjoying these uh videos don't forget to press that like button so so that YouTube and myself we know that you enjoy them we have a pretty big city with our River going through some skyscrapers would this be the us maybe which side are we driving on the reason why I'm thinking us is because we are a lot we have a lot of these kind of um grid like grid-like roads very much which is very common in North America so us or Canada would be my first thoughts here we have a baseball field which is more common in North America as well to baseball fields a big airport very big airport with the runways all over the place I mean it is a big big city so it would make sense now where we have a lot of agricultural Fields looks quite flat the soil is quite red I mean us is big I would love to narrow it down somehow maybe maybe there is a stadium with some team names a state name somewhere Winnipeg Winnipeg okay I don't know if this is Winnipeg because sometimes you can get as in one of my previous videos sometimes you get completely different uh names but it says Winnipeg here which well let's go to Winnipeg let's have a look if this works we do have a river going through Winnipeg it looks like it is Winnipeg honestly I was thinking it would be more Southern I wasn't thinking Canada myself I was thinking more us but I mean if it aligns then and it says Winnipeg then it is Winnipeg I guess so we are somewhere here ish we have these two roads across the river we are somewhere in between them somewhere here I think we are like right there next to the cafe 22 Pizza Hotline if you've been there are they good are they any good nice perfect oh more forests EPA I mean forests are good oh my God sneezing I hate sneezing okay um this is Coastal again a big city my thought my first thought was uh Sydney but I don't think it works I don't I think Sydney looks a bit different oh we have uh something Hampton Pirates where is Hampton Hampton or somewhere English speaking the Shadows would the Shadows are going north and we are driving on the right side it looks like yeah yellow middle lines again so this would be again North America probably is this Canada or us this time I'm not sure yet feel more Southern than the previous one so I would probably go us Hampton we have more baseball fields we have a look like a very interesting kind of Fortress here it looks like to our East there is Big Blue nothing s so I would assume that this is east coast because of that now we are looking for a city used with kind of uh like we're maybe a river starts here to our West it's kind of a big big water away in between the city I don't think it's gonna be Florida that doesn't feel as warm as Florida but let's move move up from there somewhere somewhere here maybe does that work we don't really have a road here do we I mean it appears that there is some road and it ends or is it being built here oh is there is a tunnel is there a tunnel here underneath there is a tunnel here Hampton Roads bridge tunnels yes yes this is also this is Hampton Newport News oh my gosh that's such a weird name for the City Newport News I don't know if this is about this city in particular but I think I heard a story that in the US a city changed their name just so the radio station started broadcasting for them I don't know if it's this this time but Newport News is definitely a very weird name so we would be on the Northern side of this water somewhere here one of these roads Rio thessly Street Rio thessly maybe a surname I'm not sure what Rio thessly is oh okay a little bit off 23 meters but still perfect score let's go oh oh oh oh what is this now looks okay looks like a big city again I like big cities they are usually easy to find okay now it looks more like Coast is on the left side this time it appears let's zoom in let's have a look is this the US again because I see again a lot of these kind of grid-like streets so again my first thought without even zooming too much in my first that would be again maybe us possibly or Canada we are driving on the right side we have shadows going to the north so that would all fit but uh it's not confirmed yet so I'm looking for some other Clues maybe the houses the style just feels very American to me I can definitely imagine this being like like a suburb of America looking for any stadiums I haven't seen a single one yet which is kind of surprising maybe this side no this is more more private houses a huge airport very huge airport here right on the on the coast it seems okay now this this would be a place where I would expect some stadiums where are all the stadiums at are these things looking uh for baseball okay that kind of reminded me of the base of that baseball formation so maybe there are some baseball fields here yeah okay I can't find anything definitive that this is or isn't America but I think let's try to try to align it because I think this this could be kind of Western us or Canada so let's have let's have a look so it's it's not Vancouver is it is it Vancouver wait it is Vancouver oh gosh I I wanted to start from Vancouver I didn't think it actually was Vancouver but it aligns it is Vancouver yeah okay so it was it was Canada okay let's let's try to align it now we are like here ish here is that green part which is a Bayern Creek Ravine Park there's the railroad we are a little bit south of the railroad there we are on the street with no name I think right behind Janet Leong violin Studio let's see perfect round number four now from the first glance without zooming out uh my first star was Switzerland let's zoom out and see if my first thought was right or not very mountainous very like snowy mountain tops super super hilly so it definitely could be could be Switzerland from what I can see the houses the robes the I I think this looks very European the Shadows are going to the north yeah so I think this might as well be Switzerland which said are we driving on it should be right side I imagine and these yellow pedestrian Crossings I think you could see them in Switzerland as well because of the snow in many countries where you see these yellow Road lines it's oftentimes because of the snow so it's easier to see uh in snowy snowy times oh gosh now oh how easy is it going to be to find a small mountain town in Switzerland huh easy easy peasy easy peasy well okay let's have a look so we have big mountains all over all all around us basically there is a small River small River going through there is a small River here this kind of a lines no way I actually found it immediately actually I actually I think I actually found it immediately okay where is it it is I just zoomed in oh what the hell uh okay I'm honestly I thought I'm gonna spend seven minutes looking for a needle in a haystack so I am very happy that I managed to somehow find it immediately now we just gotta pinpoint it uh we have like a small roundabout here we have a lot of small roundabouts actually roundabouts are safer than regular intersections apparently is what I've heard that that's why a lot of European countries use more and more roundabouts so I think this is this one I think so we would be on the first street over like big the quality is really good really really good qualities for the satellite imagery here okay nice 11 meters away let's go let's go and oh gosh oh my gosh somewhere very mountainous apparently it seems oh summer mountainous another small a small place red Rubes looks like the red soil mappers that would be Brazil maybe with this type of red soil a lot of greenery the town doesn't seem too big but we do have a airport so that might help us identify it maybe let's have a look the Shadows do we see where the Shadows are going it looks like the Shadows are going to the north yeah um so maybe it could be Northern Brazil would Northern Brazil have these mountains though maybe this is something like Colombia instead I'm not sure if Colombian rooftops would look like this we have a pretty big river pretty big river going like this I think let's have a look at uh Colombia first because of the mountains and then move on to maybe Brazil there is a river but it looks different with a lot of like smaller sections and small islands all over the place so I don't think it's that River yeah I'm not convinced by Colombia there now could this be Brazil now in these Northern parts I really don't think they are that hilly so where could this be then where else could this be could this be me these are a lot of copy paste houses all of them looking the same I think Mexico is worth checking out or maybe Guatemala Guatemala can be quite hilly as well I don't see a river that would match in Guatemala though hmm are these like golf Fields or something I I'm kind of flabbergasted here cause everything I thought it could be it doesn't seem to be could this ever be Asia I really thought this was um look like Latin America but what if this is Asia maybe with these roofs wait but we're driving the right side right did I check it where did I check the driving side where which which side which side are we driving here I think we're driving on the right side here yeah okay because I thought some of the roofs can remind me of Indonesian rules but it can't be Indonesia with driving in the right could this ever become body I mean there are some hilly Parts in Cambodia but I don't see this being Cambodia maybe the Philippines I'm I'm really all over the place on this one I don't I don't know I I don't think it would be the Philippines this doesn't feel like it yeah I don't think there's Point waiting the 30 remaining seconds because I have absolutely no idea I think I'll guess in Colombia but uh let's see let's see how wrong am I it was Asia after all loss our laws didn't cross my mind to be honest I considered Cambodia Philippines but not loss okay yeah it aligns really well long prabang airport well in both of the games I had one round where I kinda plopped and the other ones pretty good let me know in the comments how you did if you played along and on the right side there will be another satellite view video I think you will enjoy huge thanks all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope y'all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "images_path":

could end up anywhere in the world we have played this map once before you enjoyed it I enjoyed it so let's play it again why not right as I mentioned we could be anywhere in the world both official coverage on official coverage let's have it a minute and a half no moving the play along links will be in the description just play it before watching this video as usual you already know the drill what do we have here Aziz is the author unofficial coverage so contrast the sun with this type of kind of um clothing I don't know what's the proper term but I remember seeing these these kind of like big white uh clothes in Egypt when I visited Egypt um kind of that area so I'm thinking maybe kind of northern northern Africa Saudi Arabia maybe somewhere there I think Egypt might be a decent shout it's kind of in that area in the general area the author's name is Aziz doesn't help too much there all we have is some bushes and very shallow shallow River so yeah let's I think we just lock it in okay Qatar oh interesting I mean makes sense I was hoping it would be a little bit closer than that but Qatar makes perfect sense yeah kind of I had the right right idea but uh yeah was a bit further than I thought we have a yellow back plate uh is there a way to tell which side we're driving on just looking at this bike does this uh I've never thought about this before but it does this kind of kind of like where you like lean it does it indicate which side we are driving on or no any bike owners in the in the comments maybe you know it would this indicate anything or no or is it the same for all the bikes uh looking at this uh definitely feels like Europe with a yellow back plate I'm thinking maybe something like Luxembourg the Netherlands maybe it feels kind of flat I could definitely see this being maybe the Netherlands yeah with a yellow back plate could this ever be UK maybe I don't know since this motorbike is parked on the right side of the road I'm thinking probably we're drawing the right side maybe not sure but but that's that's my thinking that we would be driving the right side the houses uh I don't know but maybe maybe I I could see them maybe being Dutch um where in the Netherlands very very flat I mean most of the Netherlands is very very flat so let's just guess somewhere kind of in the middle Denmark makes sense I I actually I consider Denmark for a second because of all of the uh wind turbines but I know you can get wind turn runs a lot in the Netherlands as well so do Danish motorbikes have yellow plates because I know you in Denmark you sometimes can have yellow plates but usually I see it for like some company vehicles or something maybe there was a company bike I don't know but yeah I have so many questions so little answers so we have tuta chati is the author here very tropical looking Place very beautiful looking place I have to see I have to say but where ah you already know I don't like guessing these Beach locations cause I never know where to guess too toxic I have I have absolutely zero idea this is this is some sort of an island some sort of an island I'm thinking maybe Caribbean maybe not an island maybe uh maybe Coastal Africa very tropical very very tropical so maybe like Liberia uh again we can't trust the compass so the water might be to our North West might not be let's go Liberia maybe something like let's let's switch to liquid or let's see let's switch to Gabon I don't know okay oh it was uh was it is it comoros okay so it was an island the compass was actually right this time yeah I don't know how I could have gotten that one to be honest because I did go Africa but Africa is so huge very tricky rounds I have to say we're not getting any official coverage these Beach locations oh my God and another one another Coastal one okay looking at these houses these these houses look very very Irish to me or Northern UK like kind of Northern Ireland maybe definitely feeling that area because these are white light houses with gray roofs feels very much like that area the author is Frank Charlie Frank Charlie maybe somewhere like here one one of these places because we can see some land in the distance some islands other Islands um so yeah I think it might be somewhere here-ish maybe maybe a bit more North but yeah let's let's see I would go Ireland here it was more North it was more North yeah but I'm very happy with this guess actually it was quite close 53 kilometers one actually really good guys so yeah I think we did have a compass correct oh no this is a broken Photosphere no this is unfortunate I tried to refresh it but it still doesn't work okay the the new meta people used to guess in Antarctica when the locations were broken the new new common uh new what's the word the new thing to do I forgot the word to use I used to guess the Eiffel Tower so let's guess Eiffel Tower if you ever get broken locations in your competitive games the new Customs I guess that's the word easier to guess the Eiffel Tower so yeah this let's let's hope the author of this map removes that broken location let's play again let's play it again hopefully this time we don't get any broken locations that game I get like 10 000 points not the greatest but I was very happy with it Irish round there so let's get going what do we have oh some sort of a general or something some sort of a statue this is a cool one the author is Dan brotea or I thought there was a car crash but no they're just very closely parked to each other these pedestrian crossing signs giving me kind of Romanian Vibes could this be Romania maybe is that a flag that kind of looks like it might be a Romanian flag there maybe um I am thinking Romania currently can't really read any language or does it say primaria resecto I can't really read it very well can't really read it we have some reddish plate what huh it looks like oh could this could this be Moldova Clinica could this ever be Moldova or is this just Romania Moldova would use some Cyrillic though no because I don't see Cyrillic here and this also doesn't look like like Cyrillic so I would still go Romania does it remain oh gosh ah the time okay I didn't have time to guess in Bucharest I was going in a tangent about Romanian and moldovan flags because they are very similar but okay it was just the capital just Bucharest but I'm glad at least I managed to guess in time because I almost was too late there peter.claw twitter.com some sort of a gym or something the author is Roy Roy Mohan yeah Roy Mohan sportcentrum galgen VOD is that kind of German sounds kind of German to me I don't know what garlic gulgenvod hoganvard might be like a place name the golgenward sports center garlic so this may be Germany might be Austria maybe garlic and VOD I don't see any other language we should kind of confirm or or deny physio people yeah I I could definitely see this being Germany wait what does it say de hexen Ketel that doesn't sound German what is there could this be some what could this be I don't know ah Belgium I don't know I don't know I don't know uh I don't know I'm going Belgium I don't know look it was the Netherlands garlic and VOD oh is it with double A I didn't notice there was there was double a double A does sound more Dutch because of the golgen vods I thought it sounded kind of more German so I went with Eastern Belgium because of that but yeah still pretty good score I would say maybe I could have figured out it was uh the Netherlands maybe but I'll take I'll take whatever I can get I'm happy with that the author is so Cyrillic we have oh no that's just the wind wind sock I think is the the term just a wind sock some yellow plates why do we have yellow plates here what those yellow plates are causing some questions we have a completely white plate here as well that looks like a Russian plate to me completely wet with what appears to maybe be a Russian flag on the right side maybe I'm not sure what's up with those yellow plates there though um looking like this very Sandy kind of I know you can get some Sandy areas near surbut so maybe this is somewhere nearby kind of that area I don't really know I'm sure you can get some sand in other areas as well I just know playing regular Geo guesser if you ever get Russia that looks like so let's go somewhere there maybe oh it was Kazakhstan huh makes sense makes sense um yeah maybe it was a Russian plate maybe it wasn't I mean I'm sure you can find some Russian plates in Kazakhstan as well okay Kazakhstan makes makes a lot of sense there okay could have could have wished for a bit of a closer score there but uh but it's fine okay this looks very tropical again feels like an island immediately maybe what is that ah oh gosh is that an Australian flag or oh no it looks like we have that uh Union Jack with some white stars would this be Australia though or could this be like like Fiji or something what does it say does it say Fiji on that plate in mind it's mine say Fiji it looks like there are like four letters possibly there I can't can't tell if for sure if it's Fiji or not but I would go Fiji at this point we said I'll be driving on here we are driving on the opposite side on the left side of the road we have a yellow plate there but it looks like a taxi um so Fiji Fiji does drive on the left side right let's quickly verify it yes they do drive on the left side as indicated by this roundabout um oh wait we have another flag here and it does look like a Fiji flag I think Fiji does have kind of a like a light blue like that let's go Suva let's go Suva uh I think I'm pretty happy with my guess here i i p i v h k I don't think that indicates the area nice let's go very close guess there very happy with this one I'm glad I noticed that Fiji flag as well so that kind of verified the suspicions what is this a yantarney so we have a is that a Belarusian plate I think it says b-y this would be Belarus maybe then empty I don't know if that empty helps me can we maybe find the Antoni in um Belarus I'm thinking this would be Belarus yeah I do not see any yantarnis here so it's either it's too small all or it's not in Belarus I think it's probably just too small let's let's see let's keep it somewhere in the middle and it was all very kind of young tan oh my it was so tiny no yeah it doesn't even show up unless you zoom right on top of it super super small yeah no chance I would find it but still the score was good even despite that Kazakhstan round twenty thousand pretty good I would say pretty good let's go for another one third time's the charm again the link in the description we have yellow plate the first thing that I noticed what are they though yellow back plates some English there Beast building that's nice peace building driving the right side yellow back plate White Front plates now where would this be prime insurance company looks quite hilly driving the right side in Africa with yellow back plates and white front plates I am not sure which one this would be well since we're driving the right side we would be more towards the northern part of Africa Northwestern part because because those countries drive on the right side but which one I have absolutely no idea it's not going to be Nigeria Congo Congo DRC let's go somewhere here maybe it's one of these these cities Kinshasa or and uh it was over one wait the one that drives on the right side I was sure they drive on the left oh interesting interesting one makes sense because the plates looked very much like Uganda and Kenya with yellow on the back white on the front I was just sure that Rwanda drives on the left side as well huh learning something new here after a brief investigation I found out that yarawanda Burundi drive both on the right side so yeah Uganda Kenya Tanzania they are kind of the most northern African countries that drive on the left so but let's move on finding something new learning every day that's why I like geogrister there's always something to learn which is nice uh next what do we have we have a very Sandy Sandy location again it's some kind of rectangular poles with some holes um some palm trees the license plates white license plates we said are we driving on I'm not entirely sure there's a chicken where would they have chicken hmm we have some tuk-tuks some palm trees some tuk-tuks they're kind of getting in a way um Nigerian Vibe so I'm thinking maybe Nigeria because I know they have their tuk-tuks they have some light license plates maybe it's just a country near Nigeria next to it or like Benin for example maybe this you can also get polls like these in Nigeria kind of these kind of ladder poles Brazilian style very similar to Brazilian pulse so I could see this maybe being Nigeria maybe something um next to it maybe let's go Benin let's go Benin Porto Novo let's say let's see I was just Nigeria damn it it was just Nigeria just Northern Nigeria the city of gusau I consider just going Nigeria but uh with those palm trees I didn't think it would be that Inland but I guess I was wrong I I usually associate palm trees with a bit more coastal areas than that but okay we move on oh this is pretty I'm getting big Georgian vibes from the first glance big Georgian Vibes with these these kind of towers as well the author is Michael bohor shivili the name is also very Georgian in my mind so I would 100 go Georgia here the country of Georgia not the state the country of Georgia very beautiful country I've been there once I loved it beautiful landscapes wonderful very welcoming people amazing food if you ever ever are in that area I'd highly suggest visiting Georgia um let's go I don't know where because we are just in some mountains here ish maybe there are a bunch of bunch of mountains here and it was okay it was more North quite North near the border with Russia so it is quite mountainous there near the national park okay very yeah very nice country I I would love to visit it again one day okay what do we have now uh Rick recipe is the author some photos being taken or something tick tocks maybe I think we have a mosque in the background there some license plates with blue down here uh which said are we driving on I think we're driving a little right side yeah we are doing the right side could this be with these balls kind of Turkish feeling poles could this be Cyprus I think they were drawing the left side because could this be just turkey then let's go turkey then because I think I think they did drive on the left side in Cyprus same with Malta it was just turkey yeah makes sense because we did see the Turkish poles there um I went a bit too East yeah it's really interesting how Malta and Cyprus are both islands and both are driving on the left side even though everyone else around them are driving the right side I made a short interesting video on my other channel about the driving sides I'll leave it in the info card if you wanna find out more about why why we're driving on the side that we are driving could a country switch its driving side what do we have here we have uh is that Cyrillic it looks like we have some Cyrillic yes I can't really read it but it looks like we have some non-russian letters some some eyes so maybe this be um Ukraine or Belarus again or or um not sure but plates can't really tell it's kind of glitched out a little bit it looks it might be Ukrainian maybe but with these Hills if it is Ukraine it would be kind of Southwestern Ukraine I think I could see these these Hills and these um this Flora being uh Southern Ukrainian maybe somewhere here because this part is quite quite hilly in Ukraine other other parts not so much so yeah I guess we go there let's see oh nice guess it was it was that mountainous part of Ukraine 62 kilometers away good guess good guess in total 17 and a half thousand points not bad at all if you played along let me know in the comments how you did and on the right side there will be another Play Along video playing the same map huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "image_not_available": [5],

another geoguessr video and in this one we are gonna play some maps that you my dear viewers have made if you have made a map you want me to try out leave it in the comments or join the Discord and post it there I'll soon make another video playing some more viewer Maps so I'll try to get through as many as I can the first map we're gonna try is called deceiving places so I guess it contains some deceiving places I would assume so the play along links will be as always in the description let's have one minute per run instead of a minute and a half just so it moves a bit quicker what do we have okay we have Bhutan we have you get a red license plates driving on the left side in Bhutan um what's deceiving here I'm not sure the language uh it even says Bhutan here Jung along I can't really see read the city name there's something muri something can't really see let's I guess glance and Bhutan maybe there is a city that stands out that could work yeah can't really sell maybe P maybe p uh yeah let's let's just leave it somewhere here in the middle oh it was all the way down here the I guess that's why it was deceiving huh because it was very close to the Border I thought it would be more flat there I know this area kind of here near gallip who is quite flat if you ever get a flat Bhutan it is basically either down here or I think there is some coverage maybe here as well but I'm not sure but okay let's move on uh sun is to the South well I recognize the country so I'm happy with that uh sun is to the South can't really see that sign in the distance there what is this AMS I can't really read Jack's something Jack's Town well this this has to be us right or these these North American polls um with this little knob on the top this feels kind of wintry at first I was thinking maybe something like like Utah but it might be even more North like Wyoming possibly I think the deception on this place is is how North in the US is let's go Wyoming oh oh it was Canada even ah very close to the Border these are some tricky tricky locations yeah I wouldn't say they are the most difficult ones but uh the the there definitely are some um interesting ones okay this is unofficial the author is Abdel Hadi bobekri okay which side are we driving on it looks like we are driving on the right side of the road can't see the license plate there you already know I'm not the best at landscape so uh but uh but but but my first thought was maybe somewhere like um India like around that area Bangladesh maybe but we're driving on the right side though um what could this be I I don't know I genuinely don't know um let's go this ever be it's not gonna be theirs like Coastal Syria with some Greenery there I don't know oh my rock oh Morocco okay yeah this was this was the definitely the most difficult round we've had thus far I was not thinking Morocco I was thinking like this area somewhere ah yeah yeah okay another official coverage I prefer official coverages because um because the quality is better and I know what to look for so we have some Spanish um do we have we have yellow reflectors yet yellow reflectors well in Spain first of all and in Chile but in Chile you wouldn't get a black Google car so I'm thinking maybe this is Argentina near Chile and looking at the landscape this definitely feels Southern to me with mountains big Big Snowy Mountains to kind of north and west uh somewhere here down here uh where are the roads here somewhere here ish maybe uh I feel it feels somewhere like in Southern Southern um South America for sure or even more south than that yeah and it was Argentinian site very close to Chile as I suspected just um even more South I noticed I was getting a bit bright there for a second I hope hope the camera issues have been fixed hopefully and let's move on oh okay person just chilling relaxing another unofficial coverage as you can see uh Sheena Lyden is the author here Sheena Lyden oh we can't trust the sun Direction so just purely judging by the landscape or could this be I was thinking maybe Europe maybe maybe not now that I look take a closer look some very high mountains snowy ones I don't know could this ever be New Zealand New Zealand is such a risky guess I don't have a better guess so might as well guess somewhere in New Zealand somewhere here ish where was it on the very border of the cheekistan and Afghanistan huh I wasn't thinking there that's for sure ah there were some definitely some deceiving locations in this map 11 000 points okay not bad if you do play these challenges along let me know in the comments how you are doing I always enjoy reading your uh results and the next map we're gonna play is airports of the world so quite a lot of locations and uh yeah so let's go good luck if you are playing along uh so yeah we are definitely in airports so knowing the place names might be helpful Capitan Carlos Martinez de pinilos uh well Spanish a Spanish-speaking country with a tuk-tuk um could this be Peru I know peruvians like their tuk-tuks any country names or city names that Del Peru the separu here yeah um so it seemed to be right on this being Peru but did it say The city which which name here is the city pinilos is pinilosa City or oh it says Peru there as well Del Peru here we go uh where is the airport um where is the airport oh gosh here is the airport pop carlosia and we are oh the time ran out I couldn't align it no one point I lost one point there damn it uh but okay I'm happy I'm happy that that I managed to at least find this one almost a perfect score but still 499 is also good also happy with that Safari's Fortress Africa we have a yellow back plate that I notice and we are wait which side is the steering wheel I think it's on the left I can't tell what this almost looks like it's in the middle um that's that's confusing any airport names or with Equity oh we have yellow front blades as well huh Equity oh gosh I don't know which set is the steering we'll go we gotta figure that out I think we are driving on the right side right it looks like windshield wipers are towards this side so oh I don't know I don't know the license plate colors uh in Africa if we're going on the right side it should be somewhere I guess we weren't driving on the right side I didn't know that Tanzania has yellow front blades but when I when I saw the yellow back plates I was at first thinking like Kenya or something but uh the driving side threw me off there I that's annoying okay we have some sort of a religious place maybe or or some sort of a temple author is undone shuja wait this should be airports is this an airport I would have never guessed looking at this place that this is an airport well definitely feels like it would be an Islamic country I would say but but but where this be like Iran by any chance somewhere in that area let's go Tehran where this is an airport here is a big Airport International Airport I don't know let's let's guess somewhere there hope for the best it was all Saudi Arabia Riyadh well I was kind of in the right area still got 2 000 points uh so what else what what do we have here I can't see any texts really waste the uh how no new test yeah airports do what language is this is that French where are we I don't know some of these outfits again feel kind of like like maybe maybe Northern Africa could this be Tunisia with some French I thought this might be French on this side but I can't really read um okay not actually bad not bad at all it was very border of more whoops it was it was very border of Morocco pretty small airport here I like that this map provides some challenge we have some de as I said we have a domain name so this should be Germany I would say Euro Wings Euro wings I don't see any City DSW DSW what what could be DSW do soldorf DSW well a bunch of German cities that start with a D are here I don't think it's dressed in Dusseldorf DSW could be Dusseldorf maybe maybe um where is there an airport here is it is there an airport in oh here is fluke half and Dusseldorf um no but it looks like it's the US not DSW what is DSW do you spoag Dortmund apparently we were in Dortmund wasn't too far though 64 kilometers away kind of it was in this area where I suspected it would be in total 14 000 that uh Second Round screwed me over the most where I couldn't figure the driving side unfortunately but other than that pretty good map next one is pretty self-explanatory apparently I've played it once before which I don't remember but it is sculptures and statues around the world um I don't think I know my sculptures and statues very well but let's see we have is that like some sort of like a heating uh ping where you heat I don't know or like a melt metal I don't know well if you know what this is let me know in the comments because I'm not sure it looks like we have Belgian license plates there kind of with a red tone uh we have some French oh we have some city names below Roy um where do we have these places um I don't see them oh no kuvin r99 where is r99 oh if I wish I had a bit more time is here 15 kilometers to the north wait what oh there we were she may yeah we were in chimei oh there was Charlotte how did I miss how do I miss places I knew Charlotte was a relatively big city you didn't see it oh is this the wheel is Tower in in Chicago we have the U.S flag we have the what I think is Chicago flag yeah I think um City boss yeah it says Chicago here on this side as well so so even if I didn't recognize that Tower there was a city clue here so uh Chicago uh the Willis Tower was oh gosh where was it it was somewhere here ish no uh Chicago Theater willista okay here it is and we can't trust the compass though we can't trust the compass but we have a lot of greenery here around and looks like we have some sort of big some theater or something so maybe Buckingham Fountain we have a fountain here ah it was a bit more it was the field museum that we saw ma oh man with fish the name of the statue checks out there we did have a man with a fish so I wonder what's the story behind that statue way is there some guy with a fish in Chicago [Music] somewhere here well I'm guessing that's that's where this is the Avenue of France blue blue um somewhere non do we have a street name um less machines I don't think that helps you know I don't see any street names let's try to align it I guess let's try to align the streets so it goes a little bit like that a little bit like that and it turns there uh well quite a lot of streets uh in in nant could be somewhere here turn a little turn there unlikely because there are tons of streets but let's keep it there maybe kind of oh my gosh it actually was there oh my gosh I could like it it's just a line the street that it turned out to be there Fair wait what was the statue though I didn't see a statue oh this was the statue oh that's a statue it's like some sub oh okay it is a statue Simpson with measuring tape I thought like a construction was happening here and there are like some some construction things just just laying on the ground but apparently that's a statue fair enough next what do we have oh we're doing some some Asian vibes look up I think that's a Buddha statue right correct me if I'm wrong I apologize if I get something wrong we have some Japanese I think yeah it looks like it so this definitely could be Japan somewhere but but but but but I don't know where I'm kind of more inclined to go like more towards Southern Japan just just going by The Vibes and I'm not sure in which which parts of Japan like Buddhism is more common than others if that maybe could help if I knew that but I I my guess would be somewhere kind of Southern Japan maybe or even more Southern okay near Oita what was it it was the usuki stone Buddha so so they were Buddhas Buddha statues okay cool cool I'm happy that I recognized that next we have do we we I do we have a front plate can't say it might be just like an empty slot now we do have a front light at least on this car oh my God that's a such an undurable chipmunk uh statue now where is this do we have we have a scent so we have miles National register of historic places Prairie Homestead Farm life I don't know where this would be though Ranch I don't know where this would be let's go something like uh Kansas I don't know Kansas let's let's see if it is somewhere there not too bad it was a bit more north than I thought it was uh this it was South Dakota interior what a great place name interior Badlands Ranch store oh my gosh you really need to zoom in to say anything there or Prairie Homestead as well yeah in total I did really good in this map 21.9 000 well admittedly it felt a bit easier than the previous ones but still I enjoyed it a lot last but not least we have a GOP refract the code map which all of the locations have something in common and I gotta figure out what it is so let's get going let's get going we will have the answer afterwards as well if I'm not sure but let's get let's see let's see if I can figure it out without looking what do we have the first location is by Kyle geese brecht Kyle geese sounds German the name um so could this be Germany I can't see any language but I could see this maybe being Germany the houses maybe could be German uh maybe and I wish I could see them like a bit closer some of them almost feel kind of Nordic so I was thinking maybe southern Sweden or Denmark let's go somewhere there um could be maybe Germany near Denmark somewhere in that area big water that means Sweden has a lot of lakes and Waters Denmark as well heal let's go let's go Northern Germany but but I wouldn't be surprised it was like a bit more north than that let's see oh my God I was way off I was way off I guess those houses were not European huh I mean I thought some of them looked kind of North American but they definitely saw some that looked very European as well so okay what do we have here the the place Jubilee Park campground on Wizard Lake okay we have a Wizard Lake they use a Wizard Lake okay and a location in Canada a campground and these Crack the Code maps you gotta pay attention to all these details to gonna try to remember as many as you can for the future ones nft the nft MFD melga Meister is it Austria let's have a look I can't read it I can't read that sign some political posters I wish I could read the language properly that would oh Peter okay that might be a good clue it's something Peter um so since it's a map made for me it might be something Peter I don't think it's uh Budapest though but but where would we go let's go a bit more South I was Budapest damage it was okay what do we have here uh so so what what's in common in the previous one Peter Peter wrote that's that's the only kind of uh thing that stood out for me on in this location so yeah maybe the first one had a wizard now it's Peter maybe kind of uh something like a geo geo guesser content creators Hobbit Hobbit uh many many of you might not know but there was a greedy Hobbit uh streamer like like a ninja guesser community so I think that might be a theme uh the the each location is kind of related to uh geoguessr Creator so we might get some some some other ones so but yeah this is us I don't know which uh or look at this be Canada we don't have front plates I think this would be us but uh where I now with no front plate looks kinda northernish to me maybe like Pennsylvania I don't know a little bit hilly so I think it could be maybe Pennsylvania let's see uh Colorado but Colorado should have front plates I think maybe it was a car up from out of state let's zoom in just in case maybe we find something else that I missed the Hobbit Street Shield Street Landmark apartments yeah but I think I think the theory that it's Geo guesser a content creator related is a good one what do we have here Baron Street Jack Street Jack like uh Jack sex at geography maybe he he does some geographer content as well we made a video together I'll leave it in in the info card top right corner so scooter could be Jack Jack uh sexy geography related this this location a reference we are driving the letter this black part of a hole was it Brisbane uh I need to practice my Australian streaks but I would go Brisbane probably here um I don't really see anything else that uh would help just just that blacks black thingy on the pole I think it might have been like Queensland or Brisbane specific yeah it was Brisbane okay so I do remember something from Australia so that is good I'd love to visit Australia one day but it's so far away unfortunately well hopefully one day okay and what's the this is the last round what do we have here um I don't know what that shape is we have a dark yellow plates well at least one of them um one dark yellow play I do not know what these plates are kind of blue with yellow on the top yellow with blue on the top okay I'm confused there appears to be some blue on the plates I wish I knew them but yeah I don't I don't I don't uh recycling only flood and Flood Brothers oh gosh I I have absolutely no the judging by this like the general Vibes I would go kind of North East we only get one yellow plate here so I don't think it would be New York maybe like a neighboring state Connecticut or something oh Chicago geographer I should have thought about that like Io Io Street perfect Iowa Street in Chicago nice so yeah I am pretty sure that these locations where geogues are content creator related 12 000 points not too bad not too bad but let's see if my guess is correct all the locations give clues about people featured on my channel oh specifically on my channel okay makes sense so Geo wizard Chicago geographer Jackson geography greedy Hobbit and myself I do have all of these wonderful content creators featured on my channel I'll leave them in the info card when the round was mentioned I hope you enjoyed this video on the right side there will be another one where you can play along and test your skills huge thanks to all of the patrons and YouTube members for supporting this channel I hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/13flYBX8PvCVIlJp",

to play a map called I saw the sign but it's not what you expect if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button and here we go the idea of this map is that we are gonna see some well-known city names or something but they are not what you think they will be somewhere else so let's go let's go the challenge links will be in the description if you want to play along you can play along without the pro account with the free one free one will do but make sure to play before watching this video I delayed so we are driving here on the left side bit this is not Adelaide not not the one not the one uh you would think is here we are driving the left side though but the outer lines are yellow which would make me say that this is South Africa I don't know where there is Adelaide in South Africa to be honest Adelaide contact Point what contact Point contact point with what this is a border Road 63 begins here Road 63 Adelaide looking like this porn up River Road 63 oh I don't know where that is 66 is here 65. wait we had 63 right 63. oh gosh I wish I had more time I wish I had more time I think it might be somewhere oh gosh there was Adelaide sometimes these Road number existence could be really tricky because I saw Road 68 here and 67 but 63 is all the way down here turns out but okay at least I recognize the country let's move on hopefully we recognize some other places Valencia Municipality of a Valencia aha this is Philippines I didn't know that in that in Philippines there is a Municipality of Valencia we have water to the south in Philippines you can see these orange poles a lot this kind of dark dark yellowish line in the middle concrete roads Municipality of Valencia huh I don't know if municipalities how easy they are to see on the map if you can even see them so the water is to the South and I don't see any land in the distance and the road Direction the road goes okay the road goes like like a little diagonally could it be somewhere here maybe I don't know those municipalities unfortunately I think the road aligns there but the Philippines has so many islands this really could be almost anywhere so I think this is a decent guess let's hope for the best not bad okay not too bad did it say Valencia somewhere here ah there what there it was very small though very very small yeah really difficult to find for sure so next round the stop what is this very interesting structure some sort of uh statue I don't know where is the sign the sign mentioning the city or oh this might be an updated coverage it looks like it is a new coverage so I guess in an older coverage there used to be some sort of a city name but not anymore not that I can see at least well this is Italy either way because we have these small front plates with blue on both sides let's see at the architecture does this feel Northern does this feel Southern it doesn't feel very Southern to me let me tell you this feels I would go kind of kind of more towards north here maybe not to Northern but I mean I don't know let's say something like arizo maybe I don't know not many Clues here besides the architecture so I guess let's go somewhere there maybe a bit more North even oh it was Rome really oh I wasn't thinking Rome there what what was that uh place name that we didn't see oh the Canada Road okay we were on the Canada Road apparently oh interesting yeah in Latvia you also can get some some other um weird cities named after other countries I think we had like Paris somewhere or something like that Perth oh I know where there is Perth um in the UK Perth is up here I hope that's the Perth they might have multiple perths in the UK I'm not sure but we do have yellow yellow back blades driving the left side University City I don't know if this is the University City what what's the direction of the road kind of almost vertical so we're entering Perth uh we are entering Perth from the south to our South we have some big roads going all over the place um so would we be somewhere here maybe I think this is a good shout I think this is a good shout because there's a lot of weird roads going there and the road seems to be baby turning to the left in the distance there here so I think this is the my best guess here let's hope for the best is that a 5k it is a 5K let's go let's go oh my gosh it feels good too too 5K location because after the previous rounds some of them weren't that good Wyoming shopping Village okay so a different a smaller Wyoming I guess medical and dental center so we are driving on the left side here we have a yellow plate which would make me think maybe New South Wales we have a couple of yellow plates so yeah I think New South Wales is a good shout because in New South Wales you can get some yellow plates um Wyoming shopping mall uh I don't know about the poles that's one thing I haven't really studied for um Australia uh or the polls this polls can also be quite helpful what does it say Wyoming I guess let's have a look at can we see we found Wyoming in in in in New South Wales at first I was thinking that the shopping mall is just called Wyoming but there is Wyoming on the street name as well so it's on the street sign so I guess the whole city is called Wyoming but uh New South Wales is pretty big so the chance of finding it in a few seconds quite low there it was oh yeah yeah there is Wyoming well unless you know it it's really really hard to find because you need to zoom in a lot until it even shows up and then you gotta V gotta notice it as well okay let's see the first game is up 21.2 000 I think that's a really good start had some better on some worse rounds but in total I think it was pretty good let's go for another one again Link in the description if you're playing along uh let me know in the comments how you are doing if you manage to beat me or not Virginia I don't know what Ben window means but this should be Brazil yeah we have this Brazilian pole oh gosh where in Brazil would we be Brazil is so tricky to to like figure out the area usually at least for me unless I see some phone numbers or Road names and Road numbers or piranha points are always helpful but I don't see any piranha points here unfortunately well I don't think there's any point of trying to find Virginia in Brazil if I don't even know which area this would be I am thinking that either it might be somewhere like here ish or way more North here ish or here ish I don't know let's let's go state of Sao Paulo maybe somewhere here is there Virginia there that we see no ah there it was it was was I in the right State I was one state over oh my there's no chance you could find that Virginia unless you know it it doesn't even show up until you zoom in right on top of it that was a really difficult round there okay we have some um South a South African flag that might be a regional flag but I don't know Bethlehem yeah [Music] um I don't know where there is Bethlehem in South Africa just going by The Vibes I was thinking maybe somewhere like around Johannesburg maybe a bit South Southwest we can try to find oh wait that was completely random but I found Bethlehem um is this the the Bethlehem so what's the road Direction okay Road direction is a little bit almost almost vertical it could work what what was the the the thing sups I don't know what that is Bethlehem sups to our West or to our East to our East Bethlehem shops ah there there it was OH sups police station ah well we did have a police car there okay I'm very happy with this uh Bethlehem was was findable actually it is visible from quite quite a distance out so I like that some of these rounds are easier some are more difficult so you never know what you get Marrakesh restaurant Marrakesh Employment Insurance Center so what coach country this is this looks like um Malaysia yeah signs you get in Malaysia I think we have that black um thingy on the pole which would indicate that we are in the mainland we're in the mainland oh and we have these double Towers uh that you get in Kuala Lumpur I think this this is these are like famous towers two hours south can we find those Towers first of all I don't remember what was their name or where could you find them but uh can we find them we're all alone poor I don't I don't see those Towers oh yeah we are no north of the towers but I can't find the towers let's go somewhere here ish maybe a Patronus twin tower is a where do I find them in the last second so Hotel America should be maybe somewhere here ish okay not bad almost a 5k okay we were a bit closer to those Towers than I thought but uh I recognize the famous place I can't believe it I usually can't can't tell the famous places are mosqueva well mosqueva is Moscow but well this isn't Moscow well not the usual Moscow this is Poland so uh these are polish poles with the holes not going all the way to the ground that's a way you can tell the Poland apart from Hungary because in Poland the holes don't go all the way to the ground so this is Moscow somewhere in Poland well this seems like a pretty small small town so it's a very very unlikely that I will find it we might as well try we have 40 seconds to spare uh looks quite flat the buildings um I don't know maybe somewhere here ish yeah I'm not finding it at all let's let's just guess somewhere kind of in the middle maybe a bit more North somewhere oh no it was more South near watch and there was mosque as I thought it's a super super tiny Place unlikely that that you find it there done Mark so we have Denmark in Swede and this would be Sweden with these short dashes on the sides of Road yellow signs that you see in Sweden as well speed limit signs Don Mark well it does feel quite Southern to me I would say Don Mark so let's zoom in on the southern Sweden maybe we can find Don Mark maybe near Denmark who knows Don Mark I might be wrong about my Southern Vibes but but that was my first thought when I see it I thought it could be quite Southern here it might be a very very small town that I or it's not self or I missed it I don't know let's let's see I guess I'll keep it somewhere here ah okay it wasn't nearly as South as I thought Don there is done oh my it's again super super tiny how am I supposed to find it it's so tiny hiding hiding behind jokes okay let's do the summary it didn't feel as good as the first game but the points are more the points are 22 and 0.1 000 so let's go third third time is the charm let's see how we do here North Pole Middle School okay so I'm guessing this probably is quite Northern uh one way so this would be the us because in Canada it doesn't say one way on the sun I think my first thought was Alaska maybe but uh do we have yellow plates there it looks like at least one of the cars does have a yellow plate so can we find North Poland in Alaska maybe um oh North fall here uh here it is North Pole uh North Pole Middle School surely that is on the map a high school middle school like that elementary middle high school and middle school all have different buildings um Middle School wait middle school is to our South wait what are we like oh I couldn't align it a damn it uh where we where are we here here here nah there ah I couldn't align it in time lost on two points there ah yeah yeah yeah okay let's move on let's move on what do we have we have a Rome Rome Roma Valencia Valencia so we should be near Valencia can we find Rome near Valencia because it does save Valencia on that sign as well Valencia Valencia La Florida I found Florida but but can't find really Rome yet El Romani kind of similar but not really the same uh let's get somewhere there I couldn't really find it in time unfortunately oh there it is super tiny oh my gosh how do you even find it I need to zoom in Incredibly Close did it say the roll number may be somewhere that I missed not sure uh what do we have we have some Cyrillic we have ulitza dot are you so Russia uh what city is this um Italy well which have to be in Italy eight one two eight one two eight one two oh gosh it was eight one two like um Saint Petersburg I think 812 phone code might have been Saint Petersburg but I'm not entirely sure oh what's what's the real name bolshoy prospects like a big Prospect or showy Prospect what's the road Direction it does go kind of like that um of course I might be wrong respect oh oh respect restaurant Italy there was like a restaurant Italy oh I don't see restaurant Italy but it was a perfect score oh my God I found boyfriend Prospect at the last the last few seconds there and just guessed oh my gosh knowing the area codes the phone codes in Russia can really help because I was thinking h12 was somewhere around Saint Petersburg area by bonnen wait what's what's this name here Florida oh okay okay visiting Florida here this this should be just um Norway right where is there Florida in uh Norway this this person seems very cold this this area looks very cold bad oh it says Bergen better again like a Bergen airport to main B well I know where Bergen is so is there Florida nearby let's have a look I I couldn't find Florida let's oh it was super I wouldn't say Center oh it's just just the stop but like a train stop or tram stop is called Florida I was looking for like an area called Florida or a city but it was was just a bus stop called that way okay still really good score I'm happy about that Scandinavia well I have a feeling this might not be Norway this time what do we have we have the blue strip there on the car pompierre smooth what is this getting kind of Balkan Vibes I was thinking maybe Romania not entirely sure oh yeah these are these are Romanian yield signs with super super thick red uh border there so this should be Romania we have some water to the West kind of Southwest um and the Navy I don't think the place is called Scandinavia is probably just the hotel with water is this a river it looks like it could be a river um so this River may be somewhere maybe we are somewhere there uh this is a very risky guess going super super Easter in Romania but uh oh it was even more East oh super super East yeah like a very touristy area with that beach there I I thought this game went really well let's see 24.6 000 oh this is this is amazing this is a really really good game don't forget to press that like button and let me know in the comments how you did if you were playing along on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy and huge thanks to all of the

play a geographer map containing the most beautiful locations all around the world if you enjoy these playlock videos press that like button and here we go so here is the map it's called a stunning world and the average score is quite low so it is a difficult map so good luck to everyone who is playing along the play along links will be in the description as always and make sure to play them before watching this video so don't spoil anything so what do we have we have some people here on the tree toyota we have a license plate without any flags or anything so not very helpful very dry very rocky place since this is unofficial coverage we cannot trust the sun i really have no clue where this would be my first thought was maybe kind of middle east maybe something like pakistan afghanistan somewhere there maybe africa could this be africa maybe this open door would maybe imply that we are driving on the right side of the road so so somewhere here would work maybe i'm gonna go afghanistan somewhere in this area maybe let's see it was africa mauritania huh i didn't consider africa but but yeah that was a really difficult round ugh not the greatest start only 32 points but hopefully the other rounds are better maybe once it loads oh very beautiful a big city oh gosh what is this city though very beautiful bridge oh i feel like we've had this bridge in geo detective i don't remember though it was such a long time ago i'm thinking was it it says rio tinto i was thinking wasn't this bridge in asia i might be misremembering though because it was a long time ago i was thinking something like malaysia maybe but taylor smith elizabeth youth south perth south perth oh it says south perth so would we be in perth south perth is there a bridge one of these bridges could it be maybe somewhere here maybe i have no idea but let's let's hope for the best it was perth let's go that that that uh but very there really helped with the say saying south perth oh how can these super rural locations very beautiful oh i feel like this might be some sort of a famous place i feel like i've seen this this kind of gate before but i would not know where it is could this be like grand canyon or something in the u.s we have some other people taking photo spheres up there i feel like this might be near grand canyon because i'm getting very similar vibes to that area so the grand canyon was yeah somewhere here in arizona so i think i will go we'll guess in arizona here i could see this being somewhere there easily but i could see this being somewhere completely else as well possibly but let's just guess there and see okay not bad utah not too bad kind of kind of in that vicinity of grand canyon let's go i'm very happy with that oh what do we have we have an island clearly not a big island with a small city with red roofs huh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah which side are we driving can we tell i cannot really tell i kind of assume we are driving on the right side here but i i can't really verify it we have a small airport as well i mean which makes sense where would this be could this be one of i don't know this be like this island maybe would that work no the airport isn't on the very coast here one of these islands i don't see an airport even here this feels european with these roofs it feels very mediterranean to me so i'm thinking it might be somewhere in this area maybe maybe it's one of the um croatian islands one of these ones possibly but which one i i have no clue i mean these ones i mean these are these croatian islands oh it was more in the ocean huh okay it was azores i did consider azores but i thought the uh roofs would be a bit different in azores ah yeah yeah yeah yeah kind of kind of the right vibes but still lost a lot of points there unfortunately that that's very beautiful mountains here i'm always thinking could could this be alps maybe some people climbing these mountains as well maybe this is somewhere like like near everest mount everest somewhere in that area i don't know the more i look at this the more this doesn't feel like alps to me the more more it feels like this this mountain range here yeah i think i will go kind of nepal maybe maybe maybe somewhere somewhere there maybe china maybe india okay let's go i i guess i should have guessed closer to mount everest that was a misjudgment for me i guess it would have been a safer bet to guess somewhere there because i guess more more climbers are in that area in total 12 988 points which is better than average so i'll take it i'll take it uh let's go for another one again link in the description of course oh very pretty yeah the the title isn't lying the map the map title the locations are indeed stunning i have to agree but they are difficult as well because as my longtime viewers know i'm not the greatest with these kind of landscape views landscape guesses i usually rely on some signs or polls or or something man-made the architecture i'm not sure what it feels like feels like an island maybe one of the caribbean islands maybe i know they can get quite mountainous there in that area very deep deep valley here um what could it be somewhere dominica now martinique maybe somewhere martinique all of these islands are really mountainous so might as well just just pick one and pray well it was an island it was reunion was it oh wow okay i didn't know reunion had such a big um big kind of valley there interesting wow okay learning something new here interesting yeah the world is so so big and diverse this almost looks the same [Laughter] very similar to the previous one the house is very similar again could this be the second reunion could this be another reunion right there because the mountains look really similar kind of there are some trees quite edgy i don't i guess i'll go somewhere here-ish these mountains we have some houses but it's definitely a very very small town so it might be one of these small tiny towns maybe might as well guess there i don't have a better guess just the mountains look very similar to the previous round oh my god and i guess the author's name was ivan but i mean people travel so you can't really rely on authors names too first game was much better oh god oh no the author's name is aldo aldo escobar oh sounds latin american um big mountains coastal so i'm thinking yeah maybe colombia maybe ecuador could be mexico could be anywhere in between really all of these countries are quite mountainous we have a house there hmm this is tricky this is tricky for some reason the the landscape the mountains still feel kind of more mexican to me than colombian ecuadorian but i might be very very very wrong or it could be could be guatemala maybe although this coast is is not that illy is it el salvador maybe this whole this coast seems quite hilly let's go with salvador why not kind of in the middle as well just for hedging purposes but i could see this being el salvador itself too let's go there how was that spain how was that spain this house did not look spanish at all it looked so so latin american seriously i i think this might be one of my worst games on my on my channel honestly so what do we have we have the author's name is owen gallagher gallagher which side are we driving on can't really tell i think we're driving the right side the roofs are kind of dark we have some dark roofs some brownish roofs looking at the roofs i am feeling maybe something like belgium possibly germany somewhere in that area maybe if you're going on the right side um we have some sort of a bridge in the distance some river splitting in two [Music] could it be somewhere here is there a river maybe somewhere here the river splits in two here um would that fit i'm not sure maybe uh we don't have too much time to align things but i i could see it being somewhere here it's not going to be brussels the river antiverb i'm going to keep it in induceborg and see and it was it was the netherlands okay well i was right i write about the area at least at least got some decent points in this game oh yeah here was that river splitting into yeah as well fair enough fair enough okay and the last round hopefully oh gosh it's difficult it's again some waterfall and we're in the middle of a forest and the author's name is heinkel elwyn hinco elwynn people people are showing peace signs having a nice picnic very beautiful place to have a picnic i have to say i i i i don't know where this is this could be literally anywhere honestly i'm i'm i'm thinking could this be something like costa rica maybe no probably not honduras ecuador i feel like it might be in this area maybe maybe not let's go let's just see oh my god it was myanmar oh no the score was below average this time 4.5 000 points oh no okay let's go the third time's the charm i hope i really hope oh what do we have here oh okay some some very beautiful cliffs do we have the european strip on those cars we might have it it's hard to see we are driving on the right side of the road with this architecture i am thinking maybe portugal feels very portuguese the roads and everything can't really see the plate properly do they have portuguese strip on the right side possibly just going purely by the architecture we have these little roofs you often see in southern portugal these like chimneys i think they are or this might be some sort of an island somewhere i don't think this feels like azores though so i would go maybe mainland portugal somewhere like coast somewhere here that would be my main guess nice let's go three kilometers oh my god let's go oh that's exactly what i needed after that previous game it's literally in this round i got four points than in the whole previous game okay great start great start for this game let's hope we can keep it up oh no what is this now very very dark soil that we see here very dark soil very red the houses well definitely not european we see a lot of blue roofs whenever i see this many blue roofs i'm thinking asia but with this red soil where in asia would this be though the mountains have a lot of trees here very green could this be somewhere like indonesia i don't know maybe one of these islands here i'm not sure how red they are but just just i know they can be mountainous and and yeah i'm thinking maybe somewhere here just just the pure gas let's see ah there new caledonia huh well i wasn't i was kind of in the ballpark but still very far away so got very few points unfortunately okay this might be gettable wait what do we have here we have whoa a lot of lot of titles for this person dr where is this person from bombay bombay was i think mumbai but it doesn't mean that we are there though just just the just the stand says it the this script with this vertical line could fit a lot of english so touristy place possibly so mumbai would make sense i think yeah i guess let's go there and then hope for the best okay we were in a sanctuary surely this was misplaced we're in the middle of a city we weren't in like a sanctuary with four houses around surely this is misplaced no i i don't think but okay let's move on no is this a broken broken location oh no this is a broken location what are we gonna do i had some really good guesses i don't want to restart i think i'll keep this in but let's just guess let's guess in antarctica if you're playing duels it's a good etiquette to whenever there's a broken location to guess antarctica so let's guess antarctica and uh yeah this is unfortunate i hate when these these broken locations happen okay let's move on oh we had this location before a repeat so where was it where was it so i went i went middle east somewhere but it turned out to be mauritania right um i don't remember where exactly it might have been somewhere here-ish i was up there eh let's do the summary 13 000 let's go even even with that antarctica guess there let me know in the comments how you did if you played along and what you think of this map i thought it was pretty cool some interesting some challenging locations for sure and on the right side there will be another video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel you are the reason i can do this full time so i do appreciate you all very much i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you all in the next video ", "image_not_available": [4], "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/r6Qz3AvkbDy7rriA",

on the easier side because every location will have some sort of a clue if you enjoy these playlong videos don't forget to press that like button and here we go we'll be playing a map called geodetective world we've played it before and people seem to enjoy it i enjoyed it as well so the play along links will be in the description as always make sure to play them before watching this video so don't spoil anything okay we start we're starting with unofficial coverage here because you can get some unofficial ones as well so dot nz uh so new zealand restaurant so parking kerikeri mission station these um these these red signs giving me southern uh new zealand vibes but i might be wrong kerikeri mission station i guess kerikeri is the place of the location why mission station is this some sort of an island no kitty cat is there kerikeri somewhere here oh kerry kerry oh my god it's completely the opposite side as i was thinking i was looking uh south at first luckily it was large enough to find we are next to some small lake to the east the road direction is like that okay no not there not their kitty catty mission station oh too little time mission house 499 ah close close though if i had a bit more time i could have aligned it found this this road which aligns still pretty pretty happy that i found kerikeri at least oh yeah here we go an unofficial coverage this time so it could be anywhere we see some arabic luggage lockers of the promotion prevention of vices uh where would this be seems very uh middle eastern country i would say some sort of a mosque way to king abdullah gate king abdullah oh wait this is mecca isn't it well they're showing mecca doesn't really mean that this is saudi arabia does it because mecca is like a holy place for for muslims so this doesn't mean we're in in the saudi arabia although the colors would great dark green with white would fit with uh saudi arabian flag so maybe this is sorry very fancy fancy looking buildings king abdullah gate i don't know i don't know i've are we in mecca where was i just saw mecca where did it disappear mecca here oh my gosh are we in mecca though i'm not sure about that would they show mecca in mecca i think they would show makeup probably in some other cities so i'm very much not sure if we are here but let's go somewhere here ish king some we did have skiing something but i don't know let's let's go somewhere here oh i very much wasn't sure but it is a 5k i mean the road aligned it looked like pedestrian road this was that fancy building that we saw okay fair enough i'm happy with the 5k let's go let's go round number three oh the language looks very turkish from the first glance let's look around where would we be so we have a mosque the eb could be turkish something bank maybe phone number starting with two one i believe we're in istanbul no if zero five zero five was a mobile number i believe if i'm not mistaken so i'm thinking is wait it's four four here that's the aria i don't know this might not be istanbul maybe maybe the phone numbers are betraying me gazetsky i haven't seen anything saying istanbul the clues that this is turkey are everywhere but the clues about the city i'm not so sure um just based on the phone numbers i want to go like um istanbul that area but led led is led city what is it [Music] did it say bolo somewhere maybe this is the next one we have the this is syrian flag right with the two stars i think syria had two stars on their flag those those many of these flags have red white and black so they all couldn't mix up in my head which one had stars i think egypt had eagles was it a man who which which had nothing they all look so similar but where would we be in syria most things are in arabic hotel albuston is the only thing i can actually read here and there is another big building which i can't read what it is can we i think we can trust the compass because even though it's unofficial coverage i think the author of this map has chosen uh locations where the compass aligns properly i i think i think that's the case so hotel what was it hotel al busan al-buston maybe it's not damascus i mean the damascus is a huge city okay it was damascus just to stop not where i guessed oh albustan was there just just had to zoom in even more tricky tricky tricky huh but okay not too bad of a score at least at least oh gosh what is this what are these oh i can't see the flag properly come on there's so many countries with this this type of flag is it honduras is it something else oh we have a star oh is it argentina then with a star oh okay well that doesn't really make things easier because argentina is a big country so something about the act of independence here is some sort of a museum so would this be buenos aires i don't know where they signed the act of independence desti destin something is that a city named destilon i'm not really getting uh buenos air's vibes from from here but maybe you're just not very central they still on well has to be somewhere here right ah it was okay it was not buenos aires but it wasn't rosario either it was san miguel de tucuman didn't see this this city name anywhere how much it did we got 22 and a half thousand points not too bad let's go for another game good luck good luck oh this bridge um was it rotterdam bridge or or am i tripping where are we we have a lot of different country flags from all over the world world rotterdam yeah it says rotterdam i remember daughter the bridge rotterdam which bridge is it though there are a couple of bridges in rotterdam this one van von breenbrook will be somewhere here where the bridge is to our south um so are we here we are next to some some some monument some war monument and and like probably a hotel with a lot of flags the boy could we hear the bug it looks like that kind of no i don't know what it means the black but uh i think it might be it and what would that be we have some sort of a big building with i think the shape matches yeah i think we should be here i think i think nice okay a bit more west but pretty good pretty good oh what do we have now official coverage we have this antenna well let's try to figure out without the antenna municipality of guyan guaynabol why not so we don't have the front plates which is a good clue and english no front plates english and some spanish are all good clues that this would be puerto rico so some sort of a plane we are on a roundabout with the guayanabo guaynabo univer uh not university municipality where would that be why not surely it is somewhere on the map i can't pronounce these names i'm sorry guayama municipality is here but i don't see uh [Music] guaynabo i don't see it i mean these are the municipalities right i think i think um i i don't see it let's maybe guess now that oh my gosh at the la of course at the very last second i find it come on and here is here is the city with that name as well oh so annoying when you find it the location is literally the last second oh yeah well still a close guess so that's nice we have a flag here which looks like a venezuelan flag no with yeah it says venezuela with those stars on the flag museum [Music] something they call calabazo it's calabasa a city maybe calabazo let's have a look cala bozo i mean most of the cities are kind of more more close closer to the coast so shouldn't be too difficult to scan over calla bozo a lot of cities starting with a c that i notice i don't know what's the first that first name might be the city name but they can't really read it and just see color bozo which might not even be a city i mean very pretty location some sort of a museum or art museum but but but but but but but i do not know where kabhima's maybe it says cup no it doesn't say kabimas let's just guess in karakos kind of in the middle um calabasa was oh my gosh it was noticeable it was small but it was noticeable how do i always miss these places color bozo here it was ah it definitely was findable uh media expert we have polish signs so we're in poland yeah this is this polish kind of crest vivo calypso alkali so it's not gonna be city we have some some trains going on [Music] [Music] something oh god i can't speak today i don't know i don't know is is it a city maybe dwarzet dwarzet um and we are next to a big shopping mall vivo vivo shopping mall and a roundabout to the west vivo where is vivo vivo come on i really don't have much time oh no vivo vivo vivo vivo vivo ah there there was vivo oh we did have railroad ah i forgot that we had railroad damn it i mean it's still a good guess but you always want to get that 5k especially yeah i did see those those railroad tracks i guess the completely opposite side of the city but that's a bit annoying but okay uh happens uh what watershed so we have english here richard something frank vassak carmen so we have a bunch of kind of kind of these these memorial plates here okay we have an american flag some sort of a historical place but what we have yellow plates alaska alaskan plates okay sporting goods so we are in alaska uh near water where something historical happened anchorage maybe with the the capital of alaska was not anchorage right we were it was was it fair back no oh by the way i made a video recently mentioning fairbanks on one of my other channels check it out in the in the top right corner where i talk about the longest road in the world so if that sounds interesting go check it out we are next to the water to the north i don't know this doesn't really feel like anchorage but i didn't really see any city names pronscana yeah i'm not sure let's let's leave it in anchorage maybe and then and oh maybe it's kind of more western somewhere here oh no there's more eastern even cordova did we have cordova somewhere once you know it's called cordova one of these words is cordova cordova history let's see let's see 23.8 000 better than the first time let's do one last game and and maybe we can beat it maybe maybe not we'll see what is that flag big and uh i don't know my first thought was nunavutz but would it be nunavut this road feels dutch so we are in the netherlands um coastal oh gosh so many place names oh deck the cog something something this luffy slufter five kilometers so many the information overload oh god so we have the coast too well yeah as expected to the northwest which doesn't help too much any any any de corg the cog is the the place name maybe the cog or does the cog mean just like a pole i don't know the cork the cog the cog let's see if there is a decog somewhere decor not well not at least not a big place not that i can find so oh the cog they called the the cog here right it kind of splits into this path the cog why is there is oh one o but notice there is the cork with two o's i don't know i hope it is it kind of works right it splits in two there's a small pathway there with a cute doggo by the way oh my god how did i miss that cutie oh my gosh such an adorable doggo oh and it is a 5k oh this is such a good round such a perfect round with a doggo and a 5k and everything you might might wish for what do we have here now this is italy with these um short front plates we are next to water as you might notice water this is official coverage water is to our north east um water to the north east the city's cocktail lounge restaurant doesn't help at all las armento diaz armando di as well i don't know where he was from unfortunately armando diaz i don't see any city clues which is unfortunate well okay let's let's just align it and hope for the best then because looks very very um warm so the water is to our north east looking very warm body maybe we have something there no it's not there mmm brindisi no could it be remini no um i don't think it aligns uh palermo palermo maybe is it the the doesn't the line know i don't know let's leave it in palermo maybe but i don't think it aligns it was it was body what oh my god that's just annoying i thought i thought i didn't see those those little thingies on on on the map so i kind of dismissed it so close yet so far uh okay round number three uh what do we get here okay something something what country is this indonesia i am thinking this might be indonesia maybe or maybe maybe like something like timor leste somewhere in that area oh no we do have indonesian flags yeah polish something okay if polish something near near water big big big river how difficult it would it be to find a city in a city in indonesia right indonesia is such a small country something parliament [Music] i could not find it i could not find oh pauldembong om it's a i thought i had heard about it but i was just i was just looking for something coastal let's forget that round ever happened let's move on uh fish fish fisk mark well i think that means fish market this d letter with a stripe in the middle huh let's be iceland i think they they have that letter in icelandic language maybe oh yeah we have iceland iceland flag okay so we have is is any of those a cities city name grims er we have water to the north i think this biscuit marador might be the city name because i see the a bunch of other cities ending with door well i don't know how to properly pronounce it but uh the fisk maya do mother duer might be the city name then is what i'm thinking i did not find it i did not let's get somewhere here but what what i i didn't even know that island existed sandvik did it say sandvik it didn't even say sandvik anywhere how could i have known it was there and i guess now we know the compass still might not be aligned because we had water to the north i thought maybe in this map they have locations with a lined compass but apparently not so what do we have we have some arabic here what is that flag oh gosh what was that flag i'm bad with flags american eye and retina center i don't remember the flag yeah this is the first round i genuinely don't know what country this is i've definitely seen it before but what what flag was it what what could it be it's not algeria it's not libya not lebanon i don't know what it even could be iran doesn't have a sun in the middle of a fly the colors would be similar but iraq it was the kurdish flag wasn't it oh my we've had it before in one of my videos as well i just forgot i knew i had seen it but didn't connect in my mind just just now afterwards turned out to be the worst game of the day 19.7 000 if you played along let me know how you did in the comments below and on the right side there will be another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind

another video and this is going to be another difficult one because we are going to play a map that pros like to play which is called a skewed world in this map you play it with no moving pending and zooming and you are faced away from the road so you see bushes maybe some signs if you get lucky don't forget to press that like button and here we go so let's set it to one minute per round no moving panning zooming and the links will be in the description if you want to play it along okay this one shouldn't be too difficult because we have some language luckily with these circular letters and this kind of nature very tropical looking dark soil i would go with sri lanka you can get this script in india as well but this coverage looks too too too high quality for india because in india usually the coverage isn't that high quality doesn't feel very hilly so it could be northern could be kind of here coastal-ish um maybe let's go more northern why not let's go somewhere there not too bad not too bad 98 kilometers away let's go let's keep going next round oh this is more tricky here what do we have here we have these yellow reflectors that we see here and this pole this slim pole with only one uh this this separator would make me think chile would make me think chile and and i think the trees would fit i know you can get yellow reflectors in spain but also in chile that's that's a fun fact as chile sometimes we'll have also spanish bollards interestingly enough where would it be looks quite green with the mountains to the i mean let's go somewhere here i feel like it might be maybe those are these mountains to the north that we see okay not too bad not too bad at all i got the right area very happy about that 80 kilometers away great start for the challenge oh now this is more tricky here what we have we have definitely north america i feel the houses feel very north american question is whether it's usa or canada and um where we have a front plate that's one thing that we have i noticed that we don't have the split windows i don't think or maybe there are some split windows behind the trees oh i don't know it definitely might be canada definitely could be i want to go kind of bismarck let's go canada screw it let's go canada let's go regina let's go there because i really don't know it okay it was canada i got that right i'm happy that i got the country oh god what is this now the sun is kind of south ish i think oh gosh oh gosh well this is this is a typical typical skewed world location there are some bushes and we see some sand that's about it i don't know i don't know this feels maybe european maybe feels quite bare are those mountains no those are just clouds i don't know let's go bulgaria i don't know brazil huh let's let's have a look around oh gosh well if i could have looked around yeah yeah it's brazil but secure world is a difficult map for a reason but let's keep going let's keep going oh we get a bollard these bollards you get in you get very similar ones in north macedonia and ecuador now which one would it be is this north macedonia or ecuador i was kind of leaning more towards ecuador with these these kind of plants we see some uh can you see it behind my head there these kind of kind of sharp looking leaves i feel like they would be more ecuadorian both of the countries are quite mountainous so that doesn't help too much but i i think i would go more ecuador just yeah because of the plants the sun country we can't really tell economy it's somewhere in the sky so let's go kind of in the middle east of the ecuador okay it was ecuador just more south but i'm happy about the guests 15 000 points not too bad not too bad yeah messed up that fourth round third one could have been a bit better but other than that i am quite happy let's go for the next game hopefully we do okay this time we have oh gosh gosh what is this now we have yellow small yellow flowers on these bushes my first thought was like scotland or something but or or somewhere in that area that's just my vibe but there isn't really much are there's houses i can't even tell if those are houses in the distance or something else yeah i guess let's go with the vibe if there is nothing else to go by just follow the follow the gut instinct because sometimes it will be right let's go somewhere there well not this time brazil huh of course if i could have looked around yeah yeah that's a rough start but okay oh we have a 60 sign 60 speed limit with four bolts i'm not sure if that helps feels quite european but i i'm not sure which country this would be looks like generation four coverage which eliminates a few countries i'm thinking maybe bulgaria could this be or romania bulgaria romania hungary maybe just just by going by the vibes um it looks quite flat so maybe let's go northern bulgaria because it is more flat there and also it's closer to romania so let's go somewhere there ish hungary okay well it was one of the countries that i considered okay not too bad i'm i'm happy with this guys oh now here my first thought was definitely scotland with these kind of rock walls and and uh these these meadows and mountains i'm i'm definitely thinking scotland here i guess let's just guess scotland let's follow follow our gut instinct okay wasn't scotland it was whales well okay fair enough fair enough i was kind of getting like those those straight line mission vibes there so fair enough yeah makes sense ah we can almost see that sign but not really the trees definitely feel european i'm i'm even thinking they kind of look maybe baltic but the sign doesn't really feel baltic to me so i won't be going baltics here not getting any particular vibes in the past when i've gotten baltic vibes it sometimes turns out to be something like serbia romania so i'm gonna guess somewhere there i don't know let's see okay oh ukraine fair enough what wasn't too far so oh how i love skewed world right such such beautiful rounds the sun is to our south i think a little bit so would this be europe again or not quite hilly i don't think this is u.s or north america i don't think this is asia either so it has to be europe then right this is definitely not africa maybe something like czechia czechia can be hilly um well a lot of european countries can be hilly but for some reason czechia came to my mind let's see if that's right or not oh my god it wasn't i guess the sun wasn't to our south the sun is a little bit to the south damn you son son screwed me over here well you can't always trust the sun but i decided to trust it and got screwed over this time to be fair i wouldn't have gone bolivia if i knew we were in the southern hemisphere i would have gone maybe something like brazil argentina somewhere there let's see eleven thousand points eleven and a half thousand well worse than the first game but but but i'm still happy whenever i get more than ten thousand points i'm happy in this map i mean okay we are on an intersection wait we have the flag here that's puerto rico right right we have this rectangular sign which you see in america's oh what's that text there i can't really read what that says but i mean we have the puerto rico flag here it is puerto rico right i always mix up puerto rico and um cuba well this wouldn't be cuba right i could see this being puerto rico maybe um so let's go let's go somewhere here i just double checked it is a puerto rico flag why is there a puerto rico flag in ecuador i don't know what are these rounds that we're getting that was such a baity round oh here oh oh what would this be would this be something like jordan or would this be maybe turkey the sun is to the south so that fits maybe something like israel palestine somewhere there i'm definitely getting that area uh my main guess would be jordan maybe but yeah i wouldn't be surprised about any of those those other countries there let's go kind of there are some some hills here so maybe let's go here ish so this isn't too far from the other countries either okay it was it was palestine okay i was right about the area so i'm happy about that oh hello here i was getting some oh what is this my first thought was on dora my first thought was andorra um i wish i could see some plates to confirm or deny that these houses uh these houses behind my big head again they're kind of giving me endurance vibes those stone um houses i was considering luxembourg as well for a second but i think andorra is more likely let's go somewhere there okay it was it was just an door okay i just sometimes like to overthink things over complicate things sometimes you just gotta go with your gut um hello what is this the uh first thought was tunisia very white houses the sun a little bit maybe to the south hard to tell it looks like generation three i would definitely go to nesia here which city should we guess let's go [Music] let's go zeus let's go seuss why not i could i did consider going fox but okay that would have been a good guess if i went there oh no oh this looks tricky and this looks very tricky the sun i can't tell where the sun is the whole sky is very bright it looks like we might have a generation two camera it's hard to tell but it looks like we maybe have a circular blur up here really hard to tell with this sky here maybe not maybe not i'm getting either maybe some us vibes maybe south american vibes and i want to go us gonna go to south dakota i don't know nebraska let's go nebraska i don't know i was south america it was peru i didn't recognize the poll maybe the poll could have helped there fifteen thousand points though so i'm happy about that let's do one more game these games are faster so let's do the fourth one let's do the fourth one okay we have um sun to the south of course i was getting an ireland vibes because the greens that we get are very very green and you get that in ireland and estonia as well fun fact but this just feels very irish to me so i would go there and i i feel the road will also would fit with ireland and the landscape in general let's go kind of here on northern ireland fair enough fair enough but not too far not a bad guess oh we have some birch trees we have some brushes that we see i'm thinking could this be baltics i could see this being baltics for sure maybe even latvia should i maybe i should go latvia because otherwise people always find it funny that i don't recognize latvia so i sometimes just get lucky enough to be wrong so i think i might do it this time because i could easily see this being latvia yeah let's let's go lightly i don't see anything else that uh that would give it or give anything away this of course could be something like russia finland i don't know well let's see it was russia fair enough next round next round we have we have some interesting uh curbs uh getting very american vibes the sun is to the south huh so i'm thinking either us or mexico we have dashed lines though what what's with the dashed lines here i'm confused now we do have some yellow i think on the road there which would confirm america's ah what's in the polls i don't recognize these poles i don't recognize these lines i'm so confused here i wanna i'm gonna go mexico but i might be very wrong on this one let's see it was mexico that was a very interesting mexico because with those dashed lines and the poles i couldn't tell are they uh octagonal or not okay sun is to the south we get some uh houses on wood like poles this tree this tree here ah stilted houses with a tree like this i'm confused if it wasn't for the tree i would have gone something like cambodia maybe some palm trees i think i might still go something like malaysia maybe this looks like generation 4 camera so malaysia i'm not sure about this tree though it feels weird to me but i don't really have a better guess in my mind so let's go somewhere there and thailand huh okay fair enough it was thailand cambodia would have been a much better guy song what does it say lamar that doesn't help the sun appears to be to the south i was thinking turkey maybe i don't know though feels a bit weird for turkey but what else could this be could this be something in africa um something like i don't know ghana i kind of like ghana or nigeria more than turkey on this one um i don't know though i don't know i'm feeling africa but i don't know where let's go let's let's go con now let's go gone it was nigeria no no oh i was so close i almost went nigerian switch ah that's unfortunate 17 000 points my best game today let's go again let me know in the comments how you did if you played along and on the right side there will be another play along video that i think you will enjoy huge thanks all the patreons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "images_path":

play a geographer map called wild animals if you enjoy these play along videos don't forget to press that like button and here we go here is the map wild animals all the play along links as always will be in the description as the maps title suggests this map contains animals in the wild so good luck everyone oh hello this monkey i think you get these monkeys in hong kong if i'm not mistaken we have some chinese text as well here please keep country parks clean i think i've seen those monkeys in hong kong before they might be elsewhere as well but with the chinese texts i would definitely choose to go hong kong on this one and i know hong kong is also hilly as we we have here quite quite high mountains and they also have a lot of lot of coverage in these parks so i think hong kong is a really good guess here well i don't know which which of many many parks this would be so i think we just have to guess there it doesn't say on the bins or anything right it might say but i can't really read that's that's unfortunate because because i think it might be saying that park's name there but they just can't really read it let's use this here this one kamshan country park kind of in the middle of it all so let's go there okay not bad actually really good guess well hong kong isn't too big either way so either way it would have been pretty good guess okay oh we have some oh are those ostriches or emus i never know the difference so would this be australia i think this might be it looks like we we might be driving on the left side here exit yes sign is on the left side now where in australia would this be i don't see any good clues looking at the landscape uh i kinda wanna go like victoria maybe i don't know just just going by the vibes but my australian vibes aren't aren't the best i usually rely on some polls or road signs or something in australia but we don't have any of those here so let's go victoria and it was victoria okay my vibes my vibes are on point today let's go okay we have some penguins adorable penguins are so cute you get penguins in the southern hemisphere so that's that's that's a good to know you will get penguins in southern hemisphere but where though we have some houses here on this island i know you can get penguins in the falkland islands the south sandwich islands but i don't think i've seen houses there so it might not be there now can we figure out which country this is don't see we don't see the language at all it's too too bright the sign the sun of course is to the north no surprises there i'm thinking could this be somewhere in new zealand i don't know if the houses would fit but i don't really know what architecture this would be i can't put my finger on it so to speak we have some palm trees as well could this be let's go we have we have some palm trees so it's so confusing i want to go some some new zealand tasmania islands but let's see it was south africa damn it it was south africa okay just knowing that it was southern hemisphere was not enough unfortunately okay cape town makes sense the architecture wasn't screaming africa to me but i guess i was wrong oh again these monkeys cute monkeys um would this be hong kong again or elsewhere because i always associate these monkeys in hong kong but maybe they're elsewhere too i guess we'll find out i could see this being hong kong again seems quite hilly possibly um kind of asian looking temple so why not hong kong again do we see any language maybe we don't see any language unfortunately this may be some monkey sanctuary or something because there are a lot of monkeys all over the place here would be really interesting to to visit this place gotta be careful though i've seen videos where these monkeys steal purses and stuff so so gotta keep your belongings close because the monkeys can get naughty let's go with hong kong i guess just because of the monkeys again if it wasn't for the monkeys i would definitely go asia but but you know i'm happy with hong kong though i'm happy with hong kong guess let's go there again this same park maybe indonesia bali island apparently malaysia crossed my mind but that would have been wrong too a bit closer though but still wrong monkeys betrayed me so apparently you can't get those monkeys elsewhere oh what is this car hello oh no i don't know this google car we have oh gosh are these copy bars or what's the name of i've seen this animal before very cute were they called copy bars or something else i'm not sure i notice a lot of palm trees here a lot of palm trees we have i'm with this google car i'm thinking could this google car be i'm not sure but there is this colombian island which one was it was it this one oh god which island was it one of these islands no it wasn't corn island was it no no that's too small it was one of these islands where it belongs to colombia i think and it did have some weird car i'm not sure if it was this one uh i might be in the wrong island i don't remember which one it was but let's see it was not those islands apparently i am wrong i don't think i even had seen this car before it was on the border of argentina and uruguay some some national park again so i guess you get copy borrowers in that area let's see we have almost 10 000 points which i had some good cases some not so good guesses but this is a difficult map this is the difficult map for sure in my opinion if you play along let me know in the comments how you are doing i always enjoy reading your comments oh gosh what is this now we have some huge i've never seen these birds in my life before wow these are some very interesting looking birds i hate these beach island locations so much wait i mean these little poles could this be galapagos because i i feel like i've seen like little poles like this on an island in galapagos before this feels kind of flat for galapagos although we do have some some mountains in the distance on the other island there is another when yeah i mean could it look very similar to mexican bollards that you see on the roadside they have the same colors black at the bottom white at the top but i feel yeah this i think this has to be galapagos we have another island to our south and the one that we are on is quite flat could we be here could we be here i don't have no idea if that island has coverage maybe we are here somewhere where was it oh we were here okay oh we were on a very small island okay but it was galapagos i'm very happy that i noticed those little little sticks in the ground they they saved me there for sure oh we have australia with some very very again interesting looking bird i've i've no idea what these birds are i i don't really know much about uh fauna i always mix up flora and fauna but the fauna is animals flora is is uh plants i know it but i still mix it up from time to time um so this is australia we have we see an antenna the biggest clue about it being australia was this giveaway sign because uh it shows we're driving the left side first of all and second of all in new zealand the giveaway text would be red in australia it is black as you see the question is where we see some water to our west southwest the poles oh i wish i knew my australian poles better 20 seconds remaining [Music] oh no i already feel zigzag disappointed in me uh let's go adelaide there are some hills there and this feels a bit hilly and we have some water to our south this look at the west sydney why did we have water south oh my gosh oh my of course of course it was just a bay it was australia it was australia but you know wrong city did we see some yellow plates i didn't notice i don't think we did have any yellow plates there okay we we get the big car meta here without the car meta we could see that we are driving the left side so i think we could get kenya even without that uh big google car that we see a very very red soil which is also quite common in that area kenya uruguay they often get some very red soil the animals of course the animals themselves some sort of i don't know those are not deer but what are they i don't know what those are let me know in the comments again if you know because because i don't recognize those these tropical animals we have some hills we have a dark soil so i would go maybe somewhere here ish is this a national partner that's a forest i'm assuming we might be in a national park let's go somewhere here rumah national park might be more north we'll see it was more north there was this national park mount elgon national park but it was western kenya just just wrong national park unfortunately but i'm still happy with my guess oh god wait is this that tiny tiny island we have a bird not really a seagull i thought it was seagull at first but no the beak looks different for some reason i think this this one island that that i had in one of my videos with zigzag can i find it now where was it it was somewhere here the triangle island oh no oh here is triangle island it's such a tiny tiny triangle with no no texts no nothing it's just a triangle in the middle of pacific ocean but it has coverage and it looks like this the coverage is on the very very coast and the jungle starts right there so um i think it might be there just because the coverage looks so similar so i think i'll go there let's see chai said no oh no it was a different tiny island in the middle of an ocean oh no this is how that triangle island looks like it does look a bit different doesn't it but still the same kind of same feeling let's keep going then what do we have next we have a lot of birds so i'm thinking midway at all also with like an airfield because you get some airfields in midway at all i'm i'm happy with with going midway at all here so it's quite quite close to the triangle island that we just saw except it's a bit larger and easier to find the the the runway goes i think it's this runway looking at the angle we are on the road next to the runway is that the second runway that we see i think that's the second runway that we see there to our north so i think we might be somewhere here ish i think let's go perfect score hey oh i'm so happy about that after that previous round okay 16 793 points i'm very happy with that score and let's try the third game again link in the description of course we have official coverage we have some animals there are those i'm not sure those are not cows but i'm not sure what they are hard really hard to see we have cacti which i notice and the sun is to our north so where are we oh gosh i was thinking mexico at first but the sun is to the north so that doesn't really fit what else would it could this ever be kind of weird in northern colombia because it can look quite dry but i think it doesn't i think it looks a bit different argentina let's go argentina actually i like argentina um but where i never i never know where to guess in argentina i'm quite certain this would be argentina with these small bushes let's go more south maybe uh oh no it was north i never know where to guess in argentina god dammit i figured out it was argentina eventually but i guessed completely the wrong area because northern argentina can't look dry southern argentina can look dried oh it's a mess it's a mess okay round number two at least i got the country i'm happy about that that that's always gonna look for that silver lining even if you make a bad guess we we are on some oh these huge stairs oh wait i've seen these i know there are like huge stairs in malaysia we had them in the geo detective which side are we driving on can we tell i think yeah we're driving on the left side here okay okay yeah yeah i remember this big guy that's 100 malaysia i'll try to find the video and leave it in the info card for those of you don't know geodetective is where i try to find the viewer locations from the pictures they send in so go and check out those videos if that sounds interesting i do not remember where in malaysia that temple was there was a very beautiful beautiful large stairs with this statue in front okay it was nearby kuala lumpur batu caves apparently okay so i wasn't too far away geo detective helped me there let's go let's go next round we have some language which is malaysian indonesian i think we have rp we have a white car welcome to pankhur pankhur we have some monkeys we have some cute monkeys these kind of houses um i feel like we're common oh i might be mistaken i think they were coming in solo i see but i might be wrong though what was the name pankour can we maybe find pankoor the chance is low but we can try oh i don't see pond quarters in solo ac so that's not good ten seconds oh no panko where is punk war it was just java island the very very corner of it these are some difficult oh this is even more difficult what is this now oh we have some bears that's adorable bear in the little cob cub i think is the name oh even more bears oh this is cute but bears are bears are cute but dangerous looks like we are in some national park again with some big snowy mountains the sun is to the south my first thought was canada and i think the mountains would fit with something like british columbia i'm not sure about the plants but i'm assuming it might be there so okay i guess let's go some national park again provincial park let's go up provincial park no well it was not canada it was russia kamchatka strikes again huh well okay right next to the kuril lake that's a rough guess that's a rough guess ouch we have some swans we have some are those ducks i think um some sort of a bridge pedestrian bridge the houses kind of feel nordic but the bridge is kind of weird-ish i'm thinking something like finland or maybe sweden i feel like it feels very nordic you know in terms of the trees the general landscape the animals i think i'm more inclined to go finland but i wouldn't be surprised about it being sweden as well we have a lot of water here so let's go in a place where there is a lot of water around us which is most of finland let's go somewhere there in the middle-ish okay it was when oh it was surprisingly close to helsinki wow i wasn't thinking there wow okay fair enough downtown helsinki let's view the summary 14 000. all in all i think i did pretty good let me know how you did and on the right side there will be another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/iyIEuilHfUYp1CjB", "data/images_geopeter/KR5LWfmpryFvWthA",

another video and in this one you are gonna see me struggle because we are gonna play usa versus canada map as you probably already know north america is definitely not one of my strengths so i thought let's try this map maybe do some practicing maybe i'll learn something new maybe you learn something new i will add the play along links in the description if you want to practice as well but this this video is more kind of kind of like yeah like for practicing not for competing with each other at least in my my mind so let's have a look what do we have around if i remember correctly in canada that these one-way sands do not say one way so there would be blank arrows in canada so looking at the sun i would think that this should be the us another thing is that a green road signs i i know you can get them in canada but uh from what i've seen they are a bit more common in the us so take that with a pinch of salt of course we have a flag here so us i don't know the other flag but i'm thinking that's one of the state flags that all look the same dark blue with something in the middle we do not have a front plate in the u.s most of the southern states don't have front plates and then there is this um kind of kind of strip of states going north that also don't have it i'll add the image in the edit so so you know what i mean looks quite wintry it doesn't feel very southern to me so i would guess maybe pennsylvania maybe let's go somewhere there okay never mind it was more southern it was alabama sweet home alabama fair enough next round i know that you can get these wide double yellow lines in some states in the us but i don't remember which ones uh mid does it say mid america something america i noticed that we have wm on this trash bin and i don't know if this is state specific spoiler alert for the previous video if you haven't watched it i thought the wm would be for for wisconsin or michigan it turned out to be tennessee so i don't know maybe this wm is tennessee specific so i think i'm gonna go tennessee because of the wm if anyone in the comments knows about these kind of wider yellow lines in the middle do let me know and about any other tips that i might be missing because i do want to improve my um north america skills it was not tennessee specific apparently it was iowa so we have uh something neon circle parking structure now would this be u.s or canada the plates look i don't know i know that license plates is something that can be very helpful and useful but there are so many of them and each state has like some vanity plates and it's insane how many plates there are in the us i would probably go us here again although the fauna doesn't really feel canadian to me i was thinking maybe do we have we do have front plates i was thinking maybe california because i know california can be very diverse in terms of nature and i could see this maybe being somewhere in california so i don't know if the plates match or not but let's maybe go go go california it was california let's go let's go i am happy about this round next stop are we gonna get some canadian runs i feel this might be u.s again we have a yellow plate here which looks in terms of color quite similar to the new york we have some white plates as well so this might be not in new york this might be in a neighboring state maybe another kind of obscure and definitely not guaranteed clue but but if you can't decide which country to go maybe it helps from what i've heard in the us it is more common to have windows kind of divided into two like this you can see more windows kind of divided into two in canada you can sometimes see it but supposedly in canada it is more common to see just just one big window instead of windows divided in half that's what i've heard and after some small testing it seemed to be right so yeah that's that's that's something that i sometimes use as well looking at those windows and the plate as well i would say us somewhere near new york state maybe something like massachusetts it was still the new york state yeah okay so we were in new york we had two white plates so i thought maybe not but okay oh this is an interesting one this is like hawaii because this definitely doesn't feel like your typical um us or canada it looks like we have this big yellow reflector on that pole which is a thing in hawaii we see a big yellow reflector here on this pole as well in conjunction with the flora and the nature around us i would go hawaii here those poles and then the landscapes it was hawaii just just a different island but but the point still stands so let's keep going again the link in the description if you want to practice yourself i like to put these play along links in the description because not everyone has the pro account and you can play along even if you don't have the pro account i have a whole playlist with these play long videos so if you even if you don't have the the pro version there are so many links in my videos that you can keep playing for weeks but where would this be no parking with this border these signs can be helpful this border around the sign was it american i might be wrong but i think that sign oh how do i always miss flags i don't know i genuinely don't know how do i like i just somehow ignore flags because i was looking at this before and i just didn't register that that's a flag i was looking for more clues like some obscure signs and stuff but okay this is america again these divided windows as you can see i hope we get a canadian location as well because thus far it's all been america so we can see some canadian windows as well to compare but i genuinely don't know where in the us this would be do we have front plates i don't see if we have front plates i want to go something like i don't know north carolina somewhere there it was illinois um at least i got the country we did have a flag though but still we have these bollards these type of kind of roads with these black stripes um i feel are way more common in the us we have front plate the windows i can't tell if they are divided i think they might be divided in the middle again it's difficult to tell but i feel like these bollards are again more common in the us as well because in canada the bollards are different and kind of more standardized than when it comes to provinces each province has their own bollard so i would go us again this feels quite southern but we do have a front plate so maybe kind of northern texas so we're gonna here ish i don't know okay it was texas but not that northern okay but at least i got the country and the state oh we have canada these are canadian signs with maximum on them maximum is if you see maximum it is canada in the us it would say speed limit we do have a divided window here in canada too so it's again definitely not a guaranteed tip but i feel like every little bit helps when you have absolutely no idea then even the smallest clues can help we have cambridge blackrock waterville and blackrock road i don't know where any of those places are a little bit hilly i kind of want to go something like um new bronze we do we have front plates i don't see if we have front plates let's go new bronze weeks let's see okay not bad it was nova scotia nearby here we have dollar tree fedex this feels very american to me it feels too dry for canada if it makes sense it feels something like nevada arizona somewhere this area oh and again we have this one way sign in canada there would be no text it wouldn't say one way we have palm trees also not the thing you usually see in canada and we do have front plates we do have front plates from what i notice so it's not gonna be arizona or new mexico it still could be nevada i think i think nevada uses front plates now we have us flag maybe texas i don't know let's go texas maybe but i could easily see it being something like nevada it was texas oh san antonio marathon this feels quite cold do we see houses with windows the windows are divided here so is it gonna be us or is it gonna be canada again [Music] can we can we trust the divided window metta this sign would feel more u.s as well with that red border but don't don't quote me on that i don't know if that's an actual thing oh yeah this triangle these triangle signs are unique to the us you don't see them in canada this time the divided window meta works do we have front plates i don't think we do it's hard to see in the distance but i don't think we do so let's go feeling this northern with no front plates maybe something like michigan indiana let's see okay not as northern kentucky wasn't as northern as i thought even though the score isn't the greatest i think i did break okay let's go for another one let's go for another one now this feels quite southern broken wash by broken washers but are they buying broken washers or they want me to buy broken washers that's a confusing sign we have these kind of kind of southern looking plants we have a doggo adorable we have front plates the windows the windows are divided i don't know where which state to be honest i i want to go something like missouri maybe let's see again texas we're getting so much texas today interesting we have these rumble strips these rumble strips they are more common in the u.s double yellow lines with a gap in the middle again where did we have gap before which state was it miniature golf i haven't played miniature golf for a long time actually kinda wanna do that well i'm quite certain this should be the us we have front plate so let's go should we go missouri again let's go missouri again why not it was iowa getting really a lot of us runs but i think this is canada one prawn front plate why not these windows are not divided like horizontally as you can see these windows also don't appear to be divided no front plate november again not divided windows in canada to remember which provinces have front plates you can remember the numbers one four five seven which corresponds to one being british colombia manitoba ontario and new brunswick those are the provinces that two use front and rear plates one four five seven since we do not have front plates um it's not going to be any of those i'm feeling kind of maybe eastern vibes something like like nova scotia again let's go that's good guys that's good guys okay this feels way more southern i don't think this is going to be canada but where would it be we have these kind of wooden signposts i don't know if that helps these kind of reflectors also i don't think are canadian but i feel the biggest biggest clue here is the landscape just just doesn't look like canada at all i would go something like uh i don't know arizona nevada somewhere near grand canyon maybe let's go there it was oh it was california okay fair enough kind of that area but the wrong state again rumble strips first thing that i notice here we do have front plates you haul you you get u-haul in both countries so that doesn't really help no idea here let's go ohio it was virginia let's do some more practicing but i feel like i feel like i'm getting better at recognizing the countries at least when it comes to where in the country not so much so we have one and a half mile written on this sign so if you have miles then it's going to be the u.s of course the windows again divided horizontally divided we have front plates here more divided windows i'm telling you there's something to the divided windows that's that's a good meta i'm assuming that this sign is probably state specific but i just don't know which state sign designs can can often help with the state because many states do have unique designs for their signs their their highway shields are different and stuff like that but let's just i just don't know that those differences we do have front plates so let's go i don't know maybe ohio again or maybe even more northeast it was southeast virginia virginia what do we have here hello we have divided windows um these windows are divided as well most of them [Music] speed limit yep it is us divided windows this feels like northeast to me something like uh i don't know massachusetts or maybe it's a bit more south something like virginia again let's see it was oh this one this time it was ohio the one time i don't go ohio it turns out to be ohio okay i see how it is we have some palm trees here so it should be us these windows are not really horizontally divided but even without the horizontally divided windows we have a flag uh this this is u.s for sure front plate we do have with palm trees i don't know texas again the california makes sense as well we couldn't really see it from the place we were at but i just wanted you to to let you know that if you ever see poles in the u.s or generally with these three yellow reflectors like this it would indicate that you are in california more palm trees next more palm trees clay county i know you can see these signs in the u.s i don't know if they are in particular states surveillance a deed restricted community with no front plates i would go maybe something like alabama mississippi okay we are in florida apparently fair enough oh this is a bit more tricky i feel we do not have front plates here this sign again seems like the very similar to that sign we had in the previous round just from the other side would this be florida again this doesn't feel like florida to me but because of this particular sign i would go with us here no idea where let's go georgia this time it was mississippi all in all i think i did pretty good we got a lot of u.s rounds not so many canadian ones but i hope you learned some tips maybe from me and if you have any tips for me let me know in the comments on the right side there will be another play along video just for you and huge thanks all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this

are gonna play a map containing every single country in the world i'm pretty sure we've played this map before but i wanna play it again cause i always love how you never know what to expect with this map because it can have countries from everywhere in the world as always if you want to play along the links will be in the description make sure to play them before watching this video and you can play along also with a free account in case you didn't know just just log in and then follow the link what do we have we have a hyundai oil bank we have some korean language so okay oh and this is official coverage do we have any phone numbers phone numbers can be helpful in korean zero five in in south korea if i remember correctly kind of seoul area was zero two and then it goes kind of to the to lower i think zero five was kind of dagu maybe or jeonju dong c university is there a place called dongxi don't see university i'm sorry if i'm mispronouncing the names very unlikely for me to find it but i'm thinking because of the phone number i'm thinking daegu maybe jionju okay it was buzan okay it was a bit more south than i thought but okay not too bad though daegu and then busan not too far apart so i'm happy with this start next we have some palm trees unofficial coverage so could be absolutely anywhere in the world the author's name is osama taha obide is the author of this photosphere we have some green houses for growing some plants palm trees i don't think this is tunisia but i'm getting kind of similar vibes to tunisia so i think it might be kind of nearby maybe libya maybe algeria maybe something like lebanon or syria even i'm thinking this this feels kind of mediterranean to me but i might be very wrong since this is unofficial then i don't know too much about the polls or or other other clues we might have so i'm gonna go with algeria ah it was a rock oh well it was almost mediterranean not the greatest round uh made a blunder there made a big blunder but okay another official coverage i feel like official coverages is my strength in these maps because usually i play official locations so so i know more about them for example we have these uh electricity counters in central america and mexico and guatemala this should be mexico because we get these kind of octagonal poles here in the distance and also sun is to the south and if you play with meta then uh this google car you get in a couple of countries mexico is one of them if you want to learn more tips about latin america i will leave the info card in the top right corner where you can go and check out latin america tips we have a palm tree we have some green mountains i wanna go maybe somewhere cordoba somewhere this area maybe oh more north more north ah we'll get the country right but still not not very happy with that guess there the language here appears to be maybe uh ukrainian maybe bella russian because when you see cyrillic with this eye letter that happens in ukrainian and that happens in belarus oh it says belaruski here belaruski so i'm guessing it is belarussian huh well where in belarus would we be huh well it really helps if you know cyrillic in these locations because if you can read it belarusky belarus is belarus as you might have suspected doesn't this doesn't seem like a big city at all i don't think this is minsk let's maybe go somewhere you know this area i don't know just just pure gas and of course it is the other way than i suspected of course very border location makes sense because it didn't feel hilly i don't know which parts of belarus are hilly but i know this part of lithuania is hilly so it makes sense that there would be hilly here in belarus as well yeah i i should have guessed western now that i think more about it but okay never mind what we have here we have white lines all white lines these kind of kind of poles with this top we've seen them a lot in france but i think i've seen them in spain as well so i'm thinking spain here this is official coverage again the plates are a bit too far to see the sun is to the south so that would work this just feels so spanish to me it's ever be something else you're too far from the guardrails to see them properly really too far from everything that i wanna see can't see the plates can't see the guardrails but just just looking at the landscape i would go with spain here and um let's go and hear this area maybe a bit more west but it was spain very central spain so i'm happy that i recognized that 17 200 points some better guesses some worse ones the second round could have been better but again it was quite difficult i would say if you are playing along let me know in the comments how you are doing if you manage to beat me or not let me know i'm always interested to read your your comments and then respond to them of course okay here we are basically right in the middle of a forest the author's name is sergey m with cyrillic letters judging by the trees most of them are very kind of frail looking very thin which is common in very north very northern places oftentimes in norway for example you in the northern norway you see these very very fray looking trees we have some birch trees as well not too many but there are some there are some birch trees so i want to go northern russia here because of the the set author being sergey and uh these these kind of very thin looking trees there are some bigger ones as well so i don't think we are like too far north but but but maybe something like i don't know here this is just a random forest it literally could be anywhere so i i want to go you know somewhere somewhere in the middle of russian forest somewhere here it was that close to moscow seriously wow i was not expecting it to be that close to moscow it was just wow it felt more northern and it definitely didn't feel that close to a huge city like moscow some well this this this photosphere's author is computer technology which doesn't help oh this kind of outfit interesting where do they have outfits like this my first thought was kind of a monk you see in movies but it's not really the same i don't think very deserty this is a fascinating one we have these kind of um i don't know how to call them buckets probably there's a mine in the distance and and wow this oh really interesting really really interesting where would this be i'm thinking maybe pakistan but the pants in pakistan you see baggy pants quite a lot we have very tight pants here i'm thinking maybe india because of that cause because of the pants not being baggy enough it was india not the area that i thought this area at least from this map appears to be quite dry so that's why i went there but but okay i might be there i guess the right great country there this is official coverage oh what what is this oh okay metta i know not everyone likes meta i am sorry without the meta well without the meta i would be screwed i'll be honest this definitely looks like an island so yeah that's where meta comes in since this is official coverage we can use this car to our advantage if you know where it is that is you get this this type of car with this visible back in american samoa in american samoa i believe this island the other islands had some different cars but i think it was on this island the road goes kind of in that direction and turns to the northwest and then there is water to our west or to our east or to our east there's water to our east could be somewhere here i don't know let's keep it kind of in the middle oh wow okay it was a very very eastern okay could have been a bit closer but i'm happy with the guests since i recognized the car here another official we're getting a lot of official coverages in this in this seed we have a lot of these yellow holes i think we have a yellow license plate in the distance and also before even looking around with these kind of red and white curbs i feel like it's quite common in kind of israel and that area and and and i think we do have yellow yeah we do have yellow plates on this bus as well can we spot some hebrew around us just to just to verify i don't see any language at all these might be some hebrew letters here but i'm not sure very dry looking and he although there are some palm trees could it be somewhere here could we be super far south elliot should we risk it for the let's risk it for the biscuit it is quite hilly here as you can see i think there is official coverage i think it could there might be some palm trees let's risk it for the biscuit i didn't get the biscuit oh gosh it was israel just just absolutely not where i guessed just a different city ah i'm so far away so far away this is an interesting sign here this is this is an unofficial one this is a photo sphere could be anywhere again we have some german laban i know laban is like life eingang so this is this is we have a lot of german language so i'm thinking this is probably germany author's name is theo sparrow the houses the architecture feels kind of similar to the netherlands and belgium also these types of roads you see a lot of in in the netherlands so i'm thinking i'm thinking maybe we are in germany near kind of towards the netherlands munster or somewhere in this area because of the architecture and the paved roads so let's go let's go kind of western germany very western let's go let's go my my thinking was right it was very western germany close to the netherlands in total 19 000 points i think that might be my best score in this map this map has some tricky locations the first round was the was the furthest one for me in this case was it was a tricky one but let me know how you did if you played along let's have a look dead end dead end so we're in the northern america emergency and outpatient what's outpatient what does it mean outpatient entrance emergency is this some sort of a hospital i think this would be canada this is a tobacco-free campus we do have front plates here is that no that's not a flag that's the the windsock clinic some sort of a clinic in canada i think it was one four five seven the provinces that have front plates we do have front plates here looking like this i think it has to be oh okay okay it wasn't even uh canada it was the us but it was close to close to canada and close to british columbia so i kind of get lucky there to be honest because i guess against british columbia because it has front plates um okay next round next round for north america i'm very happy with that guess very beautiful temples whenever i see these golden temples my first thought is myanmar because these these golden temples are very very common there very very common we have some flags but i can't really tell if those are country flags or some other flags some some monks i think some some children monks we have black license plates which i think we've had black license plates in the past in myanmar i think a couple of videos ago we had some black license plates and i didn't know it at the time that they they have some black license plates in myanmar what's the author's name oh the author's name yeah i think this script also would fit with the one they use in myanmar yaya the language is the same so this is 100 myanmar but where it looks quite hilly he looks kind mountainous but then again i think most of myanmar is very mountainous so let's go maybe kind of this area kind of for hedging purposes but i i definitely know that this is a very mountainous area so let's go there let's go that's a really good guess 43 kilometers away i'm super happy about that guys can't really see the text here it's very faded so can't read it the author's name is mario silva which i don't think helps too much might be spanish but then again people travel this is a very tricky round very tricky it looks so weird that these wires and this is the electricity boxes on the tree where do these wires go do these small wires go through the ground looks unsafe but okay if i had to guess which i i do have to guess i would go nicaragua maybe kind of central america somewhere maybe somewhere somewhere in america's i don't know let's get nicaragua and hope oh gosh it was africa angola well that was a very challenging round i would say yeah youth life this is official coverage again huge life volkswagen some license plates with no front plates well this is somewhere again in north america with no front plates huh no front plates is this canada or u.s school bus village west leasing enjoy the nations railroad crossing was this railroad crossing sign american or no or my maybe misremembering things is that a wm wm on the trash bin could that w stand for a wisconsin wisconsin something i don't know or maybe the m stands for michigan did wisconsin have front plates or not i don't remember i know michigan doesn't have front plates gosh i don't know if they are that hilly though it looks like wisconsin might be a bit hilly here or i feel like it's one of the two maybe wisconsin tennessee why was there wm on a trash bin in tennessee there is neither w nor m in tennessee neither in nashville i knew i shouldn't trust the wm but it didn't really feel like tennessee to me to be honest so we have these whenever i see these palm trees my first thought is on cambodia or thailand in that area you can see these palm trees in some other countries but i feel like those are the most common there sri lanka as well indonesia sometimes let's have a look around we have a white car you can get a white car in cambodia so that might check out we have these these uh leafy palms big palm trees there isn't too much to see just a lot of these these palm trees i feel like these poles i've seen them before were they indonesian by any chance i feel like i've seen these poles i i don't remember my memory my memory darn it i'm gonna go cambodia i'm scared they might have been indonesian poles but let's see they were indonesian poles they were indonesian poles that's what i get for not trusting the poles ah well at least now i know that i remembered the polls correctly so that's the silver lining in this round twelve thousand points uh this was a rough game i hope you did better than me in these games and on the right side there will be another video with play along games in any country in the world huge thanks to all of the patreons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ",

to predict what score i will get in them on each map i have two power ups where i can ask either if i'm thinking of the right country or the right continent and at the end of all three maps we see how close zigzag's predictions were don't forget to press that like button and after watching this video go and check out zigzag's channel where he plays the maps that i made for him okay let's begin with the first game what do we have oh okay first thought we have these these kind of baggy pants which would make me think pakistan possibly oh wow this is going to wobble a wobbly coverage i didn't realize that that's so interesting okay we have king something medical university looking at the clothes and the coverage in general since this is official coverage i would say oh yeah we see some what appears to be urdu here so yeah my guess would be pakistan pakistan doesn't have too much coverage this is true so i am thinking something like uh maybe islamabad i think lahore had some coverage i mean i can maybe kind of kind of scan over maybe a notice king something university if it's big enough islamabad's a very organized city it is yeah it's also surprisingly green a lot very very good irrigation system there so so it's very very green a lot of parks lahore maybe i'm not sure which other cities have coverage in pakistan but i know that these two have some for sure i think lahore seems to have more different universities so maybe i'll um more inclined to go there then i think this will be my guess let's have a look okay nice let's go well done well done very good start oh indeed yeah king edward medical university but it isn't even marked as university in the map which is interesting it's the same color but it's yes okay mayo hospital that's that's an interesting name but okay oh okay so we have what appears to be north america we have church road and queen street queen street immediately immediately would make me think canada maybe because it's part of the commonwealth so a queen street would make sense maybe oh yeah oh yeah oh there is a flag in the distance which could be canadian hard to see but but i could see that being canadian vlog i see some red and white there definitely some red and white that's for sure um westgate apartments i notice that we don't have front plates and it's something that i always forget which canadian provinces had on hand in front plates i've studied it multiple times in the past but i always forget which is unfortunate square feet wait they use square feet in canada as well right i know they use kilometers per hour for for like speed i think i think even in australia we sometimes talk about apartments in square feet just because that's what's traditionally done you know even though we don't use feet for most things interesting yeah i never never thought about it before it's looking relatively flat from what i can see um so so maybe something like i'm not sure i want to go ontario and then hope for the best hopefully they didn't have front plates oh gosh it was alberta no unlucky oh no ontario sadly is one of the ones that uses front plates oh no i'm watching it unfortunately i should study my front plates for in canada uh on a country's biggest canada it's worth knowing it oh yeah yeah 100 okay we have some english what appears to be quite quite american again speed hump ahead what does it say hyde park oh some sort of a park i can't can't really read what park i don't think in london then hold on has to be hyde park yeah we have an interesting water hydrant here which i don't know if that means anything blue with yellow i'd probably be more inclined to go us here but do we have front plates can we see it looks like some have front plates some don't which is very helpful you're welcome well maybe it is helpful maybe it is helpful you never know maybe maybe yeah you've picked some some tricky locations for me i wonder how how well you predict predict my scores in these tricky locations it's going to be interesting i think well i'm not going to say anything until the seed's over but you're going to be interested to see what i predicted since at least one car has no front plates i would maybe go our arkansas i don't know do the trees the trees feel maybe a bit north more northern than arkansas maybe something like cedar rapids i don't know let's see ah okay where was it north carolina huh so yeah right now right on the border with front plate using virginia tricky tricky no i didn't have to think about that when i was picking locations i guess i guess it was actually kind of a clue or kind of a bait little yeah a little i can't assume this might be near like a state that uses front plates but okay so we have a long long antenna here with a big white plate would this be iceland that was that is we have some european plates here though but most of the most of the plates don't have the blue strip crit chris fish wait what i love how you said that chris fisher chris fish this is an interesting one because quite a lot of trees for iceland i think the steering wheel is in on the under on the left side with water to the north i think i'll have to use a power up here because because iceland still have two in reserve because iceland is so far away from everything and this doesn't really feel like your typical iceland so i guess i'll use my my country power up is this iceland it is not ice it is not iceland okay what else is it with plates like these then hmm i feel like i should know this how are you feeling architecture wise of all those buildings that are over to you west there it feels kind of western europe i would say in terms of architecture most of the plates not having the blue strip is really throwing me off here i don't know i i gotta guess something could this be something like belgium i could see this these houses maybe being in belgium i don't like this guess but but i just don't don't have a better one it's definitely not there for northern france maybe somewhere here this town okay let's let's see how wrong am i oh denmark okay that was definitely a tough round well benjamin denmark to me at least looks quite similar in terms of architecture yeah yeah architecturally they're very similar that's true yeah definitely just a tough one now at the plates because i've never seen that in belgium before those are some really tricky ones i was like looking for like kind of like because i was trying to make this one bit the easier one but then i found that location i was like well i'm going to put it in anyway i was like i knew it kind of looked like iceland with the car and with the oh it really did yeah i really did but the too many trees for iceland it was less trees that probably would have gone iceland but okay let's go for the fifth round here okay so we have yellow outer lines these these triple middle lines and then appears driving left my first instinct would be south africa and it also looks like we have generation iv car which which wouldn't be like eswatini or lesotho or botswana the sun is to the north so that fits no no way you have found some some weird australia with yellow outer lines so this small small chevron also should be uh south african as well what is that white sign those these signs are weird though yeah i'm not the best with with like south african landscapes this looks very very dry even drier than lesotho like the mountains yeah these are definitely drier than lsuji mountains that's for sure oh where do they have mountains like that huh well well well well well do they have mountains near namibia up here it's quite green i don't think it will be would be there these mountains maybe somewhere here natural reserve i don't know you don't really get the kind of this area of south africa quite often so so i could see maybe you'd be picking here to kind of be trying to be more tricky well the psychological games yeah yeah exactly exactly and also quite risky to guess that far west because you can lose a lot of points and it looks like it is somewhat hilly in this area and i think i've seen some generation four there as well so let's have a look okay oh let's go i'm happy with this oh very close to the border on the right right wow so close that's what those signs were actually probably border crossings oh maybe yeah or something oh that would explain it yeah because you usually don't see signs like that in south africa so so that would explain like a border so how did i do in total 15 800 in total which or for a map like this i'm i'm i'm okay with that so what okay let me pull up my prediction it was i actually if i was really trying to game the system i shouldn't have picked canada because canada is like the type of country where you just like either get a lot of points so get very few points true so i i had banked on that you would get closer on the canada and i put you at twenty thousand six hundred and eighty three so you would you were within five thousand points of it so you know say you had a nailed to canada it would have been pretty close but yeah yeah the canada that was quite far let's do well played we'll play it especially in the south africa and uh very nice guesses okay so this one's made to be a bit harder this one's this one's harder level oh no i thought the first one was already tricky in some rounds this one's made to be harder okay so here we have at least lower points okay fair enough yeah so we have sun to the south the first on the first glance i was thinking north america looking quite american and looking around my suspicions seem to be confirmed gonna halloween decorations they really love their halloween in in north america oh yes they do ravens is halloween celebrating in australia as well as us fiercely it really came in in like the last 15 years i would say and still still it's not that popular but yeah yeah okay he's probably similar in europe to be honest yeah it has some traction but it isn't nearly nearly as popular as it's in the u.s oh the architecture was really interesting on this round it's like boxy houses it is yeah it is and i think i noticed a um where was it well we were talking a canadian flag here in the distance michi kamau michi kamau sounds like like maybe some some native native language maybe but yeah that doesn't really help me much i suppose you could probably find that thing all over that type of thing all over canada i assume probably uh again we we don't have front blades [Laughter] which tells you what peter it's not ontario okay it's not ontario okay good um this time with with kind of weird architecture i was thinking a little bit hilly i was thinking maybe kind of eastern canada could it be like newfoundland maybe not very happy with that guess maybe something like like or here and more north you don't really get coverage there do you i could see you picking like cape breton islands like the very edge of it or something like that i don't know let's guess here because i'm thinking maybe it's in this area so let's see it then okay not too bad oh i wasn't thinking up there because i don't ever see coverage from from from that providence it's new oh it's a new coverage interesting i think i don't i don't think um labrador really had any before and they got this road covered in gen 4 so oh interesting yeah i was not aware of that churchill falls well at least i wasn't too far three thousand points that's for canada that's pretty good especially for coverage i didn't know existed okay what do we have next oh oh no okay this looks tricky no no car meta for me to use how's that okay but it does look like we have a brazilian sign the sun is to the north oh brazil again is such a big country i can already tell that i wasn't as mean with the locations i gave i have in my maps but but it that doesn't necessarily matter because it's all relative it's all about you know how close you get that's true that's true i still have to perform well that's true we have uh these kind of barns i feel this would be like a again a weird coverage in a place you don't usually get i'm thinking kind of kind of somewhere like western north northern or western uh brazil maybe something like rondonia it's quite hilly there i think i've seen some red soil in that area as well i i want to guess here on dhonia risk it maybe a little bit i was damn yeah around the border you get in the right country but not particularly close which is which is kind of what i intended even though i chose i wasn't that too close i'm still like relatively happy that i couldn't i was considering this this area let's move on what do we have we have a black car first thing that i notice here and not many trees which should make me think kind of maybe southern um argentina or something these are quite typical argentinian poles i would say ramirez some spanish what i assume to be i think i'm happy with this being argentina because southern argentina looks like this in my mind i sometimes got too southern in argentina can't really don't estimate how south to go very well i think everyone struggles with that right we don't see any water do we is that water in the distance or are those mountains i can't tell this fog it looks like there might be mountains sometimes it's so hard to tell that kind of thing yeah this fog isn't helping at all i want to get somewhere somewhere here just gotta pick a random city and hope for the best that here um okay let's go estancia la lucia i don't know how no that's that's there's no there's nothing there okay there's maybe nothing okay tres lagos let's go there there at least some roads there listen okay let's see okay not too bad okay so maybe it was water that we saw possibly yeah i don't think it was any like i think it was just the haze looking like mountains no probably yeah yeah okay but still kind of right area again so i'm happy about that yeah that was a very good guess that was very solid okay nice nice we have round four oh this first thought here was estonia with the road like this but let's look around you still got your country hint and your uh continent right right right and we have this oh you definitely chose this on purpose so that i can't see the flag oh yeah [Music] you see these small triangular flags in many northern countries and then estonia being one of them you don't really see them in latvia is it because they're more patriotic in estonia that you see them there no i don't think it's about patriotic it's this just type of style i think i think estonia just wants to be like like considered nordic country very much so so they do things that that other nordic countries do so other nordic countries use these small triangular flags so so they do it as well i'm assuming that's why we have yeah i mean i would say this is estonia that was my first thought and with this flag that would kind of confirm it looks very baltic we have these wooden poles with kind of flat top which you see in estonia and in latvia so we have a lake or maybe could this be a river maybe kind of to our north northeast theoretically it could be like one of these islands or maybe could could it be here maybe it's like this straight could it be here i feel like the street would be bigger than this though let's get somewhere here ish if it is one of those islands then then i won't be too far i feel like it might be somewhere in this area so let's see okay completely other side of estonia i took a risk putting a baltic on on on the uh this quote unquote harder map that was definitely pretty easy for you yeah i mean you knew the country here quite quite quickly here but still chose the completely wrong side okay and the last round here we have all white lines oh have you put an australian round in huh do we have we do have ballards some some broken bollards sad broken bollards oh gosh balls will feel quite australian these look like very interesting polls i feel like i've seen them before in one of your videos but i don't remember probably i don't remember which state it was can't really see that where both of them broken i don't know it's kind of strange isn't it yeah someone really didn't like those bullards here aren't they just like i guess there's a lot of like burnouts on the road as well maybe oh maybe maybe but do we either we have gaps in the lines i know that gaps would be south australia but no we don't have gaps i don't know i'm thinking maybe queensland i'm very much not sure about that unfortunate wait is that banana i have to go banana what the hell there's the town called legendary i have to go there let's have a look oh wow completely opposite side oh that was a that's a really hard round because it's got white soil and normally everywhere in western australia you have red soil yeah i was i wasn't thinking yeah it didn't look like western australia for me so so no no i wouldn't have guessed that that was a tricky one yeah again 15 000 points i'm i'm living on that 15 000 uh mark pretty good this time this time peter i believe you exceeded my expectation actually oh okay yeah okay so what i had was and 14 five okay okay so quickly thousand points ahead yeah quite close actually good prediction and the third game is is this even harder than the the first two yeah this one's this one's meant to be the hardest oh no oh no so 1038 okay oh yeah it is canada okay maximum i don't remember if this this particular looking sign was state specific or not but um it's definitely canada it feels like it is mountains we don't really see the mountains but but i don't know from the vibes i'm getting it it feels like it is like like a healey region we don't have even have the the plates here which which i could blame [Laughter] um rip lights to say no place to tease you yeah exactly i didn't realize that she was a candidate for each for each seed but yeah a lot of canada here could this bbc could this ever be bc or alberta bc alberta maybe like near calgary i don't know maybe somewhere there there isn't too too much to see here so i guess i'll just go there and then hope for the best oh that was an interesting one i had around there the other day and it completely fooled me so i thought it might fool you as well oh wow yeah where did you go uh i was playing chat sisters in the chattanooga sir oh okay okay but that was that was an ontario sign the one with the black oh it is ontario yeah yeah okay i thought it might have been state specific but but yeah again i couldn't remember oh what is this now oh gosh this one might be one for clues we'll see oh it i think so i think so when my first thought was like australian outback or something where's the sun the sun is south a little but but it's very low so doesn't mean too much well okay i'll ask the she has the country or the continent i mean in the in the case of australia it's almost the same i'm just thinking for the future rounds which one could be more helpful maybe okay i'll guess i'll ask the country is this australia this is australia okay nice okay so so i'm glad my first thought was right but again where look it doesn't look like a typical australia the soil is like super super dark i was watching your video where the ai was generating pictures and ai generated pictures for south australia looked very similar to this i have to say oh yeah but i think you were thinking it would be somewhere alice springs but a i had generated it in south australia if i remember correctly yeah that sounds about right yeah so i don't know i i think i'll go alice springs because in the video you guessed alice springs deferring it this is deferring the uh the blame exactly yeah yeah yeah if it's the springs you're at fault but okay let's let's get him there oh okay even more north than that okay well what's about there five rivers look out interesting one for sure the grass is very long that wouldn't be so long right in the middle of the outbacks oh okay yeah and also also also generation two in northern territory oh oh i didn't know that okay oh there's a doggo cute very cool oh he's running as well running doggo oh what do we have here oh this is so you were not kidding when you said it's going to be difficult yeah it's the hottest round i found for sure there is nothing here um there is the sun to the south no google car at all looking at the sand it feels quite coastal ah i think i'll ask for the continent on this one this is really tricky is this in europe this is in europe okay i was thinking could you have found like a cheeky latvia could this possibly be latvia i'm not really feeling latvian vibes here then again half of the time i can't recognize latvia so it feels kind of similar but but something feels off for a lot of you so i'm thinking maybe kind of something nearby some poland maybe or or one of the nordic countries coastal i'm inclined to maybe go poland if it isn't then then this area i'm thinking of baltic sea area let's see oh wow okay wrong sea yeah that was a really tricky when i wasn't thinking romania at all that was a really hard round that i was i was just so blown away when i saw her i was like wow yeah yeah well it was coastal it was coastal it felt very coastal but but i guess black sea coast looks quite similar to baltic sea coast at places certainly certainly can oh cheeky mongolia huh see how i know how well you know your mongolian regions shall we i don't i don't i was i was like showing my chat the other day the mongolian document that like 177 pages which is like insane like a whole book about mongolian car good bedtime rating that oh yeah for sure you'd be like knocked out immediately we have so yeah well we know it's mongolia but but yeah where i was thinking kind of northern mongolia maybe because it looks quite we have quite a lot of like green grass and and i feel like the northern mongolia in general is more green and a little bit hilly as well which which uh which would work i think let's go there super oh my literally the opposite side of mongolia yeah oh my gosh that was tough that is oh my very very off there isn't even a road there it's like in the middle of nowhere oh my god even if you know exactly where that is how are you meant to fight it's just exactly exactly oh this is a very interesting road very interesting road no car i'm getting russian vibes here against sandy sandy road this feels again super coastal to me russia has a pretty large coastline i would say yeah could this could this ever be somewhere up here near saint petersburg again very risky guess if i decide to go there now i'm thinking i should have been more way way more or harsh in my maps but okay let's go i don't hold back on these i never fall back on these we can say that much about me oh that's true that's true but okay i wanna risk it for the biscuit let's go somewhere up here maybe it's the lake coast maybe it's this this gulf coast but i feel like maybe somewhere here in russia okay okay not bad not bad it was more northern you know i wasn't thinking that northern though but 20 2700 for russia not too bad so let's see what you ended up with then let's see uh 99 hundred plus almost 10 000. so what were you predicting for me this time you just undershot it and my prediction was that you would get 11 022 points so basically a thousand off exactly okay yeah pretty pretty close again you were 7027 points away in terms of your prediction so for three games in total i think that's a that's a good good good score definitely definitely satisfied with that i think i think this is going to be close honestly i think so i think so we'll have to see but i feel like that's like a competitive score so oh for sure i hope you enjoyed this video don't forget to press that like button if you haven't already and go and check out zigzag's video in the description where i try to predict the scores he will get in my maps huge thanks to all the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see

bunch of different hats if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button and here we go so this is the map a world of hats made by lawn law all the play along links as always will be in the description let's do no moving one minute 30 seconds and let's go good luck everyone make sure to play them before watching this video so don't spoil anything of course so this is the this is the hard hat i think it was called in english right the construction workers and is this a policeman so we have these arrows these these overhead arrows that are actually quite helpful whenever you see these overhead arrows that's a really really good sign that you would be in a hokkaido island in japan also if you pay attention to meta we have this what we call low camera so the google car is a bit lower you get that in japan and switzerland and and sometimes taiwan and sri lanka and yeah driving the left side of course the language we had some language here some japanese don't have much time though but let's get somewhere um oh not bad actually not a bad guess very good guess 20 kilometers away but yeah the knowing that it was the hokkaido island really helps those those arrows coming in clutch so where is the hat here is that the hat oh that's a nice hat i have to say that's a nice hat um where are we oh dogos oh adorable adorable anyways these these brick these red brick houses would make me think something like maybe bolivia peru do we have any electricity counters here oh we have these round electricity counters we have some chinese here what interesting interesting papi chulo well i think with these electricity counters it has to be bolivia right because in peru the electricity counters are a bit different and in general these kind of red brick houses are more common in bolivia i'm gonna go le paz somewhere there maybe and let's see let's go happy with this guess pretty good start pretty good start oh this is an unofficial coverage what's the hat here okay okay kind of got to protect your your head from the sun it does seem like a sunny day we have a nice hat here in the background i like this hat to be honest very cool so this feels very nordic the houses the houses feel very very nordic the author's name is bjorlin gi tech jorlin does sound quite um nordic to me at least and here we have oh gosh where was this flag oh i think it was the um island flag wasn't wasn't it i hope i'm not wrong uh we probably can't trust the compass uh somewhere somewhere near i mean there's near water everywhere here maybe maybe closer to this coast oh okay fair enough i wouldn't have guessed there but still okay at least i recognized the flag that's not a flag that you often see so many of you might not have known it but even though with my bad oh god we have a beach even with my bad flag knowledge i knew that one luckily we have a lot of seals just chilling here in the sun sunbathing bunch of seals i've seen a very similar coverage ah and one of these islands down here was it the sandwich islands or falkland islands oh it might be something else but i i know for a fact that in one of these islands i remember having a location with a bunch of seals and uh penguins i i think i will go south south south georgia and the sandwich no no okay i'll go falkland island let's switch it um can we just the compass water to the east let's go somewhere here then maybe no okay it was a different location that i was thinking then oh wow it was the galapagos oh i wasn't thinking that interesting i know in galapagos you can get a lot of uh turtles gonna be big shells um yeah i hadn't seen really uh seals there we have a very cool hat almost looks like a leather possibly um green color felt very lithuanian the back says levi's so i don't think that that helps much uh we have generation two so not lithuania then this kind of yellow house giving me maybe kind of kind of finish vibes maybe we have this sign here which uh does feel very finnish these these kind of white street names signs you see a lot in finland sometimes in one language sometimes in finnish and swedish together oh we have a yellow sign here as well with a thick red border since since we only have one language on that street name let's go maybe somewhere here because i think more coastal here and here you get uh it was closed but it was kind of western coast you get both languages more like in turku and helsinki if i remember correctly and kind of up here but of course my finnish viewers please correct me in the comments if i say something incorrect uh so so as always the total score is nineteen thousand two hundred and six points pretty good i would say the only round the galapagos around okay let's do another one let's do another one again the link in the description is as always of course what do we have here we have a cool black hat here okay nice standard quite quick classical hat very interesting kind of this this this not really a bridge what do you call this kind of kind of thingy here you can see it feels quite european to me i have to say what's the author's name alexander boss bosciatsky okay where would this be would this be russia would this be russia i could see this being russia maybe kind of i don't know in this this area somewhere maybe maybe um sure let's try it's not like i'm gonna find any more clues okay it was it was russia it was even more north but i'm really happy with this guess actually because yeah i kind of got the right area in a huge country like russia so i'll take that i'll take that we have a white hat a nice hat a lot of really cool hats in this map i have to say we have some flags in the distance that i can't really see we have these these kind of metallic street names which i find very icelandic and yeah we have these these kind of interesting looking letters which you also see in iceland a little troll with a sword cute cute and also yellow yellow the road signs i'm assuming it's probably city center hotel it's probably rey cafe can we find city center hotel probably in the city center center hotels plaza don't have much time unfortunately yeah i guess we just keep it somewhere there and then hope for the best oh hey was it actually that hotel that's a 5k let's go always nice to get a 5k okay this is is that really a hat it's like like some like a padding i think they use to to even out the pressure of the thing they have on their heads right what do we have here these poles kind of kind of waffle poles i call them these waffle poles and the sun should be to the north right the sun is right in the middle okay but i was thinking this feels like madagascar to me this kind of kind of waffley poles and and this trekker coverage we have a different hat here in the distance we can't really see it that well looks like a a classical standard hat again but okay let's go madagascar let's go antananarivo maybe near the queen's palace somewhere more down here um i don't know if it would be here [Music] oh oh it was that close to the queen's palace wow okay i know there is some tracker coverage near queen's palace it just didn't feel that close to it but okay fair enough let's move on we have kali kala is okay i think you pronounce it it's in spanish it's spanish so we are in a spanish-speaking country we have this small antenna here which which which helps to narrow it down to a few countries alto that's a huge hint because alto you really get alto not in many countries you get it in a couple of central uh american countries and mexico uh so yeah this is definitely mexico here with alto this small antenna mexico is one of the countries that can have it these are mexican electricity counters although you can see them in some some central american countries too and we have a mexican flag there as well wait where was the where is the hat here this was the hat i'll be honest i'm not the biggest fan of these type of hats where you can like see through them yeah these these kind of edgy poles you get in mexico too so let's go mexico um i don't know which city this would be did it say something i don't think it says anything city related on that sign does it we have some hills okay it wasn't that bad of a gas actually it was a very small town i'm not sure how i could have guessed that uh town if i could have guessed that down in particular but okay let's move on let's oh gosh okay we have a have a simple black um i don't know how you call these type of hats in english tight hat a tight hat oh this flag oh is that a faroe island flag white with a red cross and some blue around this looks like a very interesting place some sort of a cave mission exploring caves i don't know where where in feral islands that they have caves but uh they do have mountains so why wouldn't they have caves let's go somewhere in that area up there okay not bad actually not bad actually it was kind of kind of even more north than i thought let's see total actually a really good game actually a really good game we had some official coverage some unofficial one 22 and a half thousand points okay let's go for another one let's go for the third one third time's the charm good luck everyone if you're playing along and if you're playing along let me know in the comments how you are doing i always enjoy reading reading your comments and replying to them of course we have this white google car not much else to see to be honest oh the hat we gotta check out the hat this type of hat very asian i feel like you see a lot of these hats in like vietnam but surely in other asian countries right because this is not vietnam this feels kind of like indonesia maybe we are driving on the left side yeah here and these kind of look like maybe faded indonesian flags possibly because you often see in indonesia they have like flags hanging around looking like this very cool looking houses these ornaments around i don't think this is java island i think this might be something like i don't know bali or or this one what is this lombok let's go bali let's go bali but oh wow it was all the way sulawesi okay interesting a very very small tiny road really fascinating that architecture you can't use architecture in indonesia to to distinguish the islands but i'm not the best i can i can oftentimes tell java island apart but the other ones sometimes sumatra as well but but the other ones i'm still still learning still learning myself where's the hat oh here's the hat oh that's a cool hat this is a very traditional looking bolivian um outfit i would say you see a lot of kind of kind of um elderly people wearing these traditional clothes in bolivia so i would go bolivia here what else we have some spanish of course i'm thinking which city would this be maybe la paz maybe it was it was it was a bit west a bit west of la paz a bit of a smaller city but uh good enough good enough i would say okay we have some some hats here oh this is a cool hat i like it i like it a lot of these people wearing some hats which is good hands are good i don't wear hats often myself though but i like hats i have no idea where this is uh we have the author's name is g hein gee hun we have some palm trees here looking quite tropical i was thinking maybe caribbean could this be by any chance we have some hills as well those caribbean islands are hilly this could be any island dominica will we go dominica let's okay let's go let's go here where was it antigua and barbuda let's go there ah okay i was very wrong with thinking that those were caribbean islands they were not what what what what isla de pasqua there's no chance i would have guessed there if anyone guess is there let me know how how did you know it was there we have some um language i'm looking thinking would it be thai i think it looks more loud laughing i don't know which is the correct term we said we are drawing the right side although what's concerning to me is that we don't have yellow plates so i'm thinking this is probably just cambodia yeah yeah encore yeah okay mixed up my languages i thought the language looks more la ocean or la lao lao was just khmer language they use in cambodia so yeah these encore beers you see a lot in cambodia that's a good clue yeah cambodia beer also a popular one where in cambodia i would go maybe kind of kind of kind of here-ish maybe let's see not really it was very eastern very eastern oh i didn't check the hats again oh this hat i like this hat this is a cool hat i like these big hats i don't really see men wearing these huge hats but but i really like how they look and let's go for the fifth round here we have a gentleman with a cap we have the polish science centrum centrum centrum i'm thinking this might be warsaw centrum what is centrum area is is this warsaw ah zero forty two was warsaw i think right what is the ulitza ulitza pon ponzevska something looks like a pretty big street going like that paul polzenska olazinska no no no no no i'm running out of time is this police with this this car no it's not it's not but the schnitzel no this is at least starting with the p but i don't know i was watch gosh darn it i thought 042 was warsaw though i guess i need to refresh my polish phone codes huh oh well well it was vodge but um only lost 400 points so so at least it was close-ish okay let's view the summary 16 148 points all in all decent rounds but yeah that island round the third one that was a tricky one if you played along let me know in the comments how you did in these games and on the right side there will be another play-along game i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patreons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a

every single country in the world if you enjoyed these videos don't forget to press that like button and here we go the mail that we'll be playing is called perfect 10. the play along links as always will be in the description make sure to play these games before watching this video so I don't spoil anything so here we go the first location oh God it's the beach location already y'all y'all know I don't like beach locations so the author is Dave LED jonasi okay I never know where to get some beach locations that's not good that is not good well at least we know it's Coastal that's something that's better than nothing so Sonia Sonia what are all of these umbrellas belonging to Sony oh why the world why do they all say Sonia this feels kind of maybe I was thinking maybe Caribbean maybe this feels a little bit Caribbean let's go Caribbean with the these mountains and and beaches Dominica let's go Dominica let's see how is it Dominica okay not bad actually not bad at all it was monzerat I think oh it was Antigua and Barbuda okay it didn't show up at first next round oh this is inside this is okay some sort of a church wow oh is this oh oh is this the famous famous uh Chapel in uh Vatican City the one that Michelangelo painted I I think I can't show the top there because because it's not not safe for work let's look let's look at this guy this guy is safe for work but where where where was that which one was it capella sistina I think that was the one capella sistina somewhere there okay good let's go I recognize the famous place I can't believe it Johan Chavez is the author of this one this is the next one what do we have we have um some Outlook emails electricity counter like this with some Spanish and these electricity counters would make me think I'm a Central America maybe we don't have any domain names here really Miriam's quetzales doesn't help me does it I'm sure it says the country here but I can't read it what what could it say there PanAm could it say Panama there acute doggo oh that's a flag what is that flag is that like Costa Rica flag no with some red white blue oh okay the timer it was Costa Rica flag oh I didn't realize we're running out of time if I noticed that I might have switched to Costa Rica actually but still Panama Costa Rica at least it was pretty close pretty close at least so almost 4 000 points there another Beach location can we stop with the beach locations please I do not enjoy them wait oh with this type of looking road with Beach very close on both um sides this makes me think that this is one of these uh oceani atolls like to follow maybe and no tuvalo look like has it would make sense right so I'm thinking we met might be somewhere in tuvalo or any other at all really but I think we might as well guess to wallow cause there isn't gonna be any other clues that we can see so I think we just go with to Value here oh my Lord it actually was to follow hey okay okay I'm on fire let's go I'm very happy with the challenge thus far the King of Kings new estate Baptist Church follow follow where is follow what is this country this is Nigeria right yeah this is Nigerian Google car like I guess let's try to find follow I'm thinking it might be somewhere this definitely feels near the water what kind of beach beachy location so let's try to find follow somewhere near Lagos maybe or somewhere here Paulo folu so weird have the timer up here I think they changed it recently it used to be on the right side but I guess it makes sense for it to be in the center I can't find it but I think it's it would be maybe somewhere in Lagos maybe let's see uh it was Coastal not in Lagos I ah we needed to zoom in more I was looking here but I guess I hadn't zoomed in enough to see follow unfortunate how did we do 23 000 points for the first game I think it was really really good if you're playing along let me know in the comments how you are doing but let's play another one let's play another game again challenge in the description the link Nixon piazzo is the author here oh Lord this looks like something that I will butcher I never know where to guess in these types of locations this just looks like it could be anywhere my first thought was kind of somewhere in Latin America something like Colombia Ecuador or one of the Central American countries maybe yeah besides the plants and mountains there really isn't anything to go by here so I guess just gotta go with the gut feeling you know that's that's gotta rely on the gut feeling that has developed many years playing geoguessr so let's go something like La Costa Rica to kind of cover this this whole area because I'm thinking it might be somewhere here well not the greatest start of this game let's let's hope the other rounds are better huh uh we are coastal we are coastal here okay um why is this sign facing the other way though because I don't think we would be driving in the left side here um I don't recognize these signs these types of mountains and Waters really makes me think kind of Norway could this be Norway maybe but I'm not sure about this sign though that's like a confusing one another thing that came to my mind was Switzerland maybe these these mountains feel more Norwegian though so again not too many Clues I was hoping for maybe finding some language but that's just the text is too far away and too blurry to read I wouldn't go too far north though somewhere here ish maybe it was Switzerland no no I was considering it I was considering it but I thought Norway was more likely Ah that's annoying at least I got some points better than my first round in this this game oh this is a really cool statue it looks like it might be like Dove the author's name isn't really readable it's looks like it might be Arabic oh we have a flag oh what is that flag oh is this like a Iraqi flag it looks like an Iraqi flag to me I'm not the greatest with flags I hope I'm not mixing my flags up but when we have green flags here I'm not sure we have one red plate some white plates I think this is an Iraqi flag right I think I guess we'll find out in 15 seconds but I would I would guess Iraq I would guess Iraq let's go back Dodd just because it's Capital the capital and hopefully okay it was a rock it was and not the capital though but I don't think I could have known it wasn't the capital in case I missed something some obvious Clues let me know in the comments but I don't think I could have known it was that particular City there okay another difficult round here I would say we have a yellow plate which um we said I was driving on I think the steering wheel is on the opposite side should mean that we're driving the left side and the general Vibes my first thought was kind of Oceania possibly so driving the left side could could work because a lot of a lot of those countries do drive on the left side but we have we have youth something so English speaking apparently I don't know which countries have yellow plates or any other ones let's go I don't know Samoa should we go Samoa Samoa which said is Samoa driving on I'll be honest I'm not even sure okay it was Oceania not not Samoa it was Solomon Islands apparently well The Vibes were right again I'm not sure how I could have known when it was here exactly besides getting lucky here we have okay Something official coverage for a change that's nice can I recognize what country this is though we have when seeing this car my first thought was Peru but looking like this though not not your typical Peru so I'm thinking maybe Argentina where is the sun the sun is to the north I think behind the mountain looks very nice but but oh yeah this is Argentinian yeah this is Argentinian sign yeah yeah this is Argentinian sign for sure so this would be Argentina looking at the nature I would say this is quite Southern right we have what what the water is to our West the road is going like that uh no it's not gonna be there somewhere no that's that's Chile ah I don't have time to like pinpoint it somewhere he here oh okay it wasn't as South as I thought huh Whoopsie Daisy I mean the mountains make perfect sense here but yeah just felt more Southern how did we do in total much worse than the first game only 9 000 points so if you play along you have a great opportunity to beat my score on that one but let's play another one one more game and hopefully I do better than 9000 on this one what do we have we have unofficial coverage here the author is James Hong these stuff of houses are very American to me with these kind of doors to some like Outdoors about balconies in a way like these type of houses you don't really see them in Europe that much so I'm thinking maybe some somewhere in Caribbean because of that now the primary school well if I knew where nounty is I would be golden right now but well I don't North and South oh so we can trust the compass here it works so if it is north then the sun is to the north huh we might be in Oceania then again one of these I don't know Wallis and Fortuna no probably not there oh we don't have time I was trying to maybe thinking maybe to try and find Nauti but let's just get Samoa again it was to Valu oh very close to to the previous game we had I don't even see Nauti here anymore I'm not sure whether it's a naughty school it's not even on the map was it misplaced by any chance I'm not sure weird weird oh another official one with a white Google card this time the sun is to the north well this feels like Southern Africa but uh would this be something like what would this be I guess I could see this being es withini there are quite a lot of lot of greenery on the mountains this doesn't really feel like Lesotho to me at all so I'm thinking probably eswatini or South Africa a very small road so let's just guess somewhere I think and hope for the best but again I hope it is this within your South Africa it was eswatini nice well very close to the eastern border huh okay I'm happy you recognized it oh okay some some church again I I should not zoom in on the artwork too much because there seemed to be a lot of naked people there I don't want to get demonetized but yeah there is a lot of artwork here with some uh is that Latin I think the author's name is Xavier Goldberg Amy so either it's some sort of a museum or a church one of the two it reminds me of that uh Vatican round we had recently the style is very similar to that Vatican round we had so I think I'm gonna go with that with Vatican again I'm not sure I'm thinking it might be like again Saint Peter's Basilica like a different room maybe and let's let's hope for the best it was not the Basilica it was a different building but it was still the Vatican City so I'll I'll take that any day of the week round number four Hugo uster camp Oh is the author here so this this might be Hugo we have a wide plate we have some murals here interesting ones hmm well this is somewhere in Africa but but where I can't tell which side we're driving on I think we just make an educated guess it looks quite hilly very green so green and hilly in Africa Zambia I don't know Angola looks like it's quite hilly here-ish maybe maybe Tanzania Tanzania is quite hilly let's go Tanzania actually let's go there and hope for the best oh not bad not bad at all it wasn't Tanzania it was Mozambique I'm pretty happy with that score because it was a very difficult round in my opinion oh what is this here Muhammad D is the author very nice building here looks like a hotel probably no no Hotel name or anything some sort of a shop this is giving me Middle East Vibes like some some sort of a rich core expensive cool art can't see the language oh can't really read it I'm thinking one of the one of the Middle Eastern countries like maybe Qatar somewhere in Doha or Bahrain somewhere here I would say let's go Doha let's go Doha I think oh oh it was just UAE so so it was UAE Dubai similar Vibes it was just just Dubai mocella the views Emar how did we do in total 19 000 not bad I'm very happy with this because there were some really tricky rounds here again if you played along let me know in the comments what your scores were and on the right side there will be another Play Along video I think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and

satellite videos press that like button and here we go today we're going to play a map called world cities so hopefully we don't get locations in the middle of nowhere the player long links as always will be in the description make sure to play them before watching this video so don't spoil anything so what do we have what do we have we do have a pretty big city here that we didn't see it i feel like i have seen this city from above before but i don't recognize it i probably should recognize it but let's zoom in is this like budapest or something feels european doesn't it we have some sort of a big church here shadows are very long so the sun is basically just rising it looks like a little bit to the north so europe would fit is this hungary or is this something else though i think kiev looked different it also had a river going through but i don't think this is kiev oh there's an airport here does that help us at all we do have a couple of runways some stadiums that don't help much either this definitely feels like you're kind of getting german vibes a little bit but my first guess was hungary let's check out hungary but looking at the house roofs i could see this being something like germany maybe as well okay yeah it is not hungary not not gonna be budapest not not vienna vienna had the river going in a different angle would this be burl no this isn't berlin is it yeah it isn't berlin yeah what would it be we have a tram we have a tram here hmm would this be warsaw no no it isn't warsaw no okay it's cologne okay i was thinking it kind of looks german but but i totally checked berlin i should have checked other other german cities so it's cologne okay okay makes sense the river aligns perfectly so where are we we are near a bridge one of the many bridges so i think we are somewhere here next to the pizza pasta i think we are right there let's go 16 meters good start oh no what is this let's zoom out hopefully we get a bigger city okay we do get a bigger city than that okay some wherever this is there are a lot of tiny islands like on this on this coast where would this be looks very interesting looks like a big city but huh okay the shadows are going definitely to the north we are driving on the right side that makes sense some big roads here like four lanes in each direction which would make me think u.s maybe or or canada we do have some football fields a bunch or soccer fields as my american viewers would say i don't think you would get that many football fields in north america would you i don't think football is super popular there we have like a outdoor swimming pool what's happening here it's like oslo or something could it be i'm not sure if oslo looks like this from above let's have a look no no no it isn't no gottenberg no pow league doesn't help that's an international company i mean looking at the houses they do feel definitely more european the houses the the streets themselves definitely feels more european than american where in europe would it look like this denmark could it be no there is an airport here a big one as well i mean it looks like a big city postie was was possibly finnish or or am i tripping does it align with helsinki he does align with helsinki ah okay that explains things because i feel like i had checked all the other big cities that it could have been for some reason i didn't check helsinki but i was thinking postie i think i've seen it in finland before okay so this is helsinki okay looks really really nice from above i have to say so we would be somewhere on this thing up here ish i think we are like here ish let's go let's go i am really enjoying this map to be honest it's not too difficult but it's still a little bit challenging in my opinion from above at least oh my this is a oh oh my lord this is a big city wow this is like something like uh well it's not new delhi what else would it be it's it's literally so massive it's insane that's what she said uh but what city could this be oh my it's it's enormous what do we have here we have some sort of like like some sort of palace whenever i see like like some kind of palace or like a garden like this it makes me think in the middle east kind of kind of uzbekistan one of the stan countries like these these types of gardens or like fields and stuff i mean i don't know if it is or not i'm just saying what what comes to my mind first it's it's i'm still stunned by how huge the city is it's just insane we are driving on the right side yes where are the shadows going the shadows are going a little bit to the north yeah and of course we have a massive airport as well as as you would expect in such a big city so it's it's not going to be tehran the granted mountains to the north so we have mountains to our west we have an airport in the middle of the city and then some sort of like a water reservoir to the east of it there are some very green parts and some quite dry looking parts as well i was thinking like ankara maybe but doesn't really fit i think this map only had official coverage but i'm not 100 sure i mean i know it's not new delhi but but maybe it's a different big city there are a couple something like hyderabad no oh but india would be driving in the left side we are drawing the right side here so it wouldn't be india then i am kinda stumped here i don't know what this is so such a big city driving in the right side northern hemisphere red roofs this isn't like mexico is it wait it is mexico no oh my god i was thinking the roofs kind of feel mexican i guess i should have paid attention to the roofs a bit earlier okay so this is mexico city oh boy okay i'm glad i decided to to have a look at the roofs because i was focusing more on the size of the city rather than the roofs and another basic clues um i think we would be somewhere here right below this kind of kind of circle okay 80 meters away let's go let's go what's the next location number four okay something coastal oh something big oh something coastal and something big my first thought was brazil but um is it i'm not sure but let's have a look what do we have oh this is kind of very interesting coverage kind of from the side the satellite view unusual that's for sure so the shadows appear to be going to the south which said are we driving on i think we're driving the right side yeah i think yeah yeah we are driving the right side okay it took me a while to verify it but we are arriving on the right side here now would this be brazil actually could the rules be brazil the robes look very interesting i have to say kind of like almost built on top of each other which i feel like i have seen something like that in south america these types of red roofs do feel kind of latin american i would say so oh there is an airport here we can maybe try to use it to recognize the city it is a big city it is a very big city on the coast of a big river when i first saw this i was thinking maybe some of the somewhere up here northern brazil look look somewhere here but i i don't think this yeah that doesn't fit bellam oh is it i think it is i think it is it yes yes yes okay my first thought was right even though my first star was brazil i still wanted to verify and look for for additional clues just just to make sure but now the big problem is gonna be pinpointing it it's in the middle of all this this maze of street so we have these two streets here i think we are here hospital do we have hospital here is that hospital i mean is this whole hospital i mean it's connected here yeah yeah we have hospital here and then another part here i think yeah i think we are spot on here-ish let's go let's go one last round in this game this is a pretty city another coastal one i feel like we're getting lucky with some coastal cities because i think coastal cities are easier to find from the first glance i have no idea what country this would be though so we need to do some investigative work which said are we driving on here the quality isn't the best i can't tell i think we might be driving in the left side here yeah i think we are driving the left side here okay and the shadows appear to be going to the south so we would be in the southern hemisphere right in the left side southern hemisphere i'm not sure if this is an island nation or not we're definitely coastal do we have a pretty big airport here pretty big one i am thinking oceania right now just because driving left and coastal a lot of options uh like that in oceania but but won't no no one particular country pops into my mind could this be one of the japanese islands but but i think all of them are in northern hemisphere still yeah [Music] is it actually darwin it is oh okay i i decided to check darwin because but i didn't have any better ideas it actually is dark okay wow huh well australia wasn't my first thought that's for sure but it was like the only thing that really made sense because this doesn't really look like an island nation looks too big okay so this would be somewhere i think we're like here i think i hope oh i got a new badge i got a new badge perfect score let's go and a perfect game these were some easier rounds i have to say but let's play another one again link in the description if you want to play along you don't need to have a geographer pro or anything to play along free version is enough another coastal city getting a lot of coastal ones i have to say i don't recognize this one immediately a big city definitely a big city so hopefully i can get it we have an airport here on the left side but my first thought was kind of um seattle but but seattle would have more islands here right so yeah seattle would have a bunch of islands on the left side so this wouldn't be seattle the shadows are going to the north yeah the the streets are very grid like so which you see a lot in uh america north america so yeah you don't really see grid like streets like this in europe usually so so even though this isn't seattle i still think this would be um north america us or canada what would this be we have some palm trees huh okay so this is more southern than i thought at first because we do have a bunch of palm trees uh everywhere with the water to the left it wouldn't be oh wait vikings l.a joel la jolla vikings well as we found out in one of the previous videos we gotta gotta take these team names with a pinch of salt because apparently they might be somewhere completely us but um la la something so let's explore l.a good old los angeles is this i don't think it is is it what is this san diego where is san diego oh okay okay that that that that that's good that's good not too far from los angeles i might be going to san diego soon not sure maybe maybe we'll see but anyways we have we are somewhere like around here ish i think we are like here yeah right next to salt and straw let's go good first round oh this looks this looks more difficult doesn't look coastal for a change oh yeah this looks definitely more tricky not coastal very mountainous okay okay so let's zoom in let's try to find any clues that we can get we have a big stadium without any texts unfortunately that would help we have some sort of a river here going through the city some pretty dark brown kind of brown roofs on most houses shadows are going to the north so we would be in the northern hemisphere we are driving the right side as well we have some football fields again and some blue roofs i can't put my finger on it where are we a lot of agricultural fields i think it could just be something like sofia i know there are like mountains to the south of sophia um so let's let's have a look could this be sofia maybe not really doesn't look like it this city looks kind of more stretched out than sophia could this be scorpio it is kind of stretched out i can see some similarities with skopje do we have like a river going through like that there is a small river going through it is it actually is yeah the river matches perfectly okay oh okay i'll admit it i get a bit lucky here cause cause scorpio was the second second city that i checked after um sofia just felt like it might be it kind of in that area okay so we are south of this this kind of river somewhere here ish i think this might be that big building that we see vero this might be that long longer one somewhere there one meter away let's go let's go round number three okay now is this is this seattle because this time we do have some some islands on the left side and again you might notice we have these kind of grid grid roads very kind of grid like vertical and horizontal that are very uh north american we have some sort of a stadium which is like both a football field and an american football field two in one no no texts though we have an airport here we have another airport here a bigger one this is definitely a big city before just going to seattle and comparing i'm trying to look for some some more clues to to make it more interesting we are definitely driving in the right side the quality is really good you can we can really zoom in on these cars that's an impressive quality i have to say we have some baseball fields a football field some tennis courts as well very sporty and active city that's good that's good so i guess we might as well just just have a look at seattle see if it actually is it does that align i think it does a line yeah this kind of a bay this bay aligns perfectly here yeah yeah it is seattle this time okay perfect perfect so we are american cities are always a hassle to pinpoint because all the streets look exactly the same from above okay we have these double towers here so one two three blocks from there one two three blocks so i think we are here oh yeah and we have this triangular house here yeah yeah okay perfect let's go let's go the from the first glance felt kind of spanish but okay we are coast is this barcelona this this oh yeah it is definitely barcelona barcelona looks so unique from above plus i'm very happy that i got spain from literally like like what was we're like zoomed in like this felt spanish immediately somehow but barcelona looks so unique from above these kind of kind of like square cells all over the city looks super unique super unique so this is definitely barcelona and also water to the southeast of course this this is the easiest round of today i feel we have this park here this is the that bigger house i think we're right here ish el some cultural space very historical city i would love to visit barcelona it looks amazing and this one looks and another easy one oh my okay we're ending on an easy note this this is such a unique a unique um project the world which seems kind of pointless but rich people are gonna do rich people stuff i guess but sure so we are near this river so here is that river so we have this road here we would be right somewhere here 23 meters away that's still a perfect score let's go let me know in the comments how you did in these games and on the right side there will be another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and

flags around the world but they will be in the wrong country don't forget to press that like button and here we go the play along links as always will be in the description just make sure to play the game before watching this video so don't spoil anything so let's go let's go where's the flag that's an irish bob irish flag at the irish pub but this is not ireland so we are driving on the right side we have english no no we don't have english it looks like french why do we have yellow pedestrian crossings that's kind of weird no front plates oh is this like quebec with french no front plates yellow lines in the middle it's certainly not france so yeah something like quebec monreal somewhere somewhere in that area monsieur john john i think i kind of want to go monreal i don't know why let's let's see it was quebec city okay fair enough fair enough but still got the country right that's good what do we have next um okay we have a many flags many flags well this like a u.n building or something uh what do we have direction regular is this brussels maybe strasbourg oh strasbourg would make sense as well with all of these these flags strasbourg has some i think international organizations there zero three france yeah i mean cars of course can't travel but strasbourg would make sense what kind of a building could this be since they're a big international building i wouldn't know but uh parliament european parliament oh yeah it is a round building to our south somewhere here i think no yes oh i don't have time to align it okay perfect okay that turned out to be a good guess that's nice that's at least one perfect score that i'm happy with that even if i don't get any more in this video so we have a north korean flag huh this is like some sort of an embassy where do they have north korean embassies there were a couple of countries i think sweden have one maybe i'm wrong this isn't sweden though is this russia means kaya ulitza means kaya street well minsk is the capital of belarus but this is russia that are you um something about moscow i mean if we have some sort of a north korean i'm assuming embassy capital would make sense plus it does say moscow on this sign so i i'm gonna go moscow then huh i don't think there is point to try to find it in 15 seconds let's just guess in the middle okay i think i'm doing pretty well thus far um that's a canadian flag that's a us flag okay so still could be one of them dot ca we have a canadian domain name so this might be canada now open huh i know in canada they have these yellow um traffic lights in quite a lot of cities not sure if it's they are as common in the u.s i wouldn't know which city to guess i don't even see if we have front plates on the cars so that's not good i guess i'll go calgary it could be vancouver maybe i don't think it's like quebec because i didn't see any french maybe toronto oh it was oh it was very close to the border niagara falls huh maybe it said somewhere niagara falls i didn't see as always if i missed something let me know in the comments because i missed something basically in every video as i have found out um this looks like a uae the flags here are the is that a eu flag or kosovo flag and an irish flag sort of a hotel it has a bunch of different flags but yeah this is uae because we have some arabic here some very big and rich expensive looking buildings and of course if we're talking about meta we have a rift in the sky which you sometimes see in the uae and a white google car i would probably say dubai don't really see burj khalifa but it could easily be behind this uh or this building for example so let's go somewhere here let's i don't know okay was was a bit more to the south even okay but it was dubai so still got a pretty good score let's do the summary 19.5 000. yeah that canadian round screwed my my score over let's try it again let's try it again again link in the description my goal is to beat let's say 22 000 that would be nice so let's have a look what we have dot czed where's the flag i don't see maybe this is a new coverage maybe there used to be a flag somewhere here but now it isn't we have another dot cz domain name behind us so i'm pretty sure this would be czechia actually also the language here this is czech with this r letter with a thingy on top i think is the city here can we find kunovic unfortunately if i had more time maybe i could find it but oh it was so small uh no way i could have found it what is next mexico with the flag and everything i have a suspicion this is mexico so but what is it uh this is europe getting kind of um kind of kind of montenegro serbia vibe somewhere in that area oh i think it says ulita there how do we have rifts in the sky no no we don't what do we have we have blue smiley oh yellow sm if you have yellow smiley on the google car it is near slovonski broad i have seen blue smiley on on the google car before but i don't remember where it was i have forgotten i have forgotten but would that be croatia still i could see this being croatia even though we have many blue strips on the cars which you usually don't see in this google coverage market serbia maybe because this is not a croatian pedestrian crossing center it looks serbian i think oh slovenian ah i always forget that you can get these types of pedestrian crossing signs in slovenia as well because these ones are the usual ones but anyways still not a too bad of a score so we have a british cafe a taste of britain here in saskatoon well i think this might be saskatoon so can i find saskatoon where was it saskatoon here it was right in the middle so what's the road direction basically vertical what else do we have here we have a mcdonald's liquor store oh there was the mcdonald's yeah and here is the churchill's british cafe i really needed to zoom in only two kilometers away i think we're on track to get those 22 000 points uh this looks like the flag of cyprus so what would this be is this greece yeah the language would fit agree with greece water is to our south west probably this is one of the many many greek islands which one go figure if we had some phone numbers phone numbers can be super helpful in greece but uh we don't we don't have them let's guess somewhere in the middle one of these islands maybe somewhere here or here water to south or south southwest maybe we are in pirgaki why not no it was thessaloniki huh okay i guess it was a bigger city than i thought whoops next one we have a french flag in the eu flag in is this israel we have some yellow plates it looks like we might have some hebrew some palm trees yeah i think it says il on that license plate which would stand for israel also another thing is that these curbs white and red curbs also you see quite regularly in israel so this would be somewhere somewhere in israel do we go tel aviv jerusalem i feel like in tel aviv it would feel kind of more tropical with more bigger palm trees and such so i'm gonna go jerusalem on this one it was jerusalem yeah how did we do in total and twenty one point one thousand ah a little bit off our twenty two thousand goal let's try it for the third time maybe we can get those twenty two thousand maybe so we have a hungarian flag um sh cola so this okay we have montenegrin flags here so this would be montenegro montenegro is a relatively small country so that is nice this looks like an embassy so i guess this would be podgorica then what's the road direction maybe we can try to find it a little bit uh kind of diagonal i could not find a oh i did not find the the um embassy but my random plonk was not far at all again you need to zoom in so close i guess copy shop and hotel new star is more important than embassy of hungary huh okay next round this looks nice we have an italian flag bar italia now where would it be we have some yellow signs here which would make me think maybe something like sweden we have yeah we have four um these stripes on pedestrian crossing which you get in sweden in finland you would have five of these stripes oh and these these signs are very typical in sweden too these kind of these yellow ones so this would be sweden then bar italia very beautiful church big and beautiful church so probably big city then i mean it does look like a big city so would this be stockholm would this be a different one do we have any any city clues here bistro classical yeah i'm not sure about the city let's go let's go stockholm i think and hope for the best i was goltenberg not sure how i could have gotten that maybe swedish viewers if you know let me know in the comments how i could have known it was goltenberg now what would this be where's the flag first of all doesn't seem that we have flag here again might be a new coverage this looks like it might be an embassy of some sorts so so maybe there used to be a flag here i can't really read any language either here which is not good i have no idea where we are impressed i'm confused i'm just confused in this location i'll be honest i don't know what this is i can't really read the language this is generation four i'm leaning hungary but i really don't know oh wait we have oh sdr strada then strada that would be romania because in the hungary street meet is uttsah but in a romania it is strada so let's use bucharest because i thought yeah because it looked like we had the embassy lebanese okay it was lebanese embassy that we saw i wonder why they have removed the lebanese flag from their embassy usually embassies have their flags hanging proudly we have a bolivian flag again an embassy probably embajada quito ecuador well thank you i guess this is quito ecuador well that that helps it looks like we have a big big part of the city to our south uh southwest yeah we have ecuadorian domain name here as well so that's for sure ecuador big part of the city tour south west so we might be somewhere up here what's the wrong direction okay it is like this diagonal not too much time to try to find it but we can try yeah yeah we are out of time already let's just just keep it somewhere up here wasn't as far north as i thought it was bolivian embassy next we have meals of lossy what with italian gelato like an ice cream quite tasty i have to say i've had it once it was it was pretty good but the without looking around i would say well we have english i would say this is probably uk could be ireland but yeah we have these yellow backplates it is uk driving the left side of course with these types of brick houses it feels very scottish to me and also we have these bullards these french-style bowlers you can see them in uh scotland sometimes does it say the city by any chance beaver bridges is lossy mouth is lossy mouth the place moire council wait morey i think i've heard of moray before is moray a city moray lossymouth is up here i did not expect lossymouth to actually be a city name but okay i guess we are in lossy mouth so we have oh we ran out of time ah i wanted to try to pinpoint it but okay 499 i will still take it i'm surprised that i found lossy mouth in time let's do the summary okay 23.5 000 if you played along let me know how you did in these games and on the right side there will be another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all the patrons and youtube

we're gonna play a very interesting map with locations only indoors the play along links as always will be in the description make sure to play them before watching this video the locations in this map might be kind of kind of weird interesting maybe not the greater greatest quality sometimes but let's see hopefully we still have fun so what do we have we have like a toyota dealership to start it off with okay what's the author pro vr 3d okay doesn't help much le retor fantastique sounds quite french to me we we so this would be french is this france or is this one of the many many overseas territories with these palm trees i don't think it's mainland france in europe i would think this might be somewhere like a reunion maybe reunion is quite tropical and french-speaking i'm not finding any other clues just just some french language here so i guess let's go reunion i i feel it might be there could be of course another french island somewhere they have a bunch all around the world that's another french-speaking island chose the wrong one unfortunately principles principales corsarios piratas del caribe caribbean pirates i mean this is a museum about caribbean pirates doesn't have to be in caribbean but i'm assuming it might be a lot of guns [Music] is this a map of an island i don't know is it one of these islands somewhere probably not nothing seems to fit very well but i would still go with somewhere in caribbean if it isn't in caribbean i will be very disappointed let's go guadalupe well it wouldn't be french let's go puerto rico why not let's go there okay not bad not bad it was cuba pretty decent score at least we got some points because this is a difficult map this is a difficult map to get any points so so i'm happy with 2000 we have very colorful scars and textures here and then heads head scarves so uh i'm thinking africa because i know they really like colorful colors there can we read anything uh swiss something swiss voil what is voil i don't know rock star rock star well i don't think we are in switzerland well i think we are somewhere in africa but but which country it's a complete guess i think i saw like a video about ghana where they had like a very colorful colorful clothing so let's guess ghana why not maybe it's gonna maybe it's nearby maybe it's not let's see okay it was the gambia could be worse again 1500 points i'll take any point that i get on this map because it is tricky okay we're we're at the dentists in the dentist's office with i don't think it's the actual view of the place i i have a sneaky suspicion that's not a real window for some reason so we could use these um electricity outlets try try to help us this one looks kind of european style with those two dots i'm not sure if they use them in asia as well i know they don't use them in like us or or uk france let's go france paris uh oh lebanon okay well close to europe close to europe well i don't know what to say 800 points yay could be worse could be yours and we are in some sort of a store like a coffee shop andy ford is the author sour cream and onion some english on this this packaging i i i don't know cookie nutella root snack a lot of english i'm thinking could this be the philippines maybe that doesn't feel european just going by the god feeling on this one because there really isn't much else to go by i think i'm going philly the philippines here well it was europe it was greece apparent i didn't see a single greek letter there i didn't see a single greek letter what the hell 5 200 points in total now we can do better challenge not single player and let's go i i know i can do better than that blower vac square combi system trimmers so english again english pump shop tonga wait does it say tonga are in tonga well where was tonga now the challenge is to find tonga where was it here is tonga do they have like like a is this like a husqvarna shop or is this just like a regular um well everything is from cuckoo square so i'm guessing it's probably like for some a brand shop can we find a husqvarna shop in tonga that would be pretty epic if we managed to 5k this a lot of churches that i noticed they're literally church on every corner in tonga not couldn't why did it say tonga it was australia lawnmower service lovely in albany australia and i thought i thought we had something oh well what is this some some some some old building church domes i don't know something old i'm getting but by this style i'm getting maybe kind of maybe southern europe middle eastern vibes author is akram um with a name like that i would probably lean more towards middle east than europe i want to guess something like jordan maybe or or syria let's go syria maybe damascus somewhere in this area maybe okay not bad not bad it was gonna be in the area in the right area i'll take this 3 300 points more than more than half of the previous game already kole vira del gaba made in italy are we in italy or is this just a i guess it might be just an italian wine doesn't mean anything baron arks baron arks um the outside we do have some palm trees quite tropical looking chateau husk that sounds that sounds french yeah so this carpet where would you get a carpet like that i guess many many countries in the world i i don't know where to guess i am torn i want to get something like india india bangladesh let's go bangladesh maybe it was france this map is tough i'm telling you if you're playing along let me know how you are doing are you good are you doing better than me because cause the bar isn't very high oh no okay we have some like car mechanics shop can't really read what it says there a lot of trophies so i guess good mechanics here the outside very we have some red soil what is this map is that a country is that like suriname no it isn't surin no no no no it isn't kind of similar shape but no author is ze ver holland i'm thinking it might be south america brazil or something maybe this this is a shape of one of the brazilian states maybe it was brazil it was brazil was it state of moto gross so that the shape can't really tell maybe it was maybe it wasn't either way next location welcome xxxx okay very welcome we have a parrot oh this this looks like a nice place to stay actually the author is thai mac could we be in thailand because of that don't really see any language which could tell us if we are in thailand or not but i could see this being thailand it does look quite tropical outside so why wouldn't it be thailand okay let's go let's go with thailand because of the author's name mainly oh my it was saint lucia i literally guess the opposite side of the world here and let's go for the third game i hope i can beat 5 000 in this one hopefully hopefully okay somewhere very religious the author is cedo hutinar doesn't help me i wouldn't know oh we have some text we have some cyrillic moly zanas something something so maybe russia maybe somewhere in that area it looks like we have this j letter you don't usually get in russian so could this be something like serbia because i think you can get that j in like serbian language outside we don't see much we see a big tree and some some bushes i i want to go serbia here because of the jail letter but it might be some old old script not used anymore who knows but okay let's go with serbia let's go with my god and hope for the best not bad okay it was bosnia herzegovina fair enough 4 000 points already good start great start i'm happy with that a very yellow room here with some tea nice i like tea fruit some very tropical fruit here so i would assume this is a quite tropical place the author's name is yasas ati paula again doesn't help much i feel like the author's names has been more damaging than helping me in this game oh the the power outlet is not european at all we have these three uh three three plugs so i'm thinking maybe caribbean again i'm not sure what what power outlets they use in asia would they use or oceania but i i think they use these in caribbean i really should study my power outlets of the world they could really be helpful especially in these um inside locations probably not not in the usual geo guest sir you don't usually see power outlets in the regular one but if you're getting some inside locations power outlets is the big big clue okay let's get guadalupe okay it was age apparently in sri lanka they do use these power outlets with three holes now i know now i know a whole one point nice okay we have some chinese is that de port is that portuguese chinese portuguese would make me think macau if we have chinese and portuguese zona de something in some english are we doing the left side here i think we are it looks like we are doing the left side we have black plate as well i think this should be macau is this like an airport this feels like it could be an airport possibly where is there an airport in macau airport international de macaul maybe we are somewhere here maybe somewhere fairy no this hmm oh my lord okay i was not sure at all i guess it was the ferry terminal or something it looked like this would be a place where you would gonna collect passengers or something yeah i'm so happy that i got one perfect score in this map that's so cool yes okay next round we have some cyrillics happy birthday moosh that's husband but anyways would this be russia or uh it looks like it could be russian from what i can see here from this text i don't speak russian very well but some some basic basic knowledge so the language looks like looks russian to me so i guess i would go russia outside can't really tell looks regular doesn't look very tropical let's go something like why not let's go ufa oh was okay what's turkmenistan interesting that this is turkmenistan do they use cyrillic in turkmenistan or is it just like a russian shop in turkmenistan that's a possibility as well last round of this game i i this is already my high score so i'm happy about that so what do we have here 360 vr mohamed raza is the author so again if i'm mispronouncing the names it does look like we have some some either arabic or uh persian or or some some language that i can't read and with that with the author's name muhammad it would it would suggest that we might be kind of in the middle eastern area also these these types of tables these these tiles i feel like you see a lot also in that area so it all kind of adds up to maybe iran i think i'm going to guess it in iran because it's sort of in the middle of where i'm thinking it could be so let's go around ah oh it was egypt okay fair enough i think i did very well at this game with a whole 12.7 thousand points on the right side there will be a different play along video that i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful silver day be kind to one another and see you

looking at the location both from above and looking from the regular street view all the play along links as always will be in the description just make sure to play them before watching this video so don't spoil anything as i mentioned in the intro we're gonna play switching between the regular view and satellite view we'll see how that goes so the first location what we that we have here looks very rural shadows going to the north it seems so we should be in the northern hemisphere here um the quality isn't the best are we driving the left side here wait no the shadows are going a little bit to the south so we should be in the southern hemisphere then hmm and if we are driving left from what it seems we could be something in like like uh south africa maybe or or could this be a sutu from above let's have a look from the regular view okay we do have a yellow um yellow sidelines matsiang driving on the left side so this is definitely southern africa a lot of tree i think this is too many trees for lesotho i don't think you would get that this many trees in lusudu i think this might be either just south africa or could be esvatini maybe matsieng and moria let's go back to the satellite view matsiang and moria i feel lesbatini would be greener looking from above it might be near lesotho somewhere let's have a look at lesotho as well just in case moria oh here we go mori yeah matsien okay i guess this is lesotho i thought lesotho wouldn't have that many trees i guess this is a pretty green area in lesotho so we are in a road going kind of like this with the with a basically an et intersection where do we have a t intersection here so we were i think the sense that we are in maurya oh is there a t-intersection somewhere here are we on this one no no no it doesn't align and this one no no wait is it we have this kind of kind of big to 290 degree angles here does that work i think it works yeah i think i think this is the intersection so we would be right here okay nice good job we figured the first one out the signs definitely helped without those street signs that i would struggle okay a lot of circular kind of fields always they always look very interesting when i see them this feels okay more and more kind of urban more urban a lot of red roofs could this be europe with this many red roofs where is the sun going shadows are going to the north so that would fit wait are we drawing we are driving on the right side i'm getting kind of mediterranean vibes and spain portugal italy those those areas what other clues do we get from above can't really tell which one of those countries it is from above if i had to guess i would probably go portugal okay let's have a look from the street level where are we is this spain is this portugal or italy yeah yeah these are portuguese plates we are in portugal okay got the country right from above let's go always happy about that i can't really read the street name was hotel yeah i'm not sure where in portugal we would be don't see any any like city clues here i know i can move around technically but but i'm not gonna i guess let's try to find the city from above we have a small river which could help and the city is north of the river so let's let's try portugal isn't too big so we have a chance of finding it at least yeah i could not find it unfortunately i looked all over portugal up and down left and right but this this river seems to be too small i let's have a look it'll get quite quite close to lisbon very very small river uh still 400 points not bad not bad okay the shadows are going north we have something very rural so probably very difficult to find we are in an intersection with some sort of a monument or something here and i'm not sure driving on the right side think it could this be russia or something my first thought would be russia maybe or we have a lake some sort of uh there isn't much to go by here there isn't really even a city nearby just just this town with some houses that all look the same we have some blue roofs some red roofs which i think would mat would fit with maybe russia but let's some hills around as well let's have a look we in from street view okay so so this is that monument is this okay this is russia this is russia yeah we have these uh signs with black bottoms we have this long antenna we have these thick bollards russians love to put bollards everywhere [Music] and this feels quite eastern maybe quite eastern i'm guessing that might be this uh the place name rig uzu pretty mountains with this lake i think is the biggest clue here let's let's try to find this lake just notice there is a place called mama not that it helps but just thought it's funny like with these mountains it would need to be quite eastern right i think because we do have some some pretty high mountains in the distance it seems with snowy tops i tried to look for the lake i tried to look for a rig uzu couldn't find it in the east what if it isn't east i don't know arig oh wait uh arghi pagi kind of similar name not really the same but there's a place called airport finding some really interesting place names but not the one that i'm looking for i kind of want to go here but i'm not sure if there are this high mountains nearby kind of torn whether to go here or here or or is it completely elsewhere okay not too bad i guess here we have ariguzu there wasn't even a lake there was a river but either way didn't find it unfortunately but for russia definitely could have been a worse score 20 almost 2400 i'll take it i'll take it from the first glance this feels kind of norwegian these fjords what i'm assuming i think this would be norway very interesting looking from above a small town what do we have we have kind of grayish roofs this definitely feels like it could be scandinavian looking from above the shadows are going to the north so that would work as well so i have a pretty strong feeling this would be norway driving on the right side let's have a look from the street view we have yeah very much looking like norway for sure do we have any place names viking nordhordal we don't see anything that would help us much from the street view so let's go back to the satellite one so what we are looking for are fjords with a town a city kind of at the south south of one of the islands so [Music] let's try to find it wait how how let's have a look at the trees quickly how large are the trees the trees are decently sized so i don't think it would be very northern and these bridges might help as well to pinpoint it oh i think we found it i think we have it yeah what really helped are these these islands these very stretched out looking islands i was looking for those and then it just very matches this area very well and the roads also fit right here i i would say yeah yeah yeah okay nice so so which road is it okay i think okay we have this this area here i think we are on this intersection then this three-way intersection right in the middle here okay nice two meters let's go 5k i'm happy about 5ks and we have some big forests here some some cities as well shadows are going to the south so we would be in the southern hemisphere what is this blue there is one huge blue building and bunch of others not so blue building this one stands out so much looks so weird i'm thinking maybe brazil i'm not sure if we're in the southern hemisphere there was another city here right which side are we driving on can we tell it's hard to tell but i think we are driving on the right side here if i had to guess i would guess maybe um brazil but let's have a look from the ground level we have double yellow lines driving on the right side here oh okay colombia colombian crosses here so okay this is columbia good to know these are also colombian poles with these stripes so we are somewhere in colombia doesn't seem too mountainous area we do have some mountains to our east according to the um satellite view we have a town to our north you don't really have any big landmarks besides some mountains to the east and two cities that we can try to find near each other okay let's let's try to find it i guess no mountains to the south or north nearby these cities seem decently said could could it be no we would see this kali city then if it was here oh it's not there those are not the ones now this is too mountainous it's not gonna be here i'm not sure i'm thinking maybe this area there like there are some similar cities there but risky guess but i guess let's risk it for the biscuit why not okay it wasn't there it was another part of colombia i think i was looking here even did we have a river like this i guess we did have a river but it looked so small i thought that river would be smaller 20.7 000 points in the first game not too bad not too bad but hopefully we can do better i hope if you're playing along let me know in the comments how you are doing in these games i always like to read your comments this looks like a really big city here well we are not in the city our our our plonk but we do have a big city here with shadows going to the north i think i'm thinking europe driving in the right side here which european country could this be i'm not sure i was thinking like hungary somewhere in that area one of those countries we have like a water reservoir here northeast of the city we have a river very wiggly river going through as well pretty fancy looking stadium here with football fields i'm not sure where they have this wiggly river going through the city it's not budapest i know that much so so probably not hungary not sure scorpio does copy have a wiggly river no okay let's have a look from the ground level what do we see not much not much at all okay this doesn't help unfortunately uh romania maybe could this be romania you don't usually see generation 2 camera in romania but it is possible very dirty looking wherever this is you should clean up is this romania what else could it be if not romania oh oh yeah wiggly river wiggler it is bucharest they are near bucharest this wiggly wiggly river so we are north east of bucharest how do we pinpoint this we have this road going like that i think it's this road yeah yeah i think we're somewhere here ish oh i think oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah here we have this um bridge so i think we are right here on this intersection i think nice great start oh lord what is this now after a great start we get this something very rural oh my gosh okay we are coastal um canada northern canada maybe something somewhere very rural but we have an airport here someone in the comments said that in us they would only have six not zero six so this isn't us i'm not sure if they use zero six or six in canada maybe someone can let me know in the comments the shadows are going to the north yeah as i suspected would this be norway maybe northern norway i'm thinking i'm currently thinking either canada or norway let's have a look from the street view let's verify our suspicions norway okay it is norway then with these bollards black and yellow chevrons and just just these kind of very long yellow lines in the middle very norwegian this time it is very northern though because as you can see we have very small trees kind of frail looking trees so let's try to pinpoint it what could we use here to pinpoint though previous norway i liked better for pinpointing purposes looks like we are very close to to to the the very north i guess we can maybe use the airport we did have an airport nearby i'm assuming we might need to zoom in a lot for for google or to show us an airport i think it is here i think it is here this kind of island i was looking for this island because it felt the easiest to find out of all of this so i think this works we have this smaller island here and this other one as well yeah i think this would be here this is the very very edge of norway almost right next to russia so we are right here we have like a big turn uh oh here is the airport yeah here is the big turn right on this intersection here right there let's go great start i'm liking this uh next let's zoom out what do we have this time again kind of norwegian feeling no is this norway again is this norway again a lot of these small islands and everything the shadows are going north houses i could see how these houses being uh norwegian it looks like we have white central lines though looking from above huh could this be sweden then i know sweden has a lot of lot also a lot of these tiny tiny islands fun fact sweden is the most islands in the world because of all of these let's have a look from the from the ground let's verify the suspicions is it or is it not oh it is finland then huh these these road lines are very finnish these solid white lines on both sides the trees are quite tall i don't think it would be too far north we have hapa meki and ro vessi provesi hapa meki we can maybe try to find those let's let's try to find the rover see hapameki near an area with a lot of these these waters and islands hop see oh my god hapa makey almost immediately thought where's rovesi though hapa makey i mean maybe there are multiple hapa makeys that's that's always good good at that take that into account nearby we have la kolke and salman taka la kolke and salman taka i don't see those i can't find those cities is this the wrong hapa makey i'm worried i could try to align these these waters but it doesn't really seem to fit either so i'm i'm kind of scared that this might be the wrong one okay i'll i'll i'll try to find find another hapa maki what was it the other hapameki in raw vessi because i don't see raw vessey near but nearby either so let's let's let's let's keep looking grovesy hapameki then oh my lord why do they have two hapa makeys in finland it's so confusing let's compare it to the the above now compared to above oh yeah yeah this fits much better doesn't it yeah we have this island here so we are near this north of this this intersection here i believe right with one minute remaining oh this i was starting to think that i'm not gonna find it okay nine meters still five thousand points let's go oh lord what is this now this looks something very rural again something mountainous something rural what what country is this there are no houses at all there is a small road that we are on the road looks pretty good quality actually shadows seem to be going north are we driving the left side though what's driving the left side oh oh my it looks so trippy these these 3d mountains coming into your face with some pretty high mountains it seems driving the left shadows going to the north of mountains like these let's have a look from the ground level because i'm not sure oh is this this is uk huh i was considering it but it seemed too dry from above but i guess it is uk so we are in the uk somewhere reduce speed now reduce speed now would this be somewhere in scotland scotland has high mountains and then the landscape like these these kind of water water rivers everywhere locks as they call them would fit with scotland quite well somewhere here ish let's let's try to find it to align it maybe oh how do we do this wait is it here it actually is okay i thought i was gonna struggle and i immediately find it okay not bad not gonna complain um so we are somewhere on this why is there a road here did we have a road there somewhere yes we do okay hard to see from the satellite view i guess that's that's the road really difficult to see so we are basically driving right across the river there so we're here nice let's go can we get the last perfect score let's zoom out where are we where are we oh this looks quite rural again oh i don't okay we have okay we have water that's good water helps to find things that's good let's zoom in on the city what do we have a lot of grey houses gray roofs hmm really looks like really nice houses here which side are we driving on here cars are going everywhere are we driving the left side here no all right which side are we driving on i think we're driving the right side i'm getting kind of european vibes the more i look at this the more i'm feeling europe here with these houses the the the streets going everywhere i feel like in the u in u.s there would be more like more like a grid which european country would i guess switzerland belgium france somewhere there maybe one of those let's have a look from the ground level it is we're driving the left side okay i guess we're in the uk again that's why i was struggling to tell which side we were driving on apparently we are driving on the left side okay okay so we are in the uk again very pretty looking church um feeling scotland again to be honest i am feeling scotland again new one-way system so we are next to a river some hills little hills now this looks like it will be difficult to find because there oh but we oh we did have water we did have water i forgot about that though so let's see maybe some south somewhere here with water does that work it might i think it is i think it is no i i really thought this would be difficult without the this water it would be a nightmare to find but let's see if it works we do have a bridge we do have a bridge this um is it here ivy do we have a bus stop who do we do did we have bus stops here i don't see bus stops hmm okay let's let's let's align it a bit more it has to be yeah with this this this street divides into two here yeah i'm pretty sure it has to be there everything seems to match pretty perfectly even though we didn't see the bus stops but but i would go there let's go a perfect game i feel like we got lucky with these locations but let me know how you did in these challenges on the right side there will be another video i think you will enjoy and huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/6C86kUQ0LynZe2yb",

usually don't see in geoguesser and if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button and here we go the map is called unexplored world and it has 105 countries the playlong links as always will be in the description make sure to play the video play the games before watching this video and you can play along with the free account as well in case you didn't know so here we go well the the coverage of course will be unofficial because that's the whole point of the map we have a flag here that i noticed is that an indonesian but indonesia wouldn't wouldn't have been covered he covered here right so what would it be we're driving the left side thurston street english driving the left side well that might be like an indonesian embassy maybe because i'm thinking like oceania one of the oceanian um islands the indonesian embassy would make sense right rice's center okay harcourts quite hilly little seems quite mountainous could this be something no new caledonia drives on the right side i think solomon islands maybe could could could that be it hmm which side do they drive on in solomon islands i i don't know usually you can zoom in on some roundabouts to tell but but there are no roundabouts here so that's not good i guess it'll go solomon islands because i mean maybe might be something one of one of the other islands it was fiji i was i was glancing my mouse over fiji thinking maybe it's fiji it actually was it actually was fiji i had kind of the right right thought process but the distance is just so large that i got very low points there but okay next what do we have we have some holy poles very interesting looking holy poles with kind of kind of these these trapezes is that the word in english we have yellow front plate on this car that one looks to have white front plate then left side huh what would this be okay it looks like most most cars have white back plates well i'm thinking this should be africa right but driving on the left side it would be like like this part of africa right because in the northern part of africa they drive on the right side we're doing the left side here this be zombie yeah i don't know the license look like colors in these countries at all so basically you gotta go to choose it randomly i don't think it would be rwanda or burundi i don't think what does this say re-channels installation oh just it doesn't say the country there i don't think malawi maybe i kind of like malawi guess let's go malawi it was zimbabwe okay okay i guess zombia would have been a little closer there but at least we got some points here better than the first round there okay so the author here is ross corthorn driving the right side ross good old ross pretty hilly hilly country people have dark skin color here that we notice we have tuk-tuks we have these uh white and black curbs on this on the road these tuk-tuks i'm not sure we have we have some palm trees as well mountains like these where would we get mountains like these i'm actually not sure which which church parts i'm thinking it would be africa but ethiopia maybe i think ethiopia might get a bit hilly here and there south sudan i think in ethiopians also then they already drive on the right side i don't think it would be as mountainous on the london west side of africa i guess we'll see soon enough we couldn't see any language could we i didn't see any well i guess i was wrong i guess it can get quite hilly is it actually okay oh yeah it is quite hilly here very interesting it's like this this like peninsula is very hilly and then boom very flat immediately okay next we have uh okay wait vietnam the description of the map did mention that uh it has locations of countries with no coverage and limited coverage i mean vietnam does have very limited coverage so okay i guess vietnam is also in this map so the language is definitely vietnamese duong is dwong by any chance a city maybe i don't know duong i guess let's let's have a look in vietnam can we maybe find duong i mean we have we have a little bit of time so why why not hide wong i don't know if that's the same but i mean we have wong here hide wong maybe i mean that's that's as good of a guess as any right let's let's make a guess let's see oh okay it was in da nang not sure what the the duong meant maybe if someone speaks vietnamese let me know in the comments what what does that mean we have some spanish this this car the second i saw this car my first thought was cuba but okay let's have a look around could this actually be cuba i guess why not right spanish speaking driving in the right sides with a very kind of bright car like this feels very cuban to me yellow central lines here i think cuba probably would have yellow central lines and we have taberna cafeteria the poles are kind of kind of this triangular poles kind of reminding a little bit of kind of chilean poles in a way i'm not sure okay and we have another kind of very colorful this this type of car here which which kind of make would make me kind of think cuba even more so i think cuba is our best bet if it isn't cuba surely it is somewhere in this area even if it is in cuba let's go havana the capital city maybe a little bit kind of more outskirts somewhere here ish okay nice good guess good guess it was outskirts just just the other other side of the city it's all almost almost 11 000 but let's let's hope the next game can be better hopefully again link in the description of course and uh okay oh this looks my first thought was belarus maybe but okay let's have a look i think in bella russian they did use this eye letter i know they use it in ukrainian there is even the bella russian uh license plate i think i think it says b and y they're for standing for belarus i don't think it's minsk doesn't look like minsk so probably some some smaller city somewhere in belarus k h i x i don't think these these letters on the plate stand for a city i don't think maybe let's go some something like in between these like minsk and bob ruizk okay was it was quite southern very close to ukrainian border there in uh stalin next we have causing is the author kozin okay we have some some language very curly kind of round letters i know you can get kind of a very curly letters in uh sri lanka could this be india by any chance maybe we have black license plates here wait a minute myanmar oh it's i think it says myanmar here yeah okay i i was thinking could it be myanmar but i wasn't sure does myanmar uses this this kind of very circular letters but i think it says myanmar here on this sign i didn't know myanmar has black license plates that kind of threw me off there for a second okay let's go let's go let's go again maybe near the capital maybe a bit more south okay not bad even more a little bit more south than i thought but okay okay not bad good start good second round avenida avenda is talatana a city maybe commercial we have this this gonna see with the accent which they don't have in spanish so it could be portuguese maybe uh we have these brazilian style poles we have a red flag red and some black with trinidad then tobago what language do they speak which side do they drive in trinidad and tobago wait which side are we driving here we're driving the right side here yeah do they speak portuguese in trinidad and tobago i actually don't know let's let's see quickly port of spain is was the capital so probably not portuguese probably not portuguese then where else do they speak portuguese i i i wish i knew we have a red flag i don't i'll keep it here because i think it is in this area but okay i was wrong angle right i knew angola speaks portuguese but uh the pole looked so similar to brazilian when those triangular poles with those those stripes in the middle so i thought surely somewhere near brazil oh yeah yeah yeah not a good round for me not the good drone for me okay here we're driving the left side that's the first thing to notice it feels very like islandy feels like an island nation right to me at least our customers get free wi-fi extenders cool cool caribbean development bank we have here okay good good to read the author's name where do they get free wi-fi extenders does everyone know that so this is caribbean driving the left side could be any of those countries really but we're driving the left side so what could it be dominica does dominica drive on the left side we do do we have some hills i'm not sure i think we can see the ocean there maybe to our south dominican might be too hilly martinique no martinique wouldn't use english i don't think somewhere here like saint lucia saint lucia where which said are they driving on we're running out of time quickly okay ah it was okay it was barbados okay not too bad not too bad actually even though i chose the wrong island it could have been way worse next what do we have we are driving on the left wait oh on the right side with some sort of a camera on the front feels very middle eastern we have some arabic here no fishing i'm thinking it's this probably this is probably one of the smaller ones like like bahrain qatar or kuwait because that i'm definitely getting those vibes like like this area expensive looking houses all around let's go qatar maybe i feel like bahrain we would probably see more skyscrapers since we would be more in the center i think we might be kind of in the outskirts of odoha somewhere here so let's have a look is it doha yeah it was bahrain oh that was wrong my thought my thoughts were wrong 16 almost 17 000 definitely better than the first game let's go for the third time third time's the charm hopefully we can well i can get the biggest better score if you play along let me know in the comments how you are doing if you manage to beat my scores or not i always like to read your comments seguros de angola we might be in angola but of course cars travel we might be somewhere else possibly but we are driving the right side here in angola i think they do drive on the right side i think i think namibia was driving the left side and i think angola was driving on the right yes angola is driving the right side we have some uh big mountains here angola is so big i think i'll go somewhere here-ish i don't know if it is that coastal or not but but but let's go somewhere near these mountains maybe ah it was a bit more inland but still i'm happy with my guess could have been way way worse for such a big country next we're driving the right side here we have some american flags here and symbols well but this wouldn't be the u.s i don't think u.s is in this car this map plaza hogar c-c-p-a dot e-d-u dot p something para could this be paraguay i think it says p y maybe there paraguay paraguay i wouldn't actually wouldn't have been my first guest here but um number five movie movie ismo villa city in paraguay by any chance i don't know if mobile stands for a city or not i think i have to go with paraguay because of uh because of that it was paraguay nice i'm so happy that i noticed the domain name there it was very very tricky there very small here we are driving the left side feels very much like an island immediately the author's name is cw so that doesn't help me at all this time i mean let's set all all roadlines are white kind of getting uh oceania vibes this time any oceania vibes something like eg maybe or or i don't know it does seem like we might have some mountains i think fiji was quite mountainous right if those are those might be clouds i might be imagining things but if those are mountains they are to our north i mean i think there has to be a mountain right so it would work with fiji mountains to the north maybe i i hope yeah i don't see any other clues here let's just go for it well well it was trinidad and tobago this time this time it was treated and tobago huh well i was very wrong this time zero points that hurts that hurts i was thinking that surely it's oceania at least like it was very off the other here is john grennen john grenon this is john grennen apparently casino golden key los saca i can't read anything here that's so annoying we're driving the right side uh the plates are seem to be pretty wide a lot a lot of blurs i guess to protect privacy we have some people with dark skin here so maybe maybe africa i don't know is osaka a city or lusaka since we're doing the right side uh maybe somewhere like like like like cote d'ivoire lu i knew i've heard of lusaka where are we driving the right side there oh my lord we are driving the left side i saw this car on this side and i thought it meant that we we would be driving the right side here i totally missed that these cars are driving on the left side there and we even have the city name oh i'm so angry that's what i get for not knowing capital cities of the world i should really learn them this feels very much like middle east now the author is mahmoud al-hashem hashem sorry for mispronouncing the name yeah this feels very much like middle east again looks like a pretty well-off country some nice buildings some yachts some some you know some some big big apartment buildings here could it be uh qatar this time or is it gonna be bahrain again or something else maybe maybe kuwait this time should we go bahrain again i know i don't know the houses did look very similar in bahrain didn't they okay let's go with bahrain let's go with the bahrain like block 257 i think that was the one we had last time let's let's go there let's go let's go okay and let's do the summary 14 000. okay didn't do as well as i hoped for but we had some very good rounds in this game if you played along let me know how you did in these challenges and on the right side there will be another play along video for you to enjoy huge thanks all the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind

playing it looking from above the map that we're going to be playing is a complete world you can play it regularly as well but if you want to play it looking from above like i will be doing i will leave an info card up there where you can follow the instructions and set it up yourself as well if you want to play along the links as always will be in the description just make sure to play it before watching this video so don't spoil anything so here we go oh okay oh my god this is difficult i'm expecting this map is going to be super hard because it contains a bunch of rural locations which which might not be the best from looking from above but we'll i'll i'll do my best i'll do my best we'll see how that goes um the quality is just terrible like i couldn't tell what's the road lines what are the road lines or which side we are driving on here we have a small city here small town with some blue roofs blue roofs the shadows are going i think slightly to the north so we should be in the northern hemisphere um whenever i see blue roofs i'm thinking asia but could this be asia i'm kind of torn between asia and africa right now uh we have a big mountain here big mountain with like like uh some agricultural land on the left side agricultural land on the right side what is this is this like an airport being built maybe can i find which side we are driving on the roads do not look paved this is super rural very rural and again this could be anywhere in the world even countries without official coverage anywhere i think i'm leaning more towards africa here but i could easily see this being asia or maybe even somewhere in america as possibly this is a very very red soil that i'm noticing i probably should have noticed it earlier but yeah there is a very red soil maybe this could be cambodia i know in cambodia you get red soil although in africa you can also in many countries you can also get very red soil so it's not like it helps me in cambodia you don't get many mountains but there is this kind of like a mountain range here i don't think it'll it would align here so i don't think it would be there could this be something like myanmar maybe there is like there are some mountains here maybe these would be those there are a bunch of small towns here and there i i'm kind of liking this area because there are vertical mountains here there are a bunch of small towns around i would expect some of those houses to have blue roofs so i i think that would be my best guess there really isn't anything that i can try to find or look for so it was india oh it was asia it was asia not where i guess though but but you know i don't know how i could have could have found it if you manage to find it let me know in the comments how but let's move on to the next one oh this also looks so difficult oh my god this is gonna be a rough game isn't it we have okay we have a road and we have a bigger road this time can i tell which side we are driving on here that already would be huge the quality again is not the best there is some sort of a water reservoir here like a smallish lake with these kind of kind of red and white or black and white i can't really tell curbs on the sides you see that a lot in like like um middle eastern countries like israel maybe or or jordan somewhere in that area could be lebanon possibly so i'm thinking somewhere there it also looks quite arid a little bit mountainous so i'm thinking maybe kind of that there is some greenery as well so i'm thinking maybe kind of northern israel somewhere there possibly but but let's let's explore a little bit more oh a lot of blue roofs here again what's with blue roofs today okay we are driving in the right side yeah okay this car you can see the the front windshield there uh clearly so yeah we are driving the right side i think the best identifying factor here would be this lake i can try to find it but but i'm not having any high hopes here but let's try let's try there are a couple of kind of similar lakes uh in in syria so i'm thinking maybe this could be southern syria it looks good looks to be quite mountainous as well so i think currently my best guess would be somewhere around here there is like a semi-large city um to our south and kind of medium medium-sized city so could be any of these if it isn't if it even is in this area i i can't find a lake that would match perfectly so i'm kind of scared that it might be somewhere completely else this is a tricky location i have to say i i did find some similar lakes in like iran maybe pakistan but i think i will still go somewhere like syria because i think that's the best bet and then i i i hope it is there i was it was a oh it was a rock oh wait what i didn't see this lake well in big maps we do have some like a like some sort of a reservoir on the left side on google maps well you i guess you can see it barely but it is not visible in the map view so i was basically searching for something that didn't exist lovely and we couldn't see this like i don't think so that was um futile but okay at least it wasn't too bad i was kind of in the right area so the score is okay oh what is with these rounds we're getting literally middle of nowhere all the time oh my lord i have to rely on my tree knowledge from above trees and mountains uh i hope we get some cities as well i hope it's not all like this we have shadows going to the north so again we should be in the northern hemisphere here very small small village it seems uh the houses are uh spread far apart from each other unpaved roads very hilly and foresty we have a river wait is that a bigger city maybe down here that is a little bit of a bigger city here i'm thinking somewhere in america's maybe could this be northern brazil can we see the the cars the roads maybe you know we have a couple of small villages here i can't tell which side we're driving on i can't see any road lines on the few paved roads that we have we do have some pretty high mountains here as you can maybe tell by this kind of kind of looks three-dimensional there yeah no no not many clues but from what i have i'm thinking maybe somewhere uh like northern brazil maybe something like venice whale i don't think venezuela is this mountainous though is it maybe in some parts but but maybe something like central america like guatemala honduras maybe i'm not sure how their roofs look from above but i could see it being somewhere there we have a river we have a river going here which seems like a decently sized river without knowing which country it is it's it's pretty much impossible to find what what this river would be i i think i'll go closer to central america i think i will go something like costa rica maybe we do have some sort of a river going here it doesn't really match perfectly but that's as as good as i will find i think yeah i think i'll just just guess with five minutes remaining because there's no chance i'm finding that river so might as well base my guess on my initial god feeling so let's get somewhere like honduras somewhere in this area oh my lord it's literally on the other side of the world on this one oh the houses didn't feel asian this time to me oh i have to say well it was laws northern laws huh i didn't think it was that mountainous there i mean you can see some hills but it felt more mountainous but either way i would not have guessed in laws there you all have a great chance of beating my score on this one let me know in the comments how you are doing if you play along okay this is a bigger city finally thank god a bigger city uh maybe we can find some clue actual clues this time we have a river we have an airport here zero three zero three runway zero three one runway okay so i guess that's the quality that we get here huh it kind of looks like we're driving the left side now i i think we are yeah i think we are driving the left side okay okay so where are the shadows going the shadows are going north so we are in the northern hemisphere driving on the left side okay so it kind of eliminates most of american countries would this be asia again we do have some blue roofs here again if this is asia this is a pretty large and developed city pretty pretty nice looking city from above could this be africa but in northern hemisphere most countries drive on the right side in africa would this ever be uk i don't see this being uk doesn't really feel like it um yeah this is definitely the uk has more narrow houses narrow very close to each other generally and the roofs aren't as colorful we have a small like a water reservoir there a lot of parks here we have a stadium without any texts so that doesn't help us oh a bunch of smaller stadiums and tennis courts so a sporty nation this looks like maybe look like a like a lake as well and another football field another sports field a lot of sports fields here so i don't know what to think of it does that help probably not because of all of these blue roofs i i'm thinking um asia again i am thinking asia again a lot of cars though in asia you often see a lot of like bikes and tuk-tuks and such i don't think we see much of them here although maybe these are it's hard to tell quality isn't as good maybe those are tuk-tuks this is a very interesting one if i had to guess right now i would maybe guess something like thailand maybe but i'm very much not sure here quality isn't as good down here but we have more sports fields a lot more houses very densely populated maybe india i could see this being india maybe i think i like india guess but which city would we guess here we have a pretty nice like a forest the forest the mountain to our north west of the city and then the city itself has a river going through i think we can try to find it we have an airport we have a looks like a pretty big city and like a mountain to our north west let let's let's explore some some of the biggest indian cities it's crazy how large india is so either i overlooked it or it isn't in india i checked out bangalore there shortly as well uh let's i don't know let's let's block it kind of somewhere in the middle of india it might be somewhere it might be thailand it might be some some different country as well of course but it was actually thailand ah wow oh okay it was a small it was a smaller place than i thought the city doesn't look as large from above i would not have checked it yeah it aligns with their airport and the river but i just wouldn't have checked it even if i was looking over thailand some oh my god i hope i can get at least one perfect score in this game that would be nice we have uh we have something here we have like a bigger looking kind of lakey thing and we have a city in the top left corner very red roof that i see and where are we driving which side on the right side i think yeah so driving on the right side with these very red roofs some of the houses maybe feel a bit european some don't these these houses don't feel european at all so i don't think this is europe where is the sun going where where are the shadows going the shadows i can't really tell where are the shadows going do we have any clouds you can sometimes tell the shadows by the clouds the shadows are a little bit a little bit to the south but but it's basically around we're around equatorial line i think somewhere close-ish equatorial land with roofs like this i can't really put my finger on it where where would this be i'm thinking maybe mexico could it be mexico i'm just getting american vibes i'm not entirely sure why but uh maybe the rules i could see these these roofs being from from america's somewhere either mexico or another country nearby so if it is close i guess southern mexico would fit with the sun or maybe it's something like panama so we did have some some lakey things right we have these these lakes on the right side oftentimes these lakes don't look exactly the same in google maps that's what concerns me if i try to find it it might look might be looking completely different in google maps it might be completely futile to try to find it what is this smaller town here maybe we can get something out of this oh are these palm trees those i'm not sure maybe like a palm tree plantation would these be oiled palms i don't know doesn't look they don't look like all palms to me from i don't know it would be something like this something that's not it though kind of kind of similar vibes is it hilly was it hilly here a little bit but not very it appears we might have some hills here and there but it isn't very hilly would it be somewhere southern southern mexico actually could it be we have a smaller town here we have a bigger town more to the north the river doesn't align yeah it's it's not here but it's kind of similar so maybe it's nearby kind of like in colombia because it would fit in terms of sun position it would fit with kind of a little bit hilly in some places here and it's also kind of in the middle of all of these countries which i'm considering what if it isn't america's what if what if i'm in the wrong part of the world again that would be bad oh this might be one of my worst satellite view games ever but honestly this is such a difficult map so i don't even feel that bad for having a bad score i i think i i have to go here let's see let's just see and hope and oh my god oh my lord okay it was it was the rock it was the opposite side of the world again it and yeah as i mentioned the water isn't even on the screen here it looks completely different in the map so zero chance i would have ever found it let's do the summary six almost 6800 points on this game let's hope let's hope my second game goes better hopefully i can get at least um at least one perfect score that's all i want one perfect score uh we'll see we'll see this is an island a small island oh we have a bunch of solar panels it seems and how are those solar panels no they are not agricultural fields maybe very dark though hmm and where are these stripes are those for fishing some fishing nets maybe not sure very interesting looking i have to say there are some mountains here which said are we driving on i was thinking could this be like like a japanese island possibly can we tell which side we are driving on that could be very helpful here the sun is the shadows are a little bit to the north so that would indicate northern hemisphere if we're drawing the right side it kind of throws me for a loop so to speak we are driving on the right side where are we then i thought japan i thought this was japan um this definitely feels asian to me it has to be asian with again blue roofs doors driving the right side small island could this be one of the taiwanese islands maybe they have a bunch of islands around and they do drive on the right side let's explore this city here it has to be like some for for oh maybe they're for like like raising some fishes or something those sections i have no idea if anyone knows let me know in the comments i'm really interested to know what those those squares are for i think yeah let's let's explore some of the islands at the coast of taiwan hope for the best maybe could this be philippines maybe maybe but but this doesn't really fit no it was kind of kind of like a sharp sharply shaped but doesn't really fit but like there definitely are some similarities i think in terms of how how how it all looks but again this could be anywhere it doesn't have to be a country with official coverage so maybe it's like a chinese maybe those are some chinese islands it's also a possibility i could maybe see it being south korea as well because there are a couple of like similar shaped uh non-style islands but but but yeah what is wait what is this wait is it oh my i had given up honestly oh my god okay i think i think this is actually it okay we have oh my god we have 30 seconds remaining so we are oh my lord uh so so so we are on on the road like somewhere here we are on a road oh my god how am i gonna pinpoint this uh we have like oh my god so here this we have this thing okay we should be here we should be here okay one perfect score is done i had given up i was looking at south korea before i could i didn't see this island somehow when talking to you i somehow found it let's go oh my god okay one perfect score one perfect score okay ooh this looks like a very big city very big city so uh i hope i can find it but okay look look almost like an island the quality isn't the best though oh we have oh we have watered our south which would make me think uh maybe kind of western africa maybe because i know sometimes the quality in this area isn't the best um but those cities are still huge huge and they also look kind of similar to this with kind of water going in inland like this so i would think i don't know which country though let's let's explore yeah the quality doesn't get a better as we zoom in unfortunately um i i'm i would definitely go africa here from the first glance and with the water to our south we have an airport here we have an airport on the very coast and a lot of lot of a lot of smaller houses here this is a huge city so would this be lagos would this be lagos maybe i could see it being lagos maybe but it isn't it isn't lagos lagos looks different um what is this we're looking for like some like a water kind of canal going going like that got it diagonally so wherever this is there should be a canal visible akra akra doesn't fit somewhere here oh we oh we do have a canal here yeah yeah this is it this is it abby john wait where is abby john which country cote d'ivoire occur divorce so this is cote d'ivoire apparently abby john i hope i pronounce it correctly we do have an airport yeah on the coast this island also alliance here so yeah we are definitely there this was a kind of an easy around thank god because all the previous ones were such such a such a nightmare so we are in between this thingy and this small lake right here i would say nice four meters great guess and we're back to the middle of nowhere back to the middle of nowhere let's go good things can't last forever we have a paved road shadows are going to the south um i'm thinking botswana first first thought kind of very sandy looking pretty bright uh light uh sand color mostly so maybe botswana but this could really be almost anywhere i don't even know where to start here maybe we can find some cars on the road to see which side we are driving on those trees almost look like they're growing on the road very close well i haven't seen a single car on this road just some trees so i'm thinking yeah with shadows going to our south roads like uh like this pretty red soil at some places though you can get kind of reddish soil in botswana as well i remember from the video from one of my recent videos where where i made a map for zigzag and there was a very red botswana location there i would go botswana here with a road like that um not sure about those rivers there i was thinking somewhere here but are there any rivers nearby there are some small rivers so i'm not sure if they align might not be here it might not even be botswana i mean maybe there are more rivers yeah more towards the northern side of the country yeah there definitely are more rivers like that we have a road the road goes from the north to the south east and the river the river also very similarly maybe this could be south africa i could see that could this be the bibia or the river is like that in namibia no idea i'm assuming maybe somewhere there is one river here which kind of the direction would a line is there a road going along the river there kind of is i think this is our best bet right now wait can we find can we find this road no the river ends so that's not a very long river apparently huh i thought it was looking so well actually that the direction alignment i think i i'll still guess there i think because because it just alliance so well well even if we had seen the cars uh namibi also drives on the left side so it wouldn't have helped yeah it wasn't really considering australia there yeah yeah of course it aligns very well it aligns next round round number four okay coastal a lot of agricultural fields okay let's have a lot of whoa oh very many blue roofs and dark blue roofs as well every every square inch is used i am thinking kind of like an island nation maybe where are the shadows going first of all that's that's a very helpful clue always the shadows appear to be going a little bit to the north here so we should be in the northern hemisphere can we see which side we are driving on if we can trust this um road uh collar like this top line it appears that we would be driving the left side here driving on the left side northern hemisphere i was thinking maybe somewhere caribbean but but driving in the left side i know some of these countries do drive on the left side i don't know which ones though i know some dude i know some drive on the right side some drive on the left side but with which ones are which no clue so let's just have a look at them maybe something pops in the eyes so we're looking for like a coastal city with um sea to the north west and some sort of like a like a water reservoir here maybe we can see that as well this might be very very zoomed in so we really need to check out these these islands very carefully not to miss it i'm starting to think what if this is asia coastal asia or maybe an island somewhere there as well caribbean islands don't really fit that well so let's check out age maybe have a look there those dark blue roofs are kind of throwing me off because there are a lot of them there are a lot of dark blue roofs so i'm not sure what to think of it i think i'll maybe leave it in southern thailand but well i still have two minutes i can still try to find it but uh not having high hopes i can't decide whether i should go caribbean or asia oh let's go asia let's go asia let's go so where we're trying on the left side let's go thailand maybe could this ever be like malaysia indonesia oh japan [Applause] japan makes sense yeah yeah japan makes sense but but didn't really cross my mind those those roofs for some reason well i guess now i will know so many dark rooms are japanese apparently didn't know that before and we are ending on another wonderful rural location we have a road can we see the road lines no we cannot do we have any cars on this road seeing which side we are driving on not really oh no wait there is there is a car we are doing the right side it would seem okay well my thought was brazil could this be brazil could this be brazil i think it could be the shadows are a little bit to the south i think so that checks out we have a lot of forests we have some some red soil here as well which you can see in brazil as you know what are these things here huh oh i guess they're being like like the trees are being cut down for like wood in these spots and then regrown maybe and we do have some mountains to our west do we see any water tanks in brazil you often see some water tanks next to buildings can't see a single water tank but i mean that doesn't doesn't mean that it couldn't still couldn't be brazil these these kind of small town squares i feel you see them a lot in south america being brazil is my best bet could this be something like paraguay we have we have a river going with with a lot of a lot of small curves can i try to find it i guess that's my best bet but that's a long shot so we have this river we have mountain range here well let's try let's try maybe it could be somewhere here ish i mean the river is a little similar and also i was thinking the the mountain range to our west like that i mean maybe maybe it's somewhere this this this one maybe this that's this mountain range we have like a look a river almost takes like a 90 degree turn here can we find something like that i don't i don't think it would be that more much more south than that because i think it looks different there i i think i will just go here and i don't know where else oh maybe it could be here for somehow overlooked ecuadorian and colombian mountain range there are a couple of rivers there as well now would this be now do i think this would be more argentina or or colombia or ecuador i don't know i don't know i'm more inclined maybe to go somewhere up here and hope for the best okay let's go let's go oh my first guess my initial guess was much closer it turned out to be believey yeah is that was that the river that i was looking for it looks nothing like that like like what i was searching for i don't see that 90 turn uh 90 degree angle anywhere the mountains i guess there are some mountains but i thought they were looking for some taller ones this map is difficult from above let me know in the comments how you did in these games hopefully you managed to beat me and on the right side there will be another play along satellite view video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "image_not_available": [1],

mural world which contains interesting and beautiful murals around the world if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button subscribe and here we go there can be both official and unofficial coverage in this map so i'm excited about that let's set the time limit to minute and a half and no moving and let's go challenge links is always in the description but play it before watching this video so don't spoil the locations here is the first mural really cool oh wow you can even see the fish fishing wire going across all the buildings that's at first i thought this was a fishing wire too but no that's just the regular wire okay that's a that's a really cool one so it might be a coastal city maybe with like fishing and stuff so let's have a look what um what what country do we have we have they this sign looks quite spanish so i'm going to think in spain right now do we see anything uh oh oh i totally missed this pedestrian crossing sign in spain you will get these pedestrian crossing sands with eight stripes on on them so this this kind of verifies that we would be in spain i don't see the coast but i think we would be near a coast with this mural i bet it is like it says on this this trash bin the city name did it like the council but uh yeah can't read it can't read it there we're running out of time oh my dear lord oh let's block it somewhere here oh okay even more south oh i was thinking somewhere like near valencia or something but what was super super south was estepona never heard of it before this is cool this is salvador dali right i recognize his big mustache a very cool very very colorful i i don't think i recognize the other people i'm sorry if uh if i should what do we have here this pole this pole um seems maybe like uh puerto rico could it could it be do we see any antenna on the google car we don't we don't i know you can like see similar polls in like dominican republic and puerto rico download mobile so we have english we have english maybe this is just like florida or something quite southern u.s maybe tony doesn't help i'm thinking florida right now we're again running out of time plenty of other cool looking murals here so very artistic very artistic looking place wherever this is did we have front plates i didn't didn't pay attention do we have front plates hard to see actually but i would go florida orlando maybe or jacksonville oh okay it was just miami was very even more south than i thought i thought orlando would be good for hedging kind of in the middle of florida but i am happy with this guess very happy let's go for the next round where do we go another colorful kind of similar to the previous one in terms of the style this is not florida this time i can tell we have some spanish on the signs um this would be somewhere in south america right so san paolo okay is it portuguese on the signs maybe it's portuguese i thought it was spanish but but what do i know i can never tell them both apart um is portuguese i know rua is portuguese so yeah we are in uh brazil then are we in sao paulo maybe if it says san paulo i'm gonna go san paolo simple as that and it was saint paulo let's go let's go five kilo kilometers away pretty good score but that was an easy round admittedly probably most people would go san paolo there the legendary big bun i guess looks like maybe some sort of a rapper or artist never heard of them we have yellow plates here a couple of yellow plates which would make me think maybe new york we have speed limit sign which is american so we are somewhere in america a lot of yellow plates dark yellow plates which would make me think new york city probably prona or bronx okay says bronx new york bronx new york which one was bronx i'll be honest i don't know which way was where exactly was bronx in new york uh new york manhattan brooklyn the bronx here we go here is the bronx what did it say on on that sign westchester avenue westchester avenue what are the chances that we're gonna find westchester avenue i should have probably looked at the direction of the road immediately oh what it wasn't even in bronx or or is the bronx like this whole area i haven't know it let me know in the comments i have no idea where bronx ends ooh this is an interesting one what i notice is that the kid has a french black looking helmet it says paris here paris so the artist might be from the paris or this might be paris oh and then this is a nice one i really like this this uh mural i'm very quick on the kind of artsy and then flying horses and cute we have language uh fresc is the street yeah we do have blue strip on the right side which you often see on the french plate any phone numbers here who who is in france yeah south you see south in france in paris the phone numbers begin with zero one but we don't have any phone numbers here but because just because we have this paris here the text i choose to go paris this looks like a big city with big houses so so definitely could be paris let's guess maybe somewhere there and it was paris let's go let's go admittedly not two difficult locations in the first seat 22.7 thousand points i'll take it i'll take it let's play again i really like this map this map always has some very beautiful um locations to admire ah this was i should know who that is i have seen this person before i think they were singer right oh my god i should know who they are i think i don't know many famous people i always forget their names we are driving on the left side here well this is uk of course right you have yellow backplate so it wouldn't be ireland central health click bristol it says bristol here university hospital's bristol where was bristol oh that was belfast bristol where is bristol bath where is bristol birmingham where is bristol seriously bristol oh my how did i miss it university hospital uh can we can we maybe find the university hospital in time we have 20 seconds remaining there are a couple of hospitals but i don't see university hospital uh from the first glance so let's keep it kind of central and and yeah hope for the best it was oh it wasn't too far i'll take it oh this is pretty this is pretty the future history is unwritten ooh so this maybe is either a politician or or a writer maybe hate has caused a lot of problems in the world but has not solved one yet through very true dr maya angelou oh that that's that's what she is dr maya angelou i don't think i have heard of her before we have some spanish we have some spanish here and we have some english spanish and english and yeah the signs are in english so we might be kind of in southern u.s maybe cause i know they do have some spanish-speaking uh communities there we do have palm trees which also would indicate southern us running out of time quickly oh my oh my i'm thinking texas oh i didn't see if we have front plates or not oh i always forget to check it was okay it was california if you get southern us with front plates that's basically either texas or california chose the wrong one still very nice location still enjoyed it a lot oh this is unofficial coverage okay this is a beautiful one wow very very photo realistic mural a happy happy lady with some some colorful sea in the background so where would this be we have yellow back plates and we see some chinese language so oh yeah and it is it is yeah and also these street signs with both english and chinese you see them in hong kong and also the yellow back plates would fit with hong kong they do have yellow back plates white front plates and driving on the left side so we would be somewhere in hong kong uh go street and shin king street i don't think i'll be able to find any of them but i can try well i knew it was a long shot so so i didn't find it but yeah oh it was the other side here okay nice score let's go let's go what do we have here we have i don't know should i blur it out i i guess i'll blur it out i don't want to get demonetized we have a mural here with some some uh native americans i think oh and this pole this ball looks like a chilean pole here what else what else do we have oh we have another mural on the other side very nice yeah this looks like chilean taxi with this kind of black bottom yellow top red plates i would go chile does it say doesn't say the city though i was hoping it maybe says the city where it is we have some mountains to our kind of north west west northwest um i don't know i think i'll go santiago because mountains could kind of west northwest would fit okay nice nice it was a bit more south but nice guess oh wow okay this is so colorful wow oh this is cool so we are in a tunnel remember who you are spain malaysia so we are either in spain or malaysia that's that's a pretty big difference so i think we would be in spain with this yeah this also this also looks like a spanish language so i would go spain here then i don't know if this is madrid or somewhere else but this is such a cool tunnel would be cool to visit it one day so let's go let's go madrid i think it was madrid let's go what i'm noticing it's oftentimes the capital city not always though but but quite often what we have 21 300 this time not as good as the previous one the american round uh lost me a lot of points there but let's go for the third time third time's the charm again link in the description of course oh okay okay this oh this is a cool one's looking like a kid looking through like a window or something i don't know what's happening here but some some magical bats more more children looking what do we have here bottles and plastic so we have english we have english benalla queen city or something i can't really read it i don't even know which continent this is to be honest i'm thinking maybe australia or new zealand i don't know i can't see which side we are driving on here i i would go australia maybe maybe but that's a big maybe i don't know let's go sydney let's go sydney and hope for the best okay it was australia it wasn't sydney though but oh it was like a like a smaller town banal it did say banala i've never heard of banala well now i have there's no chance i would have found it though next one next one oh here is the mural that looks like an old fisherman with some some fish skeletons in the background what is that language not sure looks quite nordic i would say i think we have a yellow sun in the distance which would make me think maybe sweden yeah yeah this this is sweden with these um these yellow signs first of all the language looks swedish and also this um pedestrian crossing center with four stripes in finland you would get five oh my god there are cats and dogs here that's cute i don't think this looks like stockholm i don't think it's gonna be stockholm this time there are some hills in the distance near norway maybe but i don't think it is there i don't know i'll get somewhere here or bro let's get sorry bro kind of in the middle oh not bad it wasn't close the doorway actually ah okay i'm happy with my guess not too bad okay this is a cool one lisa king is the author of this one lady with birds holding a skull cool cool drive-through enter the rear which side are we driving on we are doing the left side yeah okay so this would be either australia or new zealand here oh which one is it though more cats and dogs but doesn't help me doesn't help me figure out where we are that's not good that's not good let's go with melbourne um let's let's let's keep it in melbourne oh what what where was it benala wait it's the same one what's with banala okay i guess in benala there are tons of different uh murals huh next time we're getting israeli i'm going with banala that's for sure oh this is that that uh leonardo da vinci man right with those many many arms but this isn't italy though this is not italy with this this plate i'm thinking either brazil or argentina we have one two one two pre like the code the area code one two oh one two which oh where was one two oh san paolo i think san paulo itself was one one and one two was somewhere nearby so maybe one two is here all you hear is da vinci itself mona lisa not sure what this museum is about but looks cool looks cool ah okay it was it was closer it's just the center of sao paulo and the last round what do we have oh this is a cool mural this is a very cool doors to another world we have some reddish plates as you can see it definitely feels like like that area where like around belgium this is a french plate as well which makes sense that you would see a french plate in belgium for example i am leaning belgium here oh my tahoma see we have some french language here as well wait we have a french flag here wait a minute maybe this is france near belgium then maybe this is a belgian belgium car in france oh i'm i'm being bamboozled here which one is it the plates i see more belgian plates i see more belgian plates but i think this is close to france because i don't see any dutch i only see french so let's go mon mon is that how you say that city name let's go somewhere there it wasn't as close to the border as i thought but it was in belgium and it was southern belgium in total 22 000 points again and a pretty steady score around 22 000 for me in these games let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges and on the right side you will find another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all patrons and youtube members for supporting

got this idea from chicago geographer i will leave a link to his video in the description if you enjoyed these satellite tv videos don't forget to press that like button and here we go if you want to play along the links as always will be in the description and if you want to use the satellite view that i will be using i will leave an info card up there on how to add it to geogaser so let's do 10 minutes as as per usual for the satellite view videos satellite view enabled and let's go kikido okay this this seems like a pretty big city here nearby we have a river a lot of red roofs so so the shadows are going north so i'm definitely thinking europe here we have a bunch of parks nearby um looking this seems like a decently sized city so i'm looking for maybe like a stadium or something here where was the the border itself so here is the border checkpoint right the border checkpoint it it does seem that the cars are being checked here so these um countries might not be both in the schengen zone maybe because if both countries are in schengen zone you can just drive drive across the border basically well i don't know all the countries who are in schengen zone though that's that's an issue and i kind of find something helpful here like a stadium or something i mean we have a stadium here but what does it say hi and ollie well it doesn't mean anything to me maybe some football fans know immediately oh the the high team is from there i don't know any high teams where could this be uh we did have a q quite a few red red roofs i was thinking maybe something like bulgaria somewhere here bulgaria serbia so the road itself is is like um kind of slightly diagonal so we can maybe try to find a road like that might not necessarily be this border between these countries but um i'm thinking somewhere in this area this road kind of looks a bit similar and that the turns turns up just like this one does okay the road goes like this and then divides in a bunch of smaller no it's not there i i get so excited there for a second it looked so promising but no no i mean i feel like it has to be somewhere in this area could it be now there's there's all a river through uh along bulgaria romania right wait a minute i was checking uh romania hungary before but it didn't go all the way through uh up could could this be it we do have a road that goes there do we have a river nearby we do we do okay i think this is actually it oh my god i was checking the romanian hungarian border but i kind of stopped like around here i was thinking oh it's probably not going to be that north oh my god i'm glad i rechecked it so there is that road there i think we should be around here ish okay nine meters good start okay next round what do we have now uh again from the first glance quite european looking kind of very similar to the previous one i would say no like the fields look very similar okay maybe the roofs are slightly different not as orange we have a bunch of gray ones as well here but it looks so similar something maybe somewhere in that area we did have a bunch of borders that have river going uh going through so could be one of those maybe let's have a look at the border itself we do have uh checkpoints but we don't don't see big big lines like we saw in the previous one i don't see many clues in this city did we have another one on the other side just like a small one i guess let's just look around the same area maybe this river oh my god this river is so twisty so we are looking for a river that uh basically with a bridge across the river i never realized that between hungary uh romanian and uh bulgarian border there basically no bridges there only like like some ferries that take you over apparently from what i can see okay here is a bridge but okay that doesn't align i oh i think this might be because we have this weird shape here that we had this would fit this would the the direction fits we have a city oh my god okay we found it oh with two minutes i was not thinking that i would find it in time to be honest but okay it was nearby it wasn't nearby but it was croatia hungary right and it is 11 meters let's go what do we have next what do we have next oh this looks like a very small river it's definitely not europe looks kind of african from the first glance which side are we driving on can we tell it looks like the trucks are standing as if they were driving on the right side here we have a very small very small river quite green looking where is the sun going can we see i'm not sure if this is africa or is this south america it looks like the shadows are going to our south so it wouldn't get southern hemisphere southern hemisphere driving on the right side i don't think it would be africa because most countries in africa that drive on the right side are in the northern hemisphere and the ones that are driving the right don't have google coverage so i i would be going probably the south america then looks quite flat again and green lat and green huh is there there is a small river which is quite curvy so but we need like a city on both sides there is a city on both sides okay so it might not be brazilian uruguay then not going to be argentina and uruguay because it's vertical and the river is too big could it be paraguay with something what is this here what oh these are some interesting borders i didn't know so this is argentina then there is paraguay water there is argentina island half of this island is paraguay this is very a very interesting border yeah could it be somewhere no no not there i don't know i feel like i've checked all the all the borders that i thought it could be could this be northern brazil maybe they checked everything down here what if it is like a border with like one of these there isn't much coverage up here though no no no none of these countries really fit i don't think what else cause because here it will be way too mountainous for these countries it would be way too dry to be here i mean it has to be somewhere in this area did i check brazil and bolivia there is a river there so let's go along there and see it was peru it was with peru oh my god it was a triple border oh wow okay that was my my bad my oversight i should have seen that since i checked this area at least i got the right continent gotta look for something positive oh no this looks so difficult there is nothing here like a super tiny road between the countries this looks like europe we do have shadows going to the north yes quite hilly kind of brownish roofs i am thinking from the first glance maybe something like slovenia somewhere in that area possibly i know there are a lot of kind of green and mountainous areas there the difficult part here is there isn't really anything to try to find because there is absolutely no chance i'm finding this tiny road between two countries without knowing what those countries are even i just know there is a big mountain tiny tiny river here and maybe there is a bigger city to our south but we can't really see the best clue i can find is is the roofs i don't think it's too too too western like like i think these mountains here would be higher than this i'm thinking somewhere in slovenia slovenia austria italy somewhere in this area which direction is the border the border is kind of almost west like from west to east and then turns up into a tiny tiny village but since this since the border is from west to east i think it is more likely to be with uh italy maybe than with austria because with austria the border would probably be from from north to south it's the same way the same with croatia so i think i think this border would be my best shout but there is absolutely no chance i'm fighting the tiny tiny road i don't think there is point of me waiting and looking for anything because i know i won't find anything so i might as well just plonk it somewhere let's just plonk it and hope okay okay so i was on the right border but but well yeah of course not not not exactly where there was this road visible kind of kind of like a 90 degree angle but i mean i guess maybe i could have found it but i'm still very happy with my guess oh wow that's green oh wow that's green okay mountainous and super green literally in the middle of a forest a bus which which could be a good clue i'm thinking somewhere again in brazil maybe maybe northern brazil this time like like somewhere in that area the quality isn't good at all where are the shadows going can we see the shadows are going slightly to the north which would fit with northern brazil because it is in the northern hemisphere slightly some blue roofs i have seen some blue roofs in asia again there isn't much to search for is there we have a road very twisty road that goes into the city can we see which side we're driving on because i'm not sure if this is brazil or asia those blue roofs are throwing me off cause i feel like i've seen a blue roof way more commonly in asia than in brazil i don't see a single driving car um i'm so torn i'm so torn here i'm i think i'm leaning more towards asia southeast asia somewhere this hilly maybe either northern or southern thailand maybe it wouldn't be cambodia with this hilly right well cambodia can have some hills but not near the border cambodian hills are like in this area thailand can be quite hilly up here or down here i feel like if it was down here then we maybe could see some water nearby because okay there are some lakes and stuff here i'm thinking what else could it be keeping in mind that uh all this coverage does have official coverage as well next time when i play satellite view i'll choose a map which could be anywhere not only official coverage because cause i know not everyone enjoys these only official coverage maps i don't even know if this is the right border this might actually be brazil i might be like like literally in the opposite side of the world at this point or could it be somewhere here indonesia malaysia but i feel i feel we would see more roads if it was here maybe if this is asia then then this part makes the most sense to me okay let's go somewhere here i i i hope we're the best ah okay so it was sort of the right border oh it was a very western thailand okay well yeah it it aligns it aligns at least this decent score could have been better but but at least i got the right country so i'm happy about that so it was asia without the blue roofs i would have 100 gone with brazil on that one how did they do in total 19 000 not too bad usually for satellite view i kind of wish for a little bit more than that but i feel like this is quite a tricky tricky map for a satellite view very interesting looking um place a lot of basically all the buildings are next to the river so it looks very very interesting from above where where's the border crossing is is the river the border maybe i guess the river would be the border right this is a big river where is the sun going i'm currently thinking maybe could this be something like uh again blue roofs asia maybe or africa maybe this time which should be driving on can we see i can't tell which side we are driving on even here there aren't many cars and when we see some some motorcycles or something i can't tell i mean i think those are motorcycles and i think motorcycles would be more common in asia it looks like we are driving the right side i think if we can trust this car but maybe it's overtaking this car i don't know where would there be such a border like this wait is this car driving the left side oh i can't tell why is this quality so bad i was thinking maybe bangladesh if we are driving in the left side could it actually be africa i just think this looks more asian than african yeah i i don't think it's africa i i think it has to be my best bet would be bangladesh india but i just i couldn't find anything that would fit this i don't know let's let's see oh it was oh i kind of glanced over here but i didn't see a river like that um i kind of assumed that the border would go along the river because often times that's the case but okay just didn't consider that okay so it was cambodia again at least i recognized the continent yay oh no this looks difficult again is this water or what is this forest oh i guess yeah that's a forest okay we have kind of red and black roofs thinking europe maybe sun is shadows are going to the north there is like a river here the border goes border is very small it seems no like big checkpoints or anything which also would work for europe it looks like at the border is going kind of here there's like a slight line it appears to be a little bit hilly i was thinking something like czechia poland in that area somewhere i think the biggest identifying unique factor is this skinner river at the top in a very big kind of curves we have so many black rooves i don't know why would they have so many black roofs in europe i think they used some black rose in belgium but but but this wouldn't be belgium no this is so difficult i thought the country borders would be easier an easier map or satellite view i imagine it might be easier from the regular street tube maybe if you can see some flags on the borders or something okay the time is up i think i'll keep it between germany and czechia because first of all it's quite central and second of all i think it might be somewhere in that area oh it was actually czech border but with austria okay uh here is that border yeah going like that yeah if i if i had considered this border then maybe maybe i could have found it but i'm pretty happy actually with my guests this is tricky again tiny tiny roads in in the forest basically this feels quite european again the sun is going the shadows are going north so we should be in the north hilly place can we see the roofs when they're very red some are very red roofs some are kind of more brownish orangish the road lines we have some dashed road lines here huh these dashes wait could this ever be sweden or maybe not sweden maybe like france because i feel like sweden sweden have different houses right maybe france france can sometimes have some road dash road lines like this possibly so i think my current best guess would be france which country could it be maybe with i think it would be too hilly for there could this be southern border maybe with like spain or andorra or maybe in this area it's it's not as hilly because i feel like in this this place it would be super way way more hilly than this we have some water here we have some water these roads do give me kinda like either andorra or spain spanish vibes i'm thinking that area i'm thinking like like french spanish border at this point let me find this water maybe in a very vertical water oh we have a vertical does it fit it kind of kind of looks similar it kind of looks super similar i just know you realize you can't really see it behind this compass it looks like looks like this behind my head how am i gonna align this if even if it is there down here we have a road right with kind of kind of like a big curve this is the big curve right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the big curve okay and we are kind of north of this little thingy on the road so we have we do have a kind of a big curve here big curve and then that very very very um sharp turn there i think this fits i think this fits very well i think we should be yeah like here on right on the border here oh my god [Music] let's go a big morale boost after a couple of couple of previous rounds okay this is a river big river that would is there a city or what why are the houses so far away from each other the shadows seem to be going slightly north at this point i'm thinking maybe somewhere in africa this this location is confusing me the the city or or town or what it is looks like a very big river my main guess would be but were there any rivers here i don't think we there were any rivers when i checked it in the one one of the previous zones oh there are there is like a river up here could that be maybe it to ghana and burkina faso that's the only river in this area i think no way i found it already is it fits it actually fits okay yeah and we have this this like a wind what i didn't even know there is a coverage here hippo sanctuary oh hippos are cute somewhere uh this is very approximate guess but okay 135 it's still okay still still a perfect score okay two two very good runs last one now last round okay we have a bigger city this time we have a bigger city where are the shuttle okay the roofs feel very european the shadows are going to the north we're driving the right side no surprises there where in europe would we be so we this is the board or huh there isn't even a checkpoint or anything so i'm thinking because of these roofs i was gonna get any uh portuguese vibes maybe something could this be portugal and spain border maybe what is this very bright what's with the road yeah all white road lines that that also works with europe look i guess let's let's have a look there somewhere what would fit it's interesting to to see how like in different different uh coverages there wasn't a road here and when you zoom in slightly boom two roundabouts and it looks like they're planning to to build even more road going ahead but anyways i'm getting distracted so easily we're looking for like like a big big road and going like that and the city of course pretty big looking city on the spanish portuguese border i don't know if it is actually that border but but that would be my main guess this one this one kinda this one kind of fits now two roundabouts and it looks like the road is finished now i think we should be here no i think that works yeah oh we were in spanish side apparently oh well wrong country but but still a perfect score in this round okay twenty 000 the first round was quite astonishing but the other ones i'm pretty happy with all the other rounds let me know how you did in these challenges and on the right side there will be another satellite view video that you can play along with huge thanks to all the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another

along video we are gonna try it out if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button and here we go the map is called the community world and it was made by over a hundred experienced players from all around the world so let's play it together and see how it goes the play along links as always will be in the description just make sure to play the games before watching this video so don't spoil anything something very wintery can we see the language uh can't really read it but i'm getting nordic vibes yeah these are these nordic looking houses with these white corners very nordic uh yeah white central lines so it wouldn't be norway right oh we have we have i totally missed this yellow sign somehow yeah we have this yellow sign and this yellow kind of directional sign as well i'm thinking this feels kind of swedish to me could be finland i guess but this sign i think in finland these red borders are a little bit thicker usually and this yellow sign also feels a bit more swedish than finnish this doesn't feel very northern so i would go maybe somewhere here ish and then hope for the best okay it was definitely wasn't northern as i suspected but it was more southern than i suspected okay near goltenberg i think that's a pretty good start pretty good start for the first guest what do we have now we have these white and black bollards you can find them in usually in indonesia and thailand so i would suspect this being one of those countries we have white central line that i notice oh when we have some language yeah it doesn't look like thai i was about to say that in thailand you quite often see yellow central line so since we have a white central line i was also kind of leaning more towards indonesia because of that i don't know tolango and balloon tio bulontiyo are those cities by any chance kalapai maybe that's a river this looks like some sort of a river maybe maybe that's the name of the river that we are over crossing over we have mountains to our south big mountains this doesn't really feel like java island to me i don't think we are on java which is this one this island i'm thinking maybe we could be sulawesi sumatra maybe those islands are so far away if i choose wrong well yeah no no points for me okay let's keep it there and hope for the best oh yes yes let's go still the other side of the island but i'm very happy i chose the right one this was tricky this was a very tricky one okay we have white central lines white central lines uh these oh these are australian bollards huh oh and this ball okay i know i sometimes struggle with with guessing where in australia i am but this pole you get these types of poles with kind of kind of like like brown sides in south south australia i think you can find them sometimes somewhere else but generally it will be south australia by the antenna we can also tell that we are driving the left side which would fit with australia what's what's the road direction and a little bit little bit diagonal almost almost straight up so maybe somewhere um i don't know here-ish probably not there um somewhere here maybe that that would be my main guess let's have a look and let's go this this is a good guess this was a good guess oh it even chose the right road actually okay not bad not bad around number four i'm i'm doing extra extraordinarily well this game oh this is generation two huh generation two camera house numbers like these huh okay i'm confused i'm i'm officially confused here i don't know what this is uh these types of house numbers usually like associated with like slovakia maybe or something but slovakia wouldn't have generation 2 now would it do we have the blue strip we do have the blue strip on the car plates i feel this must be a country that doesn't usually get generation for a generation 2 camera i feel so slow uh i i have to guess i have to guess oh i they feel slow slovakia and i'm going slow check yeah well check it was okay so they were checky and i i sometimes mix slovakia and checky i'm sorry they are so similar okay but also chicken doesn't usually get generation 2 coverage which also is confusing all things considered not too bad since that was a really tricky round these are israeli um sign colors black and white black and white these stripes you will see in israel and in the netherlands interestingly enough and of course we see the language it's hebrew so yeah this is definitely israel feels very dry and mountainous so i'm thinking probably more southern because northern areas of israel are generally more green more greenery you will see there i know it looks like it's quite hilly here maybe or even more southern i know it's it's even more hilly down here maybe let's risk it for the biscuit so to speak it would be cool if we could see some road numbers road numbers can be quite helpful in israel also yellow plates you will see in israel another clue i think let's go quite southern let's risk it because it is quite hilly in this area if i had more time i could align the roads and maybe try to find that way okay i was very wrong it was west bank even oh okay so a little controversial round let's not get political in the comments please how did we do in total 21 000 not too bad all in all i'm pretty happy with how this turned out let's go for another game let's go for the second game it is a challenge let's go double yellow lines uh this is an interesting sign almost kind of like a danish pipe going but this is not denmark for form what's with these signs i guess maybe in like some particular parts of north america they use signs like this i wasn't aware of that so learning something new i guess we do not have front plates here i feel like this has to be canada did ah which provinces did they use or and didn't use front plates in canada i think they used front plates in british columbia right british columbia would have been my main guess here with mountains like this i mean maybe that's just the just one car with no front plate as well i mean cars travel and these are some interesting arrows as well kind of interesting design wherever this is this is an interesting place i think i will still go british columbia or or somewhere here-ish maybe let's go was it alberta i was considering going western alberta no it was still british colombia okay nice let's go i'm very happy with this guess oh my god that's crazy that is crazy okay not bad not bad again double why are we getting north america so much today i'm not good at north american locations we have some front plates this feels yeah we have some palm trees this definitely is not canada this time no parking heliport speed limit sign uh i was no this wouldn't be hawaii right that's kahului sounds um hawaiian i'm really leaning towards hawaii because we have very dark kind of brown soil i don't know kahului it kind of sounds like hawaii kahului right oh my god oh my god where was it airport yes where's kahului airport are you kidding me oh heliport heliport not airport oh i'm guessing heliport might be near an airport i have no idea oh my dear lord okay oh i'm so happy okay it was okay helicopter is here okay oh my god oh my god that's crazy oh i'm starting off very strong but i can't sustain this tempo no chance so we have this google car oh we have a goto but yeah we have this google car which would indicate that we are in bangladesh even if we were not looking at the google cars i know some people really don't like them so if you don't look at them you can tell it apart by this text this language they use in some parts of india and bangladesh but in india the coverage just isn't there that much if you get the language like this generally it will be bangladesh as well driving on the left side a tuk-tuk as well quite common there i'm not sure where in bangladesh we might be though a little bit hilly but generally flat let's go maybe somewhere here-ish it looks like it might be a little bit hilly towards here to our east oh okay it was way more south okay fair enough fair enough well at least got the country right right so not too bad there we have long dashed lines on our sides which kind of feels norwegian to me doesn't it i don't remember if they used this m in norway well i'm guessing they probably did because i think these road lines are norwegian and then of course looking at the landscape just just these beautiful mountains fjords just i feel like it has to be norway right looking like this the trees the trees are kind of small trees are small thin which would make me think more northern in norway the road direction is like that so it's not going to be that bridge for sure this one maybe kind of alliance i don't know i might as well leave it there so hopefully it is okay not bad not bad wasn't as north as i thought but still 300 kilometers away that's a pretty good score i would say what do we have next the last round of this game we have dark back of the sign you see at least these dark backs in europe in italy quite often so that would be my first thought we have some palm trees as well in the distance yeah these are italian signs yeah these are italian plates with blue on both sides narrow front plates kind of shorter more narrow we did have a palm tree which would make me think probably more southern more southern italy also these these types of houses this architecture feels kind of more southern as well no idea which city though but i would maybe go something like naple we have some mountains to our north north east which would fit for naples we do have mountains there to the northeast yeah i think i'm pretty happy with my naples guests there oh okay it wasn't as southern it was coastal which explains the palm trees very small town yeah i wouldn't have would not have guessed there would not have guessed there but still how did we do 22 and a half thousand this time let's go let's go for the third game as well let's go for the third game of course link in the description and let's go let's go what is this what are the plates yeah we do have green plates okay as as i suspected as i suspected this felt kind of south korean to me from the first glance in south korea you often get this type of kind of like a fall or winter coverage like this you in south korea you will often get kind of green plate some of them now where in south korea quite often good clue are the phone numbers but well we don't have phone numbers here we have mountains around seoul it would not be this mountainous i i believe so i would go maybe somewhere closer to to to daegu or daejeon let's go daegu maybe because i know this area gets kind of more mountainous okay not bad not bad very happy with my score here 64 kilometers away we have miles per hour which would indicate um the us the u.s they use freedom units there so we have cr cr i think it means like something like country road or something so it's not very helpful gardner methodist church well yeah yeah gardner chuck wagon what's happening here is this place called gardner or something school wait is this the school where's the school this might be a small school i'm not sure i guess we have a playground outside this feels like a very small town in the us do we have front plates we do have front plates and we are running out of time we have a post box as well we have mountains we have mountains oh my dear lord where could we be uh color could this be colorado wyoming i'm kind of i'm gonna go my wyoming i don't know okay let's guess it was colorado oh no my first guess was closer but still wyoming not too bad i guess it felt a little bit more southern than wyoming but oh well still a good guess first thing i notice here what we see is this stripy ball on the right side these black and yellow stripes on the signposts you will see in botswana also the sign since it's facing the other way would indicate that we are driving the left side which would work first for botswana oh and well if you look at the sun it just says botswana as well which is also a good clue so we i think we might be in botswana we have yellow backplates as well as as you see in botswana so it's not going to be near gaborone i don't think because i think it's more dry there well i think it might be either somewhere up here or kind of northern botswana i believe let's get somewhere here let's see oh it was oh it was near gabaron just more south south of gaborone apparently is more green could have wished for a closer guess here but what can you do next this is brazil we have this brazilian pole with these kind of horizontal sections going through and this black back of the sign that's a common occurrence in brazil do we have any phone numbers by any chance no no we don't this satellite dish you see them a lot in brazil as well satellite dishes always point towards equatorial line always so it's if it's like a big country like brazil sometimes it is good to use those those satellite dishes to kind of understand which direction is the equator it looks it's hard to tell by the compass but it looks like the satellite dishes are pointing kind of very high up i think we are very close to equatorial line so we might be somewhere northern brazil another clue about it being brazil is this phone booth you see them in brazil a lot as well let's see if i am right i might be wrong that was so good let's go so yeah the satellite dishes can be helpful not always it's sometimes very difficult to read them properly by the compass but but when you when you can can be very helpful we have long antenna here we have some post boxes can we see the language uh can't really read it this is the last round of the game but i am kind of stuck it looks like it might be cyrillic no it looks like it might be surreally i'm thinking could this ever be russia this this type of church with this golden dome you see them a lot in in russia or orthodox church i think i don't know religions i'm taking long antennae very tropical looking i heal could it be somewhere like here like like southern russia somewhere like krasnodar [Music] we're out of time let's see oh not bad oh my god i'm on fire today oh my god not a bad guess 131 kilometers away in total let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges and what you think of this map i think it's pretty cool and i'm sure we'll play it in the future as well on the right side you will find another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to

"welcome back to another geographer satellite view video and today we're gonna play a map called airports around the world if you enjoy these satellite view videos press that like button and here we go if you want to play these challenges the links will be in the description just make sure you have the unity script installed if you don't know how to do it i will leave an info card up there with a video where i explain everything let's set the time limit to 10 minutes that should be enough um okay here up here is the airport let's have a look doesn't look like a very big airport one runway the shadows are going a little bit to the north yeah so we are in the northern hemisphere um the houses feel very european i would say uh kind of black roofs orange roofs brown roofs we have roundabouts in north america you don't see roundabouts very often so oh we have some dashed lines oh these these small dashes these small dashes you see in sweden sweden is one of the countries where you can get these small dashes when playing geography in the normal street view mode those small dashes are very helpful so my initial guess would be sweden because of those dashes the roofs could be swedish i guess why not i'm not the best with with roof recognizing but oh ikea okay that that's that's it that it is sweden 100 it's sweet and we have an ikea here water we have some big water kind of kind of with kind of small stretchy islands um to our southeast if i'm not mistaken sweden has the most islands in the world right because all of these small ones each one of them is counted as an island so they have the most islands in the world fun fact so we have this this this big water to our south east the city the city doesn't seem too small so it should be noticeable there's another city here kind of like a coastal city oh this okay i think this fits this river going through here and then we have a smaller city here we have a bigger city here i think this fits yeah so the airport we are in the airport which is right should be yes umea airport where was the ikea here is the ikea okay i think i've heard this pronounced both ways and let me say ikea we should be um somewhere here in the parking lot and we have this road going with the with the curve and i think we should be like right here okay five meters let's go next round we are zoomed in definitely not on the airport let's zoom out and see where the airport is okay this looks like a bigger airport with a couple of runways here so that would make me think this might be a bigger city well it should be the the shadows are going it looks like the shadows might be going to the south yeah they they kind of are yeah going to the south so we should be in the southern hemisphere are there any texts on the on the air airfield people people in my comments often say that i don't pay enough attention to airports so i thought this might be a good map to try because i have to pay attention to the airports now because supposedly they often contain helpful clues that i never see and um i don't see anything helpful here either this time let's have a look at the roads maybe which side are we driving on we're going to the right side okay if i if i had to guess my my first guess would maybe be argentina but wait okay okay so so so this is a coastal city actually i just noticed when this this shape the shape reminds me of uruguay of montevideo this is the shape of the big city with a big city with the coast through the south south east i think this could be montevideo and the big airport would also make sense the shape yeah the shape is right yeah we have this um lighthouse here not too many cities in the in the southern hemisphere are with the coast to the southeast and and this big i guess let's look at it and where is the airport here here is the airport international here is the roundabout what what i was thinking argentina at first is because i've seen a lot of roundabouts in argentina that's that's why it popped in my mind first but but surely you can get around the bots in other countries too okay now this this type of neighborhood makes me think america immediately like us canada maybe this kind of kind of neighborhood with like a dead end you see them a lot of movies in like games the shadows are going north so we would be in the northern hemisphere so that that fits the airport oh this is a big one that's some sort of a railway in the middle of a an airport i have never seen that that there is a railway in the middle of an airport i i guess yeah the the trains go below the airplanes here this is a huge airport so it should be near a huge city i would assume again let's let's maybe zoom in on the other parts of city because i don't see anything helpful in the airport we have a big stadium big football stadium oh wake for wake forest texas texas a m okay if it was only wake forest i would have no idea where that is but um texas i know where texas is smart and we have a baseball field we have another football field so it just all confirms that this is the u.s so i guess let's have a look in texas we have a small river here to our kind of kind of left of the airport a pretty big city in texas with a river to the west okay just by zooming in i didn't notice okay let's have another look what is this dallas love field airport does that align no it doesn't align uh i don't know let's keep it there and see it was it wasn't even texas why did it say texas i feel scammed why is this in charlotte excuse me my dear american viewers why did it say texas in charlotte can anyone explain i'm i'm so confused i i feel scammed okay at least at least i don't feel as bad anymore that i couldn't find the city in texas because because it wasn't there oh my god it literally like spent like i don't know seven minutes looking through texas again a huge city that we can't see and with an airport yes with an airport pretty big airport as well as you might expect quite a few roundabouts sun the shadows are to the north so we should be in the northern hemisphere we are driving on the left side interestingly enough so i'm thinking could be maybe uk well it doesn't look like london to me i'm thinking like like manchester birmingham somewhere there may be one of those the houses are pretty big i know at least in london the houses are quite narrow but maybe in other cities they get wider i don't see any like lakes or rivers that could really help us much but what we're looking for is a really big city with an airport to the kind of east south east so birmingham manchester those would be my my first maybe thoughts are there any airports there is an airport here does that fit does that fit um it actually is oh my god it actually fits yeah we have this this this curve again when we are we are on this roundabout where is the roundabout is this the roundabout i think it is yeah let's just guess there okay after the previous round this was a nice breeze of fresh air we have this is a very mountainous country so my first thoughts are like something like nepal bhutan somewhere in that area india possibly i don't know yeah you can see the mountains like moving very hilly i'm assuming in real life that the runway doesn't go like that we have quite a few pools than i notice that kind of kind of surprises me because i don't think you get that many pools in like bhutan for example we have a kind of red and blue look very colorful rooms the sun is where is the sun going i'm thinking could this be brazil's or something maybe the sun is the shadows are kind of a little bit to the south maybe quite quite central to be fair so this might be in the area of equatorial line which said are we driving on i don't i didn't check yet it does look like we are driving the right side which would would fit with brazil if it is brazil where in brazil could it be though some mountains i know like the this part of brazil is quite mountainous but i feel it would be like more developed and you would see more roads and bigger cities in this area so i'm not sure maybe somewhere up here-ish i don't i don't know if it would fit with in terms of the mountains i i don't have a good guess here i'm not sure if the mountains would fit with this area that's what concerns me the most and i and it doesn't fit with the southern part where where i know it is definitely mountainous what else could it be ecuador colombia could it be those i'm not sure if this map has something like venezuela or not my mind always goes by default to the countries who has who have official google coverage i guess we can check those because the mountains both both of these countries are very mountainous i know that for sure we're looking for a stretched out city with an airport to the left we really don't have much time so i should stop talking and start searching yeah the time is about to run out uh i'll just keep it here i think is it i think it's more likely than brazil but i i couldn't find anything that i thought matches so oh it was ah i zoomed in on this city but ah oh my god it was so tiny oh this was a rough one yeah i did there isn't even a proper city there from from the distance no no way i would have found it this was a rough round but i'm pretty happy that at least i went the right area almost 4 000 points so i'm happy about that 20.6 k in the first game let's go but let's play again if you are playing along let me know in the comments how you are doing in these games i'm always interested to read your comments about your scores okay we have an airport with like a couple of runways um the the city is definitely big as you can see which way is the sun going this shadows are a little bit to the north the houses just just feel very american again this is this grid grid road kind of parallel roads so we're looking for another american city can we find any stadiums i'm kind of weary about stadiums now because of the texas situation that we had earlier what is this supes falls cougars i don't know where silks falls is unfortunately i'm guessing that's the place where we are maybe siokes falls sucks falls bunch of tennis courts more tennis courts they really like to play tennis in this place we don't have any good identifying features here kind of like a round-ish city with an airport to the north and a bunch of agricultural fields around [Music] now i could not find it i'm thinking it's probably a smaller city not like atlanta or nashville but something a bit smaller maybe near a bigger city okay maybe let's switch to somewhere here okay sioux falls it is a city i have not heard of sioux's falls before isn't even that small okay well if if i knew about silks falls i could have found it but oh no that's a terrible terrible start oh wow this is a huge city much bigger than shuuk's falls with such a huge city not that much of a bigger of an airport my first thoughts are maybe india here but let's let's investigate a little see um what kind of clues can we gather the house roofs are kind of kind of blue and gray which which side are we driving on can we tell it does look like we're doing the left side here so i think india is a really good shout with such a huge city i don't know if this could be new delhi i remember i had new delhi in the famous place video but i think new delhi looked a bit different but maybe we were just looking at a different part of new delhi that's also possible so what we have is like a big big road that goes kind of around around the city so we maybe can use that for um identification purposes so let's uh have a look at new daily at first we have a road we do have a big road that goes around does that align though not really i wanted it to align but it doesn't no i i don't think this is new daily um what else could it be let's check some other big indian cities maybe let's let's not throw away the the india guests just yet we have a lot of greenery here could this be pakistan the bigger cities don't fit at least could it actually be new delhi that i kind of kind of overlooked maybe maybe like a smaller part of new delhi we don't see that river though we don't see that river that goes through delhi and new delhi india has so many cities it's crazy could we could be literally anywhere and it's not jaipur either right it just doesn't align in jaipur has some mountains as well wait we do have some mountains these are kind of hilly hilly jaipur international airport let's have a look wait is it is it actually it i didn't think it aligns we do have a roundabout yo i it's actually jaipur i didn't think it aligns why did i not think it aligns because i did look at jaipur earlier but i didn't see this this road going all around the city how did i miss it it is there how did i miss it the weird thing is i looked at it earlier but okay let's move on so here is the airport this is oh like bunch of bunch of like angers for planes the airport doesn't seem too big this feels like europe i would say looking at the houses and then the shadows going to the north so we should be in the northern hemisphere driving in the right side as well so that that confirms it could be europe what a mountainous area and quite a dry one as well it seems looking this dry i was thinking i think the most sense makes turkey i think because looking this dry yet still looking quite european because in other european countries i just can't see them looking this dry like you can get some some dry places in like italy but but i don't think they look like this from above so so my main guess would be something like turkey or could it be israel possibly or not jordan it wouldn't be jordan so i'm thinking somewhere in that area doesn't look like a too huge of a city okay let's let's start looking in turkey maybe so what we're looking for is like a city with a with a small river going to the side and an airport of course and some hills around so it wouldn't be it wouldn't be up here up here it's very green mountains so i would say it's somewhere probably kind of kind of more in a good central eastern area somewhere there so let's let's have a look somewhere around there if we can find something i think cogna looks kind of similar but we don't have a river going through okay i i think it's batman i think it's batman batman is like a joke in geogaser um community everyone knows about batman i think it actually is batman this time because we have a river the city shape kind of fits and we have an airport batman is always bigger than i anticipate what i noticed that a couple of turkish cities have similar shapes got a bunch of them were looking kind of like this i wonder if there's any particular reason for that yeah we have this road we should be right here i think nice round number four where is the airport oh we have a big river that could be helpful the quality is not the best unfortunately the airport is not very big either only one runway where do the shadows go the shadows go to the north okay so we're in the northern hemisphere pretty big river to our north which side are we driving on it looks like we're driving the left side here huh well initially i was thinking africa so driving on the left side and being in the northern hemisphere kenya uganda i'm not sure do they have such a big river going through let's check it quickly kampala not really nairobi not really maybe coastal mombasa ombasa it does have big waters but not like this maybe bangladesh could this ever be bangladesh or india again this is a really really really big river here maybe malaysia could just be malaysia to have a river going through here that i mean the direct direction would be similar it's the closest that i've found yet but but no no maybe it is still bangladesh but but elsewhere not dhaka because the this river does kind of feel similar with these small small pathways so maybe it is bangladesh just just not darker cause dhaka didn't align well this be it wait could it be it yo it kinda looks like it is no you have this thing and then bunch of smaller like like things like islands i think it is wait is it it's indie it is india wow okay so it was indie oh interesting i think i remember watching some some videos about this river but china wants to build some dams like a higher in the river and then it might kind of overflow india and bangladesh getting off topic again we have an airport so here so we're kind of here in the parking lot basically i think nice nice 14 meters let's go and the last round oh is that water i like water and satellite view it is water so we are coastal let's go let's go so if it's coastal in a huge city like this it shouldn't be too difficult to find i hope i hope very big city let's look at the airport big airport as well bunch of runaways all over the place any texts at all that could help me not that i can see this is probably not the best place for a hotel it's so close to such a big airport if you visit this place that's probably not the hotel for you which way does the sun go which side we are driving on we're doing the right side the shadows are going a little bit to the north it seems but not much maybe northern brazil there are some bigger cities there but with the roofs fits we have a lot of very like white roofs would this be something like whoop grease maybe where did the map go like like like uh crete maybe heraklion or something because i know greece has a lot of white roofs uh well heracleon doesn't align so it's not gonna be here but maybe it's still a different city in this area cyprus it's not gonna be cyprus i feel like this map has coverage from countries with official coverage from what i've seen thus far now the coast doesn't align i didn't know that this map has only official coverage countries because when playing satellite view i kind of like to play um that it could be anywhere and i can expand the geogra even more but still this is a good fun in my opinion turkey could this maybe be a northern turkey this is not gonna be istanbul though no no and the other northern cities are very hilly and not as big i genuinely don't know with these white roofs i was thinking greece but doesn't align nothing in the area really aligns we have a baseball field so maybe somewhere in americas i was thinking mexico but the mexico i don't know the roofs don't feel american but but with a baseball field on driving on the right side maybe another supposed baseball field here so maybe u.s or southern u.s or mexico another baseball field so many baseball fields it has to be america's somewhere but with with coast wait could this be puerto rico puerto rico makes sense with with water to the north i think puerto rico had some some kind of kind of like bathe like this i think puerto rico makes sense i didn't know puerto rico's white roofs it is yeah it is it is it is we have this bridge here too we are right here nice one nice and another perfect score and 22 000 in total let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges and on the right side you will find another satellite view video where you can play along huge thanks to all the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the

i will be doing my best to get a good score in them each location will have a hint and if you want to play along the links and the hints will be in the description don't forget to press that like button and after watching this video don't forget to check out zigzag's video where he plays my maps so here we go the first challenge that zigzag has created no time limit no moving but we can pan and zoom and this is all official that's right so what's the what's the hint here so this location is is within 150 kilometers of four capital cities oh wow 150 kilometers from four capital cities wow that's interesting we have some black chevrons and that many capital cities this is a weird what are these bollards i don't recognize these bollards the ballard king himself but does he know i don't recognize these are some weird ones you have found these black and white black and white chevrons um i know a couple of countries where you can get them like um italy greece albania spain sometimes i'm so i'm thinking in that area but you always have your uh you always have your hints as well yeah i have i have the three power-ups i'm thinking maybe should i use it on the first location already wait can i see the plate the car is a bit too far the car is a bit too far to see the plate the palm trees are throwing me i was thinking like maybe something like albania but but would albany have palm trees like this okay i'm gonna ask is this greece by any chance this is not greece look albania oh god maybe kind of southern albania but this mountain is there it isn't that hilly here i mean we do have some hills around but yeah we do and we do i've only had compass yeah compass would help that's for sure oh no okay i think i'll go with albania uh but but where is kind of flatter in albania maybe somewhere here but i'm afraid my guess will be so wrong but okay i'll i'll i'll go there let's see oh okay i see israel interesting yeah oh that was a hard round i was so surprised when i saw that plantation there palm trees makes sense makes more sense for israel than albania that's for sure but that is an interesting one i didn't know israel also has those chevrons yeah and and so we're like right between those four capital cities of the four countries around it and also there were yellow outside lines but they were very hard to make out like this where you could yeah the sun was shining in a way that made them look white they looked all white to me yeah but okay at least some points at least i get something yeah you got some points it's not too bad not too bad okay let's go for the next one let us okay i see okay what's the clue here okay so the clue is that we here we are 10 kilometers from the east coast of this nation okay so it's a coastal country that's good to know we have generation two that's also nice to notice very rural location and mountainous as well that's that's also good mountains well my first thought was maybe somewhere south african maybe because i know you can get quite green there and it definitely has a lot of mountains so my my initial thought was maybe somewhere somewhere year-ish i think i might ask for hemisphere on this one what what hemisphere is this this one is in the northern hemisphere northern okay okay so it's not gonna be south africa i'm gonna switch up the time time to switch my thinking what could it be i wasn't thinking it looks particularly european but what else could it be generation two could this ever be asia what are those things are those houses in the distance or i'm not sure either to be honest but i'm i'm curious to know as well i don't even know this continent well at least i know the hemisphere now mexico could this will be mexico when mexico can't have gen 2 that actually kind of makes sense i think i might go yeah kind of kind of eastern mexico look around this area i think that that's my best shot here let's oh that one oh no wow cheeky gen 2 taiwan i did consider taiwan in my mind but but i thought just did you think it was like look at the latitude though at least something was right yeah yeah oh no not the great greatest that was a very tough round i've been a little mean on some of these no no challenge is good okay okay what do we have here okay so this one simple clue the nearest town to this location is called mona mona mona mona o m-o-n-a m-o-n-a monomona so it is it looks generation four oh we have a yellow sign in the distance it's kind of on the left side of the road so does that mean that we are driving on the left side i'm currently thinking maybe something like malaysia i don't know if malaysia would have mona mona as an as a place yeah i don't think i should focus on mona mona too much because because i feel like that that's going to only distract me in the wrong way for me because you have your continent clue as well of course oh yeah that's that's a fair point so you can ask me for the continent as well for me mona mona sounds kind of african maybe but that might be very wrong i'll i'll i'll go with my god i think i will go malaysia but i'm really afraid that it's going to be very wrong um i don't know let's go kind of in the middle-ish maybe australia yup oh monomona oh makes sense makes sense for australia yeah a lot of like double double town names it's quite common over here yeah like wagga wagga i know yeah i should have thought of it okay not going very well for me thus far okay oh this is interesting what's the clue here okay so this island was occupied by the british for just a few years in the early 1800s hmm so just a few years just the next few years okay just a few years occupied by i mean british have occupied everything so it's not the most useful question yeah but it isn't that's that's the big that's the island yeah that we have this is an these trees are very interesting i'm not the greatest with with flora but but i think i've seen some similar trees like in like in chile somewhere but but would brits have occupied an island in chile could this be australia again but i mean you said the brits occupied it for short time the island right that's right that's right that's about five years um it's probably not australia then what is it what what is it it doesn't look like a bollard it looks like some sort of uh look at like a hydrant but why here would make no sense i'm not starting to think could this be something like azores maybe because they do have some some different trees from from europe from mainland and it they do have gen gen 2 maybe maybe i should just go azores because i don't think continent would help much because i'm not i don't even know where zazor is part of africa or europe there might be i think i think canaries are europe and azores i mean canary africa and azores might be europe but i could be wrong possibly but i wouldn't know i remember so if i asked for continent and you said no it's not europe it wouldn't really help me here if i'm considering azores if it isn't the source i'm far away from everything so that's true it's not good that's generally my best guess so i think i'll go around there oh wow what it's a danish island wow peter the reason these are in this map is because i saw them i was like what is this these have been hard rounds these have been yeah you you ha you haven't uh haven't held back pulled no punches pulled no punches yeah yeah okay the last round here okay so this is a town of about 10 000 people and it has a record high temperature of 35 degrees okay so so relatively small town we have some stickers here taxi oh what's the language the quality is just bad enough so i can't really tell what the language is turkish by any chance does turkey have gin 2 maybe some spares i don't know i've been known to find some regen 2s for you know which continent well i guess most of turkey is considered asia right though so so i'm gonna ask is this asia this is not asia this is not asia oh no oh no i guess wait what is that another red and white flag there could this be poland i mean the houses this could be maybe northern polish poland with gen again you don't usually get gen 2 in poland but maybe you could get some some rare ones oh we have a cyrillic letter here on this one this boat and like oh all the texts are just far enough so i can't properly read pop rappers that's right i'm i'm thinking maybe you should go somewhere like north of poland near kaliningrad or something do we see any land we do you see some land in the distance there so maybe it could be could be somewhere like here-ish let's let's hope for the best let's see it oh let's go let's go oh my god i'm so happy about this through at the end at least at least one one good guys this game so i guess it was polish flag that cyrillic was tricky but in a way it helped yeah yeah yeah i was i was too cheeky with some of these locations yeah yeah 6800 in total i'm sure many viewers will will beat me on this one so now here we have some tracker coverage which which might be might be trickier but i still i i hope i will beat my my um previous score what's what's the hint here so the hint here is that this island lies on the same latitude as peru um but it is a territory of a northern hemisphere country oh okay that's an interesting one that's an interesting one i usually hate beach locations like like with passion because all the beaches look the same to me ng i guess sir yes indeed there's at least at least some nicer clues on this the clue is good i like the clue yeah so same latitude as peru but belongs to someone uh in a country of in northern hemisphere so i'm thinking maybe uk france they they they own a ton of countries i was thinking british indian ocean territory possibly that was my first thought there the latitude kind of would fit and it does belong to the uk and then what else could it be well wouldn't be these islands you could also turn on your uh compass as well by the way oh right right right okay i i think that i really don't have any other good good guesses or other than somewhere here so we have water wait do we see we do see some some land in the distance so i'm thinking maybe we could be then on this side yeah i think i'll go go here and hope for the best oh no yeah oh wow wait what even what what the hell there isn't even anything there it's part of american samoa but yeah oh my god yeah sorry about that one what the hell that was a little mean oh no next round i hope not all of the locations are like that no no no no okay this one so here we have a national park which is surprisingly close to numerous very large metro populations okay so we have sun to well basically in the sky okay maybe a little bit to the north hard to tell behind the clouds i was thinking ecuador but but but multiple metro populations national park i have all all of the um power-ups still available all of them remaining all of them i think i'll ask for the hemisphere on this one yep this one is in the northern hemisphere northern hemisphere okay so probably not ecuador i'm not sure about the plants feel kind of not very european or maybe southern european if it is i don't see any houses in the distance which sucks the boats don't help me too much maybe maybe i guess i guess this might be asia oh what if this is like could this ever be hong kong hmm and it does have a bunch of very large populations nearby that's true and i know hong kong is mountainous and and and and you can get a bunch of coverage there but we have some water to our north east northeast there is like an island i don't know i don't think it aligns perfectly maybe this one somewhere here this feels quite rural i'm not sure if there is coverage there but i i hope so so let's go let's go there let's go oh let's go baby let's go oh no that was that was crazy good that was crazy oh thank you thank you you got the right national park i love cal you just kept on getting closer and closer you had the right thought process that was great yeah the hint really helped here with the multiple big big kind of metro areas nearby hey what do we have next oh no another beach why are you doing this to me i think this is the last speech okay so unesco says that this is one of the few atolls in the world whose ecology has been practically untouched by human presence okay in other words very remote very remote very remote okay so still two hints with the last three rounds to go so the sun is to the north so so we should be in the southern hemisphere here a lot of ocean in the southern hemisphere so so not excited about that what could i think i was thinking maybe it could be somewhere like like in oceania or or if it's white remote then then i imagine um it would be hard for me to find if i saw some birds i would think maybe it's a dorito island as well no no classic midway at all birds no no birds this time yeah for me it's just basically choose choose a remote island and hope for the best at this point and i think prince edward islands had some coverage so so it isn't at all it's one of the few atolls in the world whose ecology has been practically untouched few atolls what's the definition of atoll or a ring-shaped coral reef island okay that's what atoll is okay all the atolls i knew were in the northern hemisphere so that kind of screws it up for me i'll i'll i'll be nice this one is marked on the map it isn't you can click somewhere it does have at least a pui or something like that uh-huh this one looks like an atoll would that have covered official coverage i have zero idea but it looks like an atoll it is in the southern hemisphere so i think that might be my best shot i think i'll go there not even oh it was bitcoin islands okay i didn't know bitcoin islands are considered at all yeah it didn't well this is just what google told me so i could be wrong but um but uh yeah i also thought it didn't look particularly at all like with the with the hill in the background so sorry if that was yeah it kind of threw me off a little bit but but uh yeah at least that wasn't too far definitely could have been way more for like if you zoom out all the way it looks very close for a remote island i think it is pretty pretty okay indeed so google also told me that's in south america so i was kind of scared if you asked about the continent because well oh you wouldn't really pick an island with south america would you yeah not really that's for sure yeah yeah okay clear for this one clue for this one this island is an uplifted coral atoll it is believed to have been discovered first by the spanish but was also occupied by the united states at one point however it neither lies in north america nor europe neither north america nor europe yeah that's an interesting fact that it was discovered by europeans and then held by north americans no so we have santa the south so it should be northern hemisphere and if it's neither north america nor europe i would go asia because i know spanish explorers did explore bunch of asia and u.s explores everything and owns everything so but that wouldn't surprise me either ever another very heliotol apparently at all yeah oh i don't know which atolls are hilly and which ones aren't unfortunately me neither but i'm just surprised i'm just also surprised it's according to both of them but yeah there you go so so it might not look like an at all so i have country and i have continent right so i might as well use one of them on this one so we have all white road lines which is interesting so if the hint was it used to be owned by us right it isn't anymore right it was occupied by that occupied okay it was occupied by u.s maybe this is like japan [Music] i think this might be japan i guess i might as well ask uh uh i might as well ask the country is this japan it is japan peter let's go let's go let's go so okay we have big water to the west with absolutely no land in sight okay and definitely worth keeping in mind that the spanish were the like they're thought to be the first ones to ever find this even [Music] maybe those are one of these islands i don't remember if those were these islands or something or was it this island but i remember i was watching like a video where um tokyo owns like one of those like a super remote island and counts like like a part of tokyo this is quite weird oh japan has so many islands i managed to we'll just guess somewhere and then hope for the best but there is nothing to our south as well nothing to the south nothing to the west i think i might go somewhere here and hope for the best i see it now let's go let's go another oh my god let's go we're interesting that i didn't see this island yeah that is interesting actually weird but still i'm very happy i'm only 10 kilometers away up 10 kilometers apart basically so you're coming back from behind coming back yeah at least yeah decent score by this point so what what's what's the hint on the last one this island has a landing fee of roughly uh five us dollars which or or about you know roughly four euro 66 and it's also located in a city ireland located in a city that has a landing be interesting i'm looking at the architecture trying to trying to figure out what is is this europe some of the houses look quite european to me so i have continent remaining that's right yeah continents so at the sun the sun where is the sun the sun oh the sun is to the north huh okay so probably not europe then could this ever be australia the houses didn't feel particularly australian to me south america maybe okay i think i'm gonna ask is this south america this is not in south america oof i mean australia new zealand make the only sense then i guess maybe maybe it's like there are a couple of islands near auckland so i don't know if it counts as part of auckland but it's pretty close so it isn't really a line does it we have city to our in the southeast don't forget the landing fee so to set foot on the place it's about five dollars yeah i'm looking for for like an airport or something but i don't see one oh would this ever be something like sydney when i when i say landing it i don't doesn't necessarily have to be from an airplane oh okay okay yeah but thank you anyway you can get there okay it doesn't look like a very large city to our at least east and there are some houses but but i think the the cit this sydney part would look different ford we don't have a fort here do we um okay clark island maybe i don't know this might not even be sydney i'm just just looking around at the islands at this point okay let's i don't know i think i'll go what i think i'll keep it there maybe it's a different australian city or maybe it's it's something completely else see oh my god oh my god that's insane wow you came back so hard that's crazy at the end there wow wow okay i did not expect that that's for sure wow i would not expect you to do so much better on the tracker as well i thought the tracker ones are the hard ones if you haven't seen zig zag's video i will leave it in the description go and check it out huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube

play some maps that my viewers have made for me if you enjoy these play along videos don't forget to press that like button and here we go the first map we're gonna play is called country borders which contains country borders as as you might expect let's play it one minute 30 as always the playlong links will be in the description just make sure to play them before watching this video so and don't spoil locations so here we go the first location okay this should be europe i'm thinking latvia first first thing it is latvia these are latvian signs this is a european union border right i think it's a border with lithuania i think this is latvian and lithuanian border i don't know where sudata is look guys let's quickly scan the border these are latvian signs oh is it b oh that might be a b not a d sub here we go does the does the road align the road aligns yeah and do we have a road going out i think we should be here oh no okay we were the other side of the border okay but it's still a perfect score didn't align it properly but but it still is a perfect score let's go good start okay the next one looks way more difficult oh no we have a long antenna on the google car what i see some electricity wires not looking very safe don't don't want to go near those that's an interesting tower could this be like a russian border with with china or something i don't know i was thinking europe at first but the tower doesn't look european at all it looks very asian to me so so i was thinking maybe russia i know russia can have some some long antennas on google cars but russian and chinese borders surely would have been more guarded than this well maybe we are a little bit off the border i'm not sure i have no idea i might be like like thousands of kilometers away on this this might just be somewhere in europe but this tower this tower throws me off the most because of this tower i'm guessing somewhere here might be maybe nearby north korea maybe actually but again it was oh it was north korea ah okay interesting okay and that i guess was the tuman tumangang buddhist temple that we saw in the distance maybe interesting so that was north korea that we saw there so kind of the right right idea just uh guess the wrong area but still not not a bad score i'm pretty happy with this one oh here we have yellow sidelines you get these yellow dashed lines uh if you're in europe in ireland so so that's my first thought this kind of feels european and then with these yellow dashes i would think ireland and if this is an uh border with ireland then surely it's ireland and the uk the north and the northern ireland judging by this sign i would say yes we are driving the left side since it's facing the other way there really isn't anything else here okay what's the road direction the road direction is kind of diagonal so maybe well not there let's just try to find a road that maybe alliance maybe this one this one kind of would somewhat fit i'm not sure if we have a some intersections towards our south or not uh now this field this road that we are on feels more straight this just just a lock game basically a lucky guess i'm not sure if we're entering uh entering northern ireland or exiting northern ireland okay it okay it wasn't even on on the exact board or just nearby so still good guess not a bad one oh no okay this is unofficial coverage there is absolutely nothing around us oh this is gonna be bad this is gonna be a terrible round y'all we have the author's name is ken oh can can see 64 doesn't help at all these houses in the distance these feel kind of maybe american in a way so i'm thinking could this be maybe u.s and canadian border just because of these these houses feel kind of maybe american a little bit but i'm i might be very wrong about that there really isn't anything at all other other than that just some fields some some some lakes okay let's go it's it's a little bit hilly but not quite flat in general i don't know maybe somewhere here minnesota ontario border there are some some small lakes possibly here oh but there's a river oh no here lost river state we're not in the forest okay let's go here okay it actually was u.s canadian border okay just more west i'm i feel like i'm doing pretty well especially in such a such a difficult round where there was nothing available let's go let me know in the comments how you are all doing if you are beating me or not i always enjoy reading your comments and i respond to all of the comments as well um we have a deer i can't read what that truck says turismo the language looks quite spanish what's the author's name gabriel pay this is unofficial coverage so it could be any country not necessarily the ones who have coverage official one uh this flag kind of feels like it might be like paraguay right we're gonna red white and um blue maybe so this might be like a paraguayan border with something we have 30 seconds remaining i'm not sure about the plates that we see can't really read what they say i would go paraguay maybe like like but there is a river there i mean we might be on one side of a river why not somewhere here maybe but that city is too big no idea let's get somewhere paraguay isn't too big so if it is paraguay then we shawn it wasn't paraguay well up until this point i was doing pretty good and we ended in nicaragua nicaragua and costa rica border the bus threw me off without a bus would i have guessed there honestly i don't know but yeah well the bus didn't help us i don't know maybe i missed something if you if you find some clues that i have missed then let me know i always um enjoy some feedback the next map we're going to play is called a harder world version 2 which contains locations that don't have flags signs languages or license plates which it does sound difficult so i'm not expecting a good score by myself uh but let's go let's see what what kind of locations do we get here okay unofficial one again mitchell moore is the author you all know i i'm not good and i don't like beach locations i just don't like them but but here it is here is one beach location the car in the distance the car feels kind of maybe european maybe so i'm thinking and in general like the nature and everything just feels maybe kind of mediterranean just just going by the by the feeling that i have i think i will go somewhere mediterranean could this be italy um maybe uh let's go italy maybe uh uh since this is unofficial we cannot trust the compass as as you know so there is no point really aligning anything let's go somewhere kind of southern italy maybe this could easily be something completely else but let's have a look oh my god i was not thinking that looks like hawaii oh my god no way i would have guessed hawaii on that location well the map title checks out it is a harder world oh we have official coverage okay the first first glance it feels very a brazilian but would this be brazilian it definitely feels like it i don't see any poles oh wait um hard to see if it is brazilian pole or not can't really read the languages either we have a super red soil quite hilly and and i i would definitely go brazil here for four with this type of red soil and hills all around my main guest would be somewhere down here because it is quite hilly and with the red soil in this area i was looking if we see some piranha pines because in this area you will often see um the piranha pines but but i don't see those pines here but but but but i would still go maybe maybe a bit more more south somewhere somewhere here okay it was a bit more north okay it was a little bit more north but i got the general area so i'm happy with that third round again unofficial one again beach oh my god uh okay the author is lakshan not sure i might be wrong but it kind of sounded a bit indian to me i might be very wrong i'm not the best at recognizing name origins would this be india why not i can never tell where the beaches are from no signs not much just just i'm guessing that's a hotel and very non-descript hotel i'm not sure it might be it might be africa as well possibly since my first thought was india i'm gonna go india but could be literally anywhere i think oh sri lanka okay not too bad actually right area i guess the name might have been from that area actually so my might have been right pursue pti ltd limited something so unofficial tracker coverage uh unofficial photosphere these signs like no parking signs and these trucks feel very american to me we have some like looking at the the houses and the trees feels quite southern these trees are usually associated with florida we'll see if i'm right about that so my menus would be florida here we have some some like i think this this is used to carry boats maybe let's go something like uh i'm not sure should i go miami or jacksonville tampa did we just go in the middle in orlando let's go in the middle in orlando why not oh wow i was so wrong oh no it was near sydney a very late well i couldn't see which side we were driving on the cars were too far but i guess you can get similar trees in australia as well newcastle well i guess those no parking signs were not the ones that i was thinking of ouch that was a painful round uh slava brucha slava brucha is the author sounds kind of um like like slavic slavic origin maybe the houses this church yeah the houses and everything does feel kind of possibly like either russia or eastern europe it looks very flat wherever this is thinking maybe ukraine maybe russia um somewhere in that area i think i'm gonna go ukraine let's go let's go poltava maybe kind of somewhere there in case it is russia then we're kind of a little bit closer to to that border okay oh that's a good guess let's go i'm happy with this it was ukraine near pavlo grad oh no sorry pablo hrad i mean it is pavlo grad in in cyrillic so let's do the summary how did it go it was a hard map that's for four but but the first round no not the first round the second round the third round and the fifth round i'm happy about the other two not so much and the third round is called cities of the world good luck geopeter thank you for the good luck wishes so again the challenge link in the description oh good luck me and good luck you as well who is playing along so we have these um stripes these black and white stripes you can see a lot of in the netherlands also we have yellow plates which you can see in the netherlands so we should be in the netherlands rotterdam rotterdam it says on the sign so uh i would assume it i hope it is rotterdam uh what is what else does it say holland brengan i don't know what that is allen brengan but we are like a huge roundabout a huge roadblock on the hilton hotel can we find a huge roundabout and a hilton hole there is a big round about here holiday inn there's a big roundabout but i don't see oh hilton rotterdam hey it is wait hilton is to our south west the hilton uh we should be somewhere here no yes no i think so i think we are here okay i hope all these locations are like this okay okay good start good start what is that viva fresh store kfc oh what is this this is unofficial now um this sign feels kind of maybe albanian we do a blue strip on the left side we have blue strip on the right oh kosovo we have kosovo flag an albanian flag so both kosovo and an albanian flag so we might be in kosovo near albania maybe prison gyakova may be one of those cities uh does it say is the city somewhere the author is mentor descu there's not galleria e arteve now that that's art gallery it doesn't say the city poshtrica is pashtrika of city maybe post-rick no it isn't we're looking for kfc and viva fresh store okay let's just zoom in here do we see kfc or viva fresh store somewhere don't see a kfc here well i don't have much time to look for it but with glancing over didn't see it maybe somewhere here 10 seconds remaining leave a fresh store kfc somewhere maybe no don't see it don't see it it was ah it was it was in the other city i didn't see it oh there is viva fresh story ah okay fc might not be anymore i did notice ham ham fast food but that's not kfc okay there was viva fresh store if i had more time i probably would have found it but still a pretty pretty good guess i would say 32 kilometers away only i like this map because these well the first two locations were pretty findable what is this one this one feels less findable we are in mongolia because of the google car this big kind of camping setup and a snorkel on the right side you have some cows i think those are small cows yeah not not many signs well i just know it's mongolia and the road is going kind of diagonally we have we do have a gas tank and a city could it be somewhere here does the road turn the road doesn't really turn what are some bigger cities maybe somewhere here i i don't think it's all on bottom though but but other than that i know so there are some people in the community who can find any mongolian location but but i can't let's go somewhere here that that city might be might be either kind of correct okay it was completely the opposite side of mongolia uh unfortunate unfortunate it aligns right yeah we have that gas station the road direction fits could i have gotten it i don't see how but okay let's move on to the fourth one a drone footage uh the author is drones tachira tachira drone strategy a ct name if it is i have not heard of it before so it doesn't help me much tachira oh what do we have zona official this feels it might be something like south america maybe la ville do we see any electricity counters there too far the quality isn't good enough to see the electricity counters unfortunately we have some blue uh these blue water tanks i always associate them with brazil or did brazil have black water tanks oh i'm not sure brazil might have had black water tanks oh oh i might be mixing up my water tanks oh we'll see i guess you can often use water tanks to help with your country uh search i've never heard of tachira there's no chance i'm finding the cheetah in the last few seconds uh it was i was venezuela and tachira wasn't even a city san cristobal well i don't know what kind of water tanks this venezuela used so no chance i would have gotten that and the cheetah wasn't even a city so so no chance i could have gotten that uh the the first two rounds were so good and then it all all is downhill from there this is official coverage dolla zimza five minutes is there a domain name somewhere rhoda we don't have an antenna i'm loving it zlata we don't have the blue strips i'm thinking maybe i actually no no hotel ambassador panda all or nothing i'm thinking like the language i don't know about the language but it feels kind of slovenian [Music] it's not slovenia serbia but i feel like in serbia i would see some cyrillic at least but with no antenna and this d letter i think it has to be serbia you know oh we can see some cyrillic yes yes yes hotel ambassador do we see hotel ambassador somewhere new city hotel america hotel ambassador ambassador here here here here somewhere here oh my god what is it right oh let's go oh oh my god that was the clutch oh my god that ambassador helped me so much there oh my god okay okay the last round ending on a high note another 5k so in total pretty good again let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges on the right side you will find another geographer play along video and huge thanks to all of the patreons and youtube members for supporting the channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ",

going to play a new map called a bingo world which contains some funny interesting and weird locations all of the play-along links will be in the description just make sure to play them before watching this video so don't spoil anything so let's have it no moving time and limit 1 minute 30 seconds and here we go all of these locations are taken from the geo bingo game which is made by soren i'll leave a link in the description as well which is a fun game they will contain some weird and uninteresting locations so this is a ufo exhibition apparently interesting looking can we find any languages uh nearby and as you can see this coverage might be official might be unofficial as in this case so who is the author the author's name sounds kind of spanish maybe but the texts in the museum are in english we have a big u.s flag apparently could this be like like some alien exhibition near the area 51 maybe i know no that i know area 51 is kind of kind of thought of as maybe an alien um inhabited space so maybe this is like an alien museum nearby i actually don't know exactly where is area 51 it's in arizona i think i think i'm gonna go somewhere near phoenix oh we ran out of time okay it was in new mexico well this museum at least this was international ufo museum and research center i guess okay interesting interesting in the middle of rock swell oh this is cute oh my god this is adorable i think i've seen this location before i don't remember where it was though passengers should take care when crossing the gangway we have a lot of pandas here adorable oh and we have some english and some chinese a mandarin chinese appears i am thinking maybe hong kong possibly either hong kong or taiwan maybe oh man this is adorable this is just adorable um let's go okay let's go i think i think let's go hong kong i don't think we're having we'll be having anything pinpointable here maybe somewhere near water somewhere somewhere here let's go okay it was hong kong okay it makes sense it was like like that some like a transport transport ship or for tourists to cross the cross the canal not bad okay i'm happy i recognized hong kong that's good already what okay this is scary this is scary and this is official coverage as well oh my god okay do we have language uh it's the quality is so poor i cannot read the language this is official though so i'm thinking maybe maybe the us why is this an official coverage why would google make an official coverage of like like some scary spooky scary house um maybe philippines we have a lot of palm trees here so either it's maybe somewhere southern us i'm thinking maybe asia somewhere some some asian country i'm kind of kind of being drawn to the philippines but but i really don't know let's go manila it was hong kong again interesting so very interesting locations in uh in hong kong apparently okay this is unofficial again a bunch of ladies standing around the camera and dancing i guess um since this is unofficial we cannot trust the sun this is a very beautiful meadow with these these flowers i don't think it gives us anything away we have a car there in the distance which i don't know would be nice if we could see which side the steering wheel is on but the quality is just too too low well all of the ladies in this photosphere are asian so i'm thinking we might be somewhere in asia possibly but where maybe maybe japan i could see maybe this meadow being in japan somewhere because it does does appear to be a little bit hilly landscape around so so i could definitely see this being japan in my opinion oh wow oh it was russia interesting interesting wow okay russia makes sense as well with like a meadow like that very north toy soldiers parachute drop okay some sort of a theme park and this is official again port mary paratroopers so this this seems very american to me but the fort mary might be somewhere else besides the like the mainland u.s maybe woody and and i don't know what was her name this isn't disneyland is it another is a disneyland in florida right i i guess i might as well go there because i don't have a better guess but the trees don't the trees feel more northern the trees don't don't feel like it's florida no okay i'm not gonna go florida i'm gonna go something like um chicago detroit let's go maybe minneapolis oh it was french disneyland oh my god it was all in english it was disneyland but it wasn't in the us it was france oh my god i've even been there i've even been in that disneyland but i i i did not remember that part not the greatest score only eleven thousand points that last round and the russian rounds did the most damage to me let's go for another game hopefully i do better in this one oh okay i know there is such a gnome in in a rotterdam but this is a second one and i think this one was in uh near in norway near oslo i think let's have a look if this is norway uh norge i'm pretty sure this is norway maybe somewhere drop maybe it was drama possibly do we have do we have a round about like like this in near drama maybe this one yeah i think i'll go here but uh oh it was just oslo okay for some reason i thought it might have been drama that was just just an oslo look like a santa sculpture next oh another scary location bergeron stone i've never actually oh no i'm lying i have been to one scary house before in london like near the l near the london eye there is at least was i don't know if it still is there but there was like a scary house um it wasn't that scary probably because i knew that they are all actors it is kind of creepy that's for what is this guy doing i would definitely go the us here but uh wait is that might be the u.s flag maybe or is that a state flag i think i see some red red white and blue there looking at the the nature and trees i have no idea i'm not the best with those let's go tennessee nashville why not kind of kind of in the middle middle eastern u.s oh wow it was very southern louisiana baton rouge is that how you say that place name baton rouge oh okay this is an interesting one a lot of lot of uh cows doggos as well are adorable a lot of cows and a lot of doggos oh this is is this romania maybe a kind of wintry coverage i'm thinking maybe maybe romania bulgaria somewhere there because i know those countries could have some some wintry coverage this is a pretty flat place pretty flat landscape so maybe i would go more romania because of that somewhere somewhere up here ish because because this this part of romania is quite mountainous and then then i think more here it gets kind of or down here it gets more flat let's actually go here because it could be bulgaria oh okay i was way off there interesting that we didn't see these mountains nearby wow okay so it was russia i mean makes sense these are not my best rounds but these are some tricky locations they don't really have good good clues i am enjoying these locations that's for sure so we have some indonesian license plates in indonesia you will get these front plates on motorcycles this is official coverage as well of course i didn't mention that we have a big apple and a big strawberry next to each other again some sort of a theme park it seems i know you can get similar palm trees in like thailand and cambodia but does that mean that we are near thailand and cambodia i wouldn't guess somewhere up here to be honest i wanted to guess java island a bang bandung or something i think i'll just go bandung okay it was java island i chose the right island but the wrong side it was quite quite eastern okay now we're in the restaurant on official coverage again 360 anziest otto kafa the author's name seems to be german let's see if we have some german yeah [Music] yeah do you have german donkey we could be in austria germany switzerland yeah i don't i don't see anything that that um would narrow it down between those countries i'd probably just go germany maybe kind of southern germany for hedging purposes like wurzburg or maybe stuttgart let's go stuttgart okay it was germany it was essen it was essen one of these cities here on the western side i'm pretty happy with my score here 16 800 points better than the first game that's for sure the worst round for me this time was the romanian the russian one where i went with romania that was a tricky one if we had had like a license plate or something then then that would have helped with russia action we have some german again apparently i think they they don't use this i think it's called estet letter correct me if i'm wrong in the comments please um this letter i don't think they use it in switzerland right i think they they use two s's instead of this letter so i don't think this would be switzerland we have a bunch of wallets doesn't help though but cool looking i'm thinking maybe i i'll go germany again i mean it could be could be austria as well i guess i'm looking for like domain names or something that could help so yeah let's go let's go let's go nurenberg maybe or frank let's go frankfurt maybe this time okay it was germany very northern very close to hamburg in the city called stade pretty good start i would say oh what is this oh this is cool this is like like a table top table top and bookstore oh this is cool i like this this looks like a place i would thoroughly enjoy in my spare time to be honest i love tabletop games and i love interesting books okay what is this language okay i do not know what language that is the author's name is agencia capture doesn't help deck building game well that's in english that's in english that's in english okay the tabletop games are in english but that doesn't help much american i think it says american games or something economics american economic studies wait what war games military militaria is is desperate it sounds kind of italian maybe kind of thinking it might be italy i'm running out of time uh rome would this be rome i don't know i think i'll go rome since it's also kind of in the middle of italy oh it wasn't okay apparently it wasn't italian it might have been catalan language since it was in barcelona new begin by the sea town council what what's what's so special and interesting in this location no that looks just weird walking your kid with a leash that i don't know feels weird new begin by the sea so we might be by the sea well of course we're in the uk we're doing left side yellow back plates on the cars in ireland there would be white back plates new begin new begin well we have to be in a place called new beginning there's so many so many things saying new big new beginning all around ashington bedlington north seton a197 can we maybe find that a197 oh we are running out of time let's get maybe somewhere here oh wow it was way north way more north than i thought okay oh new begin by the sea that's the whole name of the town new begin by the sea that's a long name for for a place i was thinking it would be somewhere down here [Music] okay that's a big bull and a big lumberjack i guess we have a u.s flag i do not know what state that flag belongs to one of the many states which look the same with with the blue background and something in the middle bemidji is this guy's name bemidji i don't know paul bunyan i i think i've heard that the name bunyan why have i heard the name bunyan i'm guessing he might it might have been like a famous famous guy babe wasn't the babe a pig i think in the movie maybe this was a different babe anyways uh lumberjack smack do we have front plates can we tell i can't really tell if we have front plates if i knew this license plate that would be super helpful but i do not know um american license plates unfortunately we're running out of time i would go maybe somewhere like louisiana or texas or maybe okay let's go mississippi oh wow it was way more north than i thought oh no this is a bad round this is a battle this is a difficult map honestly i am struggling here i was very happy with my previous round a previous game score oh that's a big doggo with a bone okay some sort of sculpture park it seems it's like a horse with a pumpkin carriage is this like the the pinocchio oh yeah there is pinocchio and i i forgot what was his name we have the snow white here as well okay the landscape and then the houses feel kind of maybe north macedonia vibes do we have an antenna on the google car no and we also don't have the blue strip on the cars so i think north macedonia is a really good shot for those reasons and in general we have a mosque here it seems and you can't get you can see some mosques in north macedonia for four north macedonia can be quite hilly um so i think north macedonia would be a great shout here let's go like near velez maybe it's somewhere again in the middle because i don't really know i have a better clue okay i was way off again oh my god oh my god i was pretty sure it would be north because in turkey also usually see the blue strips interesting wow okay that one that one really tricked me there thirteen thousand six hundred points a some of these zones were very far away but let me know in the comments how you did if you managed to beat me and on the right side there will be another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members

to play along will be in the description and if you want to play it from above like i will be doing i will leave an info card up there on how to add the satellite view script okay let's begin let's begin so let's do 10 minute time limit with moving around if you if you want to play it like a regular challenge without looking from above you can do that as well but but i will be playing it from above to make it a little bit different let's have a look so it looks like uh a lot of similarly colored roofs which would make me think maybe something like uh with kind of like grayish-looking roofs maybe like like like belgium germany something like that which said are we driving on here can we tell it might still be uk if we're driving the left side for example okay looking at these road lines i think we are driving the left side it was really difficult to tell because the quality isn't the best but yeah i think we are driving the left side here because because of these arrows on the left side of this road so i am thinking now uk or ireland these kind of houses you see a lot in ireland can light houses with gray roofs but you can sometimes see them in the uk too so it's not like a guaranteed thing we have a small river we have some some kind of lakes a very round looking lake i think maybe looking in ireland first because we do see a lot of these kind of light houses with grey roofs here i think i'm gonna try to look for like this kind of circular lake in ireland this looks like a relatively large city i can't find anything in ireland let's try maybe uk i don't think it would be scotland though so let's begin maybe from from the south and move move up from there the city i was looking at the city looks kind of kind of pretty stretched out kind of vertically so i'm looking for kind of kind of vertical cities if that makes sense wait it is oxford oh okay okay it was oxford it is kind of stretched out and i noticed this uh this this oxford sailing club in this kind of farmware reservoir okay let's go let's go so we are in oxford there is this long road going through so we're looking for this kind of kind of lakey thingy okay we are looking so near railroads we have this river this river and we are i think somewhere here oxford ice race ice skating rink this is okay so we are right next to the ice skating rink it seems here-ish i think and we have this river right to our east let's go good start good start next round hopefully nothing too difficult okay this is a huge city oh my god so this shouldn't be too difficult i hope because it really looks enormous we can't even see the whole city in in our sight and we have a big river our east i'm thinking somewhere maybe north america from the first glance but let's explore a little bit more i'm not so sure just yet we have a big park here it's not new york though the central park in new york looks different maybe it's a different park in new york i don't know about that let's let's have a look we should be driving to our on our right side right yeah we are driving the right side these huge huge roads and intersections very american you don't really see usually huge intersections like that in europe u.s loves their stadiums right but but the only stadiums that i see are either without any writings or or covered no no team names i don't think this time sometimes you can see some us team names like chicago bulls or something i don't know i have a baseball field as well yeah i tried to look for some some things that i might maybe recognize or some text but couldn't find any well new york has some rivers going through but i don't think does it maybe new jersey somewhere down here could it be it is kind of similar we have some water here some water or east but it just just looks different i'm still thinking it might be somewhere in this area possibly but boston boston boston no no no no no could it be canada we're back no i was thinking it should be coastal no well none of these none of these cities are big enough toronto no we don't have a river oh ottawa no monreal oh maybe maybe it is monreal yes we have these islands we have these islands here okay i was thinking it would be much closer to like uh like a ocean i felt like this river enters ocean here but my assumption was wrong apparently in this park basically this this right yes we are uh so this tiny lake here we are near the parking lot it feels kind of weird to me that there are kind of car roads going through a park but i guess if you have such a huge park it makes sense we are kind of kind of right right uh across the what is that pdq pdq police department we're back let's go here nice okay two meters good good good good good let's move on okay again a pretty big big looking city not not as big as monreal in the previous round okay and we have a lot of red roofs which kind of makes me think maybe europe also another thing that is the roads don't go like parallel to each other in europe the roads often will go all the way all the way the shadows are going to the north so we should be in the northern hemisphere we are driving on the right side here so all points that it might be europe also kind of these a lot of these houses kind of look kind of older older fashioned historical buildings and you get a lot of those in europe as well just from the vibes i was thinking with these red roofs maybe something like italy or portugal spain something like that maybe but i would love to find some some extra clues we have an airport here with a pretty big runway is there any water maybe that could there is no water really just some small very small rivers between the mountains it is mountainous so that's that's a clue in itself in portugal i feel you wouldn't get a city with mountains to your left such a big city i mean because the biggest cities in portugal are kind of coastal with cold with water to our water are like not the mountains so i'm kind of starting to lean more towards italy maybe somewhere up here trendo has a river going through there that doesn't fit i'm thinking it could be maybe somewhere up here i could not find it unfortunately in time i hope it's italy at least it was ah it was france actually towards the end i was looking at some some bigger cities in france okay it was a little bit smaller than i had imagined even if i had zoomed in on this from this distance the airport doesn't even show up so i i might have even glanced it over if i had looked at it so that was a tricky oh god what is this what is this now what so we are on on like an island on the very coast my first thought is like like uh florida.texas where they have these kind of kind of islands with this shoreline the quality is so bad we can't even we can barely even see anything here we have this kind of sort of something i don't know what it is even looking at a man-built island i guess looking at these houses with many different roofs um i'm not thinking the us definitely and also i think in us the quality would be definitely better but also a very big city though we have some some city continuing here these these type of houses give me african vibes i would say look um sandy roads colorful roofs maybe south america i could see that where's the sun the sun is a little bit to our south so we should be in the northern hemisphere with coastal south maybe ghana nigeria maybe that would be my best guess at this point i think there really isn't much we can explore with this sort of quality unfortunately so we might as well go and try to find it i guess so ghana or nigeria let's start with ghana so i don't see anything like that in ghana here in [Laughter] water oh that's that's a good good good name for the for the place more water oh we have a lot of water here in ghana a lot of water water lakes these cities are too small these places are too small for it to fit in ghana okay let's have a look at lagos the horizontal line fits very or could we be here maybe oh wait we have these are these this these might be the same these thingies okay the big clue could be this thing if we can find something the shape okay the shape of the island is a bit different but the road fits perfectly so i think it has to be that i'm pretty sure it is lagos at this point um so we are how are we going to pinpoint this it isn't a roundabout really but they might have might have did some reconstruction work on that road possibly i think we are on this road here street street is it street z street z original name i'll give you that street r and street z intersection so let's go okay we were on street z good job round number five now okay okay much better quality very um gritty city which which makes me think us maybe somewhere southern us looking like a very dry and dry and deserty let's have a look let's have a look what is this we have t how how do you pronounce it tucson tucson toxon oh god i'm sorry but there was a city right uh in in what was the state arizona i was looking at texas at first but that's why i usually look at these stadiums and then the stuff sometimes you get lucky and you get like city name or a team name so we should be in tucson maybe you should stop pronouncing that the city name because i might be mispronouncing it badly we have this big road here yeah yeah yeah that is that road we should be somewhere here ish usa magnet school high magnet school what well that's an interesting name high magnet school i guess that school is very attractive we are on the east sixth street the triangle ends we have this intersection oh what is the yeah this this house very interesting looking house with this unique roof we have it right here so we are in on north arizona avenue let's go let's go good job how did we do in total i um fumbled mumbled one of the rounds which was the french one yeah that was a tricky one i was sort of in the right area but but didn't explore france uh far enough but still 23 000 points let's go for another game let's go let's go another challenge the link will be again in the description okay another pretty big city not too big though and we have some like a river going through which could prove to be helpful we're getting a lot of northern hemisphere countries today some some skyscrapers driving on the right side it seems yes with these kind of roofs reddish roofs again i would say europe i'm really not sure which country here this time though my first thought was maybe something like slovakia techia somewhere in that area possibly well maybe i should just look for some some some cities in that area in that area that have a river going through and the reddish houses would would make me think kind of like in this this kind of area maybe i checked out czechia slovakia hungary part of germany i think maybe it could be could be germany as well or poland i don't know if augsburg even has official coverage um stood got we we do have river we have river going to our east stuttgart kind of fits maybe okay okay yeah i think we have these these these kind of curves on the river really fit perfectly well here we okay we we have this curve in railroad tracks we are kind of below the curve where were these railroad tracks and [Music] we are somewhere like year-ish then we have this kind of alleyway looking thing and we are right here i believe okay okay good let's go and what is this round number two oh this looks like a small city a city with in like mountains in the gray roofs again i'm thinking somewhere switzerland maybe or somewhere in that area we are driving the right side here on andorra maybe andorra has this very stretched out uh city layout right we have like one big road going through yes yeah yeah yeah with the lots of roundabouts this has to be on dora i'm pretty sure andorra has a lot of roundabouts very stretched out city from west to east and with mountains all over the place mandar is such a cool country to be honest i would love to visit it one one of many countries that i would love to visit we are so we have this road with roundabouts to our south so following the river somewhere on this road right i think so yeah this road goes in three ways we are on the eastern side of the river somewhere here i would say okay this was an easy one this is a big and kind of bright white city with look in the white roofs and a lot of rivers of course yeah as you can see for the canals this is a very big one for sure as you can tell but but but let's zoom in i'm thinking sort of north america again possibly although with these kind of colorful roofs maybe not north america we have a football stadium we have are those also smaller football stadiums i don't think you will get would get so many football stadiums in the us would you another possibly football stadium another football theme and a baseball stay a baseball field wherever this is they have a lot of football stadiums and baseball fields so north which side are we driving on could this ever be would this area be something like japan we are driving the left side yeah we are doing the left side i know japan really likes baseball from what i've heard so i'm thinking this could be maybe japan i don't know if japan really likes football not sure about that but but baseball fields would explain it don't think this is tokyo i think tokyo looks different i mean we still can check it of course but but with watered our south i would guess yeah kind of get the southern coast of japan let's let's have a look at some of these cities and see which one might fit i saw some similar ports but nothing that fits perfectly though oh my god we are here how did i miss hiroshima what i was looking all over the place how did i miss hiroshima it fits perfectly this bridge goes there somewhere yeah we have this park to our west i think we should be there okay good six meters good good good okay i like to get bigger cities like this though so they're easier to find um again this is this has to be europe red and black roofs sun shadows going to the north we have this sort of a big cathedral which maybe i should know but but as you know i'm not good with famous places unfortunately we have a very interesting looking football field with some some dashes and stuff i'm thinking maybe germany again or germany would be my main guess but what else could it be somewhere in that area we do have a river why could this be belgium i remember belgium had like something like similar to this it is why can i never recognize belgium i've had it so numerous times oh i remember this thingy from a different video i'll leave it up there in info card we are not too far from that here is that bridge we are to the east i think we are like here ish with some trees i think we are like there okay nice nice and the last round of this game we have a river river river again red rose i don't think we've we've had any round in the southern hemisphere in these two games the sun is again into our south so we are in again in the northern hemisphere i don't know these kind of multi-colored roofs would make me think maybe um asia let's have a look which shadow we're driving on here the quality isn't the best but i think we are driving on the left side here i think this could be thailand with all of these multicolored roofs and driving on the left side so you know in thailand you can get a lot of blue and red and different different roofs i don't think it will be bangkok though if it is even thailand that is it might not even be maybe this could be something like indonesia or something malaysia well let let's look for the river right this kind of almost looks like a w here a w river we're looking for thailand doesn't really have many other like big cities like this uh besides bangkok right most most of these cities in this area are coastal this one isn't coastal so i'm thinking either malaysia or indonesia again most cities there are coastal maybe perak and the biggest biggest thing i feel is here is that that w looking river so if i can find okay just as i said okay okay so here is the www river what is that merb river merbuch river okay this city is smaller than i expected it to be but okay that that works so i guess the the coast is right out of our sight we are on one of these roads here one of these long roads that go all through so we are on the left long road this is the right long road this is the left long road that goes all the way through here they have laurent 24 there i think we are close to this intersection yes yes okay nine meters okay this game was better because i found all of the places i hope you did well as well don't forget to press that like button if you enjoy these videos and on the right side you will find another satellite view video where you can play along huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one

previous videos i'm not sure even if there are i probably won't remember knowing my memory i think i might recognize this bridge actually i i don't know many famous places or maybe not wait wait is is this is this the one in oh this is okay this is the golden gate bridge i actually was thinking this is the one in lisbon in portugal there is a similar bridge in portugal here i thought it's this one but then i also noticed alcatraz we have alcatraz here the the infamous prison would be cool to visit it is open to visitors nowadays right it's no longer a prison i think but yeah this is of course the golden gate bridge very famous landmark so let's uh let's go and guess it i i don't think i'll be able to to recognize many places like this so i'm very happy that i did at least one as my viewers know i'm not very good with famous places i think we should be somewhere maybe a little bit more south somewhere here okay a little bit more south okay i was hundred meters away but still it was five five thousand points which is very good okay let's go for the next round what do we have here okay some somewhere very built up we have a big river going here let's zoom in what's the famous place okay some sort of a cathedral okay well i'm thinking it looks very european right um with with houses like these where though where though wait could this be london it kind of reminds me of river thames and i think that this might be a hyde park i know there are some parks in this area in london i think this might be london can we find big ben or something oh this is the london eye yeah yeah yeah we have london eye here so this is london actually okay i don't know what's the oh is that the the saint paul's cathedral let's have a look let's have a look i think so i mean we must be driving the left side right yeah yeah we are of course let's check out if that is the saint paul's cathedral i did not recognize it from above okay we have this this kind of kind of [Music] oh my god i sometimes forget the english words curve that's the word curve we have this curve and we should be above one of these this bridge which bridge is this is is it yeah i think it's this one millennium bridge and it is saint paul's cathedral i've actually been there i've been there it was many years ago but but i really like london it's one of my favorite cities to visit okay let's guess okay good guess six meters let's move on okay well we have a big river going here the city looks big as well what is this famous place now it looks like some sort of a tower here like some sort of archway what could this be we have a stadium here at the the southern part of the city let's let's let's have a look where is the sun we have a lot of railways railroads here which set are we driving on can we tell that the image quality is not very good i'm getting kind of asian vibes maybe with all of these these cars going all over the place i think it might be something like india maybe which side are we driving on i really wanna know oh we have a bigger road it does appear that we are driving on the left side i think well the biggest clue here i think is that river and the city is huge huge city because all of these tiny tiny dots are houses so i think india is my main guess here let's have a look new delhi maybe is there a river going through like there is a river going through does it match we have this big curve here yes yes it is okay i'm i'm on fire today i don't think in my previous famous place videos i was doing that well but let's hope let's hope i don't jinx it um this oh india gates india gate okay i'll be leaving pictures of these places on screen so you know how they look in real life so i know as well how they look in real life really interesting place so we are right in the middle of this intersection here canopy okay interesting okay let's go let's go okay this looks way more green way less built up than new delhi what is the famous place oh ah could it be something like chichen itza maybe you know chichen itza has these kind of stair looking things the sun is to our south yeah that would work i think chichen itza is a good shout i don't know is there a city near chichen itza like this again the quality is not the greatest but it i think we are drawing the right side here looking at the houses from above might be mexico i can't really tell we have this this round thing is this for bullfighting i know in spain you get those kind of circular stadiums for bullfighting i don't know if it's a thing in mexico as well but okay let's try to find chichen itza on the map and see if the place is align where was it though oh i could never find chichen itza oh okay this time i found it somehow immediately um it i i think it aligns no yeah yeah yeah we have this big big big big curve i don't know why i can't remember the word curve today how do we pinpoint this oh yeah well it was easier to pinpoint than i thought we just look for this look for this so i think we're somewhere around this area let's go nine meters away i'm on fire today i'm super excited about that oh wait oh i thought i thought this was india again but no no it looks a little bit different wait wait is this this is india this is new delhi again it is at first i thought it was then i thought it wasn't but i noticed this stadium again i noticed this gate of india right we were here before let's go okay where are we this time oh like a like a lotus flower really cool looking place new delhi is so humongous it's insane in the previous location we couldn't even see all of this area and oh my dear lord how huge it is it's insane i've never been to india but i would love to go experience all the culture the foods i'm a big big food lover anyways the lo like a lotus flower near the river okay let's try to find it here is that river lotus temple lotus temple i think it has to be right we have these small pools here yeah okay perfect perfect lotus temple and nine meters okay perfect score i'm very happy about that and it was very quick as well let me know in the comments how you are doing in these games if you play along and don't forget to press that like button if you enjoy these satellite view videos so i know to make more of them what is this something coastal you you know i like coastal locations in these satellite view games i hate coastal locations in regular g i guess or in satellite view give me more somewhere pretty hilly it seems pretty hilly coast my first thought is europe because of these red roofs maybe something like italy you know italy or portugal maybe maybe portugal actually with the coast to the left side i mean both italy and portugal could have it but these these super red roofs so the famous place itself is the bridge here i do not recognize the bridge it's hard to tell from above but i think the architecture might be a little bit more portuguese but don't quote me on that and the sun is to our south so we are in the northern hemisphere we are driving on the right side of the road so no surprise is there some some beach in the middle of oh my bigger construction site maybe i guess it is yeah okay i think i see some some equipment here i didn't find any any any any helpful stadiums or any anything that that would uh really pinpoint me one way or another so let's start with portugal maybe i'm thinking maybe this could be portal because i know it's not lisbon lisbon looks different from uh from above so i was thinking maybe porto porto is also a big coastal city it it is i'm just too good i don't know what's happening with me today because usually i'm not that good in these these famous place what is that bridge i don't even know what that bridge is i just recognize the city ponte lui one iconic metal bridge okay so we are on there okay four meters away great start oh wow mountains i really like that these mountains if you zoom in you can really tell it really feels that they are in your face if you look around i do not know what this is where's the famous place oh some sort of uh like a like a castle some sort of a castle on the mountainside this isn't neuschwanstein is it i don't know no i don't i don't think it is what we have here we have some sort of like a bay or something which which might be crucial to pinpointing this let's have a look at the house it definitely feels european again with these red roofs yeah the cars i'm pretty sure are driving on the right side here yeah again no surprises which european country could this be can we find any any other clues yeah i feel like this is the first one actually really tricky one that i've had today i'm looking again for some stadiums or something that could maybe help me uh with some texts but the only stadium i see is like this football field and that doesn't really help well probably because this city doesn't appear to be very large but i'm getting maybe kind of germany austria vibes here somewhere in that area where would we have like this bay i don't know it might be a lake let's let's have a look around here do we see anything like that in this area i know neuschwanstein is somewhere down here but uh yeah i don't think i don't think there is like a lake like that nearby this one was the closest one that i've found yet but it's still not it i've been trying to find this this lake but i think is like all around like europe this area but i don't think i'll be able to find it wait no oh are you serious how did no way okay i found it i was 100 was it actually neuschwanstein seriously no way i didn't think there were lakes near neuschwanstein apparently there are i was like hundred percent sure there's there's no chance i'm finding it okay six meters away let's go okay this again big river here oh wait is this oh it is isn't it yeah it is the washington dc this is the washington monument the lincoln sits here we've had this island and another satellite view videos before i remember that one so we are um i'm not sure what this building is that white house from above i'm not sure if that's white house from above or or it is the white house actually okay i thought it looks different from above learning something new every day uh so we're basically in the middle here let's go four meters oh this is uh again europe very red um roofs we have a bridge i have a feeling we've had this bridge before but i don't remember where i don't remember which european country it was um that's not good we have some stadiums here what does it say rcf fear fee and tina something and tina well this is not argentina is it no no no this is not argentina looking like this so we have a small river we have a small river going through with some stadiums nearby why did something like north macedonia or let's have a look could it be skopje skopje does have a river going through but but it's way more wiggly doesn't it's not going to be belgrade it's not belgrade novi sod no there was some sort of a historical bridge wait was it italy was it italy i think it was i think i remember i would spend like 10 minutes looking all around here but it turned out to be like was it florence oh my god i think it was oh because last name i remember that i did not find this i could not find this yes yes is this one so okay we have this thingy here and one two three third bridge from that thingy so one two this is the one ponte vecchio medieval stone bridge yeah that was the one that was the one okay two meters let's go can i get another perfect score i i believe i believe we are in a small island here wait is it i think i can't get a perfect score here okay that is the statue of liberty let's go let's go is it just me or did we actually get like pretty easy rounds in this video i kind of felt that way in the previous famous place videos i really struggled way more let's go let's go another perfect score let me know how you did in the comments below and on the right side you will find another video where you can play along some famous places from above huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be kind

which contains a bunch of different tips from all around the world and i'll be explaining them as we go quickly before we start don't forget to press that like button it really supports the channel and lets me know that you enjoy these videos thank you very much and here we go if you want to play along the links will be in the description just make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything and you can play it for free you don't need to have a geographer pro account or anything here we go what do we have here we have this kind of small car visible this is a meta tip not all of these tips will be met related i know some people really don't like meta tips but this one is a meta one so we have these kind of google car almost all is blurred with the circular blur but a little bit of google car is coming out there these corners you get this google car in uganda uganda in national parks uganda national parks are difficult to tell apart i think this might be one of these ones on the left side here let's maybe go around this area okay it was was more south it was this one national park but yeah most of these tips will be kind of country based that will help you get the country not necessarily the area some of these tips will be also area based here we have these long long yellow lines very long yellow lines who are very close to each other you can see that in norway also these yellow yellow signs with black kind of arrows here you can also find them in norway and of course the beautiful landscapes with mountains all around also very norwegian here we have road 800 and also the trees here not very big very small trees i believe road 800 was somewhere very north wasn't it let's have a look i might be misremembering something 80s 80s are up here 83 800 might be somewhere near 80s because it starts with an eight yeah 90s are all the way up here so i think eight eights might be somewhere here if we had more time maybe we could try to find these cities it was kind of in this area okay here we have generation four camera with an antenna you can get that in a couple of countries some of them being like bulgaria hungary maybe it looks like in the distance we have these kinda holy poles with these holes in the distance you can get holy poles in a couple of countries for example poland hungary romania and also i think you can get this car in romania i don't think you can get it in poland let's have a look what else do we see here not much we don't see any of these signs but because of this car and that holy pole in the distance in particular i would go with hungary here so let's guess hungary and see if that is right it is right indeed next round what do we get so what we have here is australia we have these bollards that you see in australia these white white bowlers with this small red reflector on them those are typical australian bollards also generation 2 camera with this circle around us and in the sky as well but the tip here that you might not know about is the overcast meta as we call it if you see these very cloudy skies in australia in particular that is a good clue that you might be somewhere in victoria the state of victoria and the southern part of it west or east of melbourne i would i would maybe guess kind of west of melbourne here we'll see if that's right or not okay it was kind of in the right area so if you see these kind of cloudy skies good chance you might be there not guaranteed of course we have these stop signs which appear to be spanish these look like a spanish stop signs also we get waffle poles we call these waffle poles because because they are not fully with holes they're not holy poles holy poles you can see through them waffle poles have these kind of kind of closed gaps this is also a spanish sign with no white borders around and this is also a spanish like a down down sign here we have also some signs uh cm [Music] cm roads i do not remember if cm roads were something special or not they appear to be very small since this number is very very big i don't think we have a good chance to find that but we know the country for sure we know the country for sure here so let's guess kind of maybe in the middle-ish was a little bit more southeast let's be in total in total a pretty good score i would say almost 23 000 let's go for another game and see what tips do we get this time what we get here is that i can see some european style plates with the blue on the left side and some yellow plates as well with some blue on the left side which makes me think this might be france in france you can get both white plates and a bunch of yellow plates as well which are like older ones looking here at these signs yup it does look like it the language is french and we have generation 2 camera with this wide circular blur around us both on the ground and in the sky with all of these steps i am thinking this might be kind of uh maybe coarse generally older cars will have these yellow plates and since we have so many of them i am thinking it might be coarse let's have a look it was okay wrong city but but general thought process was right next what we have here these houses with very pointy kind of these pointy tips on the roofs very pointy you get these houses in particular western west sumatra also of course we get got an indonesian flag there are a bunch of country clues a bunch of flags we get some yellow plates some black plates with three white sections these are indonesian plates with the black plates with three white sections here in malaysia they get two white sections but the biggest clue here yeah this particular roof you get these roofs quite often in west sumatra in particular so let's guess somewhere there ish let's go next location here what we have zoom in on the language language feels italian so it looks very italian right again generation two camera if if you play with meta if you don't you can just ignore these meta tips just focus on the non-meta ones these bollards these bollards you get in both italy and san marino telling italy and san marino apart can be tricky when you look at the license plates these do not seem like the usual italian license plates because in italy most of the license plates will have blue on the ball on both sides here these license plates do not have blue on both sides also this one in the distance doesn't so i'm starting to think when we see couple of those license plates it might not be italy it might be san marino also san marino will be mountainous italy can be mountainous too but if it wouldn't be mountainous then we wouldn't even consider san marino basically since it's mountainous since these plates don't have blue strips that's why i'm thinking san marino here basically and generation two as well san marino will have generation two camera let's make a guess and it is san marino let's go round number four okay well this is an easy one this is an easy one just to check if you if you recognize the city names we have krakov rotslav katovitza well those are big polish cities also this bollard polish bollard good to know as well i'm a big bollard fan because in rural locations they often come in handy when there are no signs nothing else often times there will be some pollards so you can really use them if you if you if you know them krakow wrote they are generally more kind of southern yeah a7s 8 is s8 is here s7 is here maybe we are somewhere here where the s7 and s8 meets somewhere here yeah somewhere in that area oh this is an interesting car this is a very interesting car again very meta meta heavy location you get this google car in kenya this is a kenyan google car you don't get it often you get it in like a national park i don't remember which national park unfortunately it was a national park but which one was it let's have a look which one was it it was oh it was here it was this one but i did remember it was kenya at least let's have a look in total 23.8 000 points not too bad and let's go for another game since these games are quicker than the usual ones let's go for another one when we hear generation 4 camera driving on the right side we have this solid yellow line in the middle you can get solid yellow lines in both countries but i feel they are a little bit more common in canada also these signs i feel like i've seen them more commonly in canada as well this kind of kind of real estate for sale signs it's gonna red white blue ones oh we we have this blue street sign again you can get blue street signs in the u.s but i feel like they're a little bit more common in canada so just all of these small clues none of these clues are like 100 on their own but the more you see of them together the more confident i would be with guessing canada here not sure about the city might be toronto maybe let's go somewhere there okay got the completely wrong city but if i was playing country streaks this is perfectly fine if anyone maybe knows how i would have known it was vancouver let me know but but that tip was purely unrecognized in the country i don't think there was anything city specific that i i know at least here we are driving the left side with these white plates immediately thinking uh ireland right also in europe only in ireland you will get these rectangular yellow signs you usually get these the style of signs in american countries but in europe only ireland will get these these rectangular yellow signs and of course we see english around as well so that's that's a clue in itself too so i would go ireland here okay it was a little bit more north next location here first thing that i notice is all of these small blurs i have talked about this before but in lithuania you will often get these kind of small blurs all around you can see like here here here here here here all over the place are these small tiny blurs that you notice so that in itself is a good clue that this would be lithuania because everything the most random things are blurred in lithuania you do get three stripes so it kind of verifies it might be there are many other countries where you get three stripes on pedestrian crossing signs lithuania is one of them so let's get somewhere this time it was clapadam fourth location here we have let's zoom in the distance we see this license plate this license plate with kind of a black dot in the middle is uh argentinian argentinian license plate you will see that in argentina also these are trash baskets you see in southern america quite common if you see some trash baskets you won't see them in europe so that kind of gives the continent away immediately yeah i think the biggest clues here is the black google car if you use meta if you don't then the the license plate the license plate is the argentinian one that one pays to know and the last round here first of all language language language language this is a mere language i believe that they use in cambodia with very squiggly similar to thai but more squiggly if that makes sense also in thailand we would be driving on the left side here we are driving on the right side this google car with kind of kind of these these stripes visible this tiny tiny antenna you can also see that in cambodia also in cambodia you will sometimes see these waffle poles kind of similar to the ones we had in spain before and also in cambodia sometimes we will see cambodia beer well it kind of gives it away since it's called cambodia sometimes you will get encore beer gonna like encore wat the famous place laos will be also driving the right side but the plates and loss will be yellow so that's how you can tell laws from cambodia apart let's go somewhere here-ish okay it was ju just the capital the summary the summary was not the greatest because we had some big countries where i didn't make the closest of guesses but as mentioned before many of these tips are country based that will help you to recognize the country and then you can go on from there in the description i'll leave some extra challenge links for you to practice in case you don't have a pro account and i'll also leave a link to my geographer tips playlist where i share even more and more useful tips for geogasser on the right side you will find another play along video where i share some useful tips huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful west everyday be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "images_path":

but if you're not a pro don't you worry you can still test your skills the play along links will be in the description as always make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything we'll be playing with one minute 30 and no moving good luck so i expect to see some weird and obscure locations in this map probably some some that you don't usually get well this is australia these are australian bullards we are driving in the left side indicated by the antenna all white lines i have seen snowy australia before but i don't remember which part it was i am thinking could it be somewhere like victoria maybe with this overcast weather you can see some cloudy weather in victoria nearby sometimes that would probably be my main guess would the nature fit not sure not sure i think it might okay i i don't see any other clues we might as well just guess i think i was tasmania there's many across my mind but i thought i thought i had seen those bullards in victoria before that's why i went there but okay not too bad not too bad almost 4 000 points in the first round what do we have next okay we have a very uh big bollard which reminds me of czech or slovakian one but this this yellow sign doesn't really um feel like that area and what do we have here boss doesn't help much even if it isn't checky or slovakia i it still reminds me of that area and with this bollard i think i'll go kind of northern czechia near poland because it's hilly there uh and then we have some some religious buildings here poland is very religious oh slovenia okay fair enough that was a weird bullard for slovenia but uh slovenia makes sense with that yellow sign well yeah these are kind of locations that i'm expecting from this map it's kind of kind of weird unusual but you wouldn't expect um oh god what is this now oh no oh no we have a slight google car visible here but i don't think it helps me much and by the way all of this is official coverage so you can trust compass and then it's all made by google the sun is basically directly above us i would say maybe something like malaysia indonesia somewhere in that area maybe i think i'll go mainland malaysia because i don't have a better guess this is a difficult one we're in the middle of a forest literally oh it was taiwan okay i was right about it being southeast asia but but but i just didn't know which country what should be my goal for my score i will be happy if in one of the games i get at least let's say 16 000 points that would be pretty good i think we have kind of a generation two in japan um driving the left side of course this feels um how does this feel this feels maybe a little bit more southern to me you know i i think i will go kind of southern japan here because just just by the vibes i don't i haven't seen any good clues that that would help me let's go something like kikioto osaka somewhere in this area okay was a bit more more northern than i thought but still a 3 800 uh points not too bad not too bad and the fifth round here okay this is kind of i think is it i think this could be either us or canada the signs feel more canadian the roadlines feel more like the u.s expos okay yeah we okay we have we have an american flag looking like this i would go north east of the us maybe that's that's what i am gathering here um maybe maybe maybe something like new york somewhere in this area was more west 2500 points how much did i get 15 000 in total okay let's go for the second game hopefully i can get to those 16 000 points i believe i can what do we have so we have a generation four camera with an antenna okay this little sign looks like the lithuanian one have they added gen 4 to lithuania as well i'm not sure what are the poles like the poles look like they might be lithuanian okay there are some signs in the distance i i think it's lithuanian on that sign this something eat this i think it's lithuania i had no idea and these are lithuanian poles as well wow i did not know that lithuania has generation 4 now learning something new every day that's cool hopefully latvia gets some generation 4 soon as well or maybe they have already that i don't know about but yeah this is a lithuanian sign kind of like um with 90 90 degrees like that like two two parts and then there's lithuanian text there oh i almost ran out of time oh my god okay i plonked it in latvia accidentally i was explaining explaining all the tips that i used that i ran out of time okay i flunked it in latvia but still 4 000 points i knew it was lithuania okay but uh let's move on interesting learning something new every day very close to the border we have yellow lines in the middle kind of like like a blurred out um car looks very interesting looks very interesting what do we have is this um okay i cannot tell what pole it is i'm getting latin american vibes here but uh where is the sun the sun appears to be kind of maybe a little bit to the north i am thinking kind of brazil maybe that i'm very much not sure colombia is crossing my mind as well this is a weird one whichever it is it's it looks very weird very unusual i think i'll go northern brazil maybe i i'm not sure okay it was brazil wasn't northern brazil didn't look like the usual brazil that uh that you usually get i don't think brazil is such a big country even though i got it right wrong part of the country and so many points lost there immediately very harsh we have diesel super ulp okay well english welcome to baladonia baladonia viking express melbourne okay melbourne perth now where would this be just because it says melbourne perth well melbourne perth are pretty far apart you know so uh it might be somewhere in between somewhere in between melbourne and we have a yellow plate which would make me think we might be in new south wales i do not know where baladonia is i've never heard of baladonia i think i'll go maybe near wagga wagga in new south wales and and hope for the best ah it was between melbourne and perth uh here was baladonia yeah um it is findable it is findable but but i feel like you need a bit more time to find it let's go for the next round we have the black google car and that's it that's all we get basically black google car i'm kind of getting south korea vibes maybe where in south korea could this be this be jeju in jeju you see some rock walls a jeju is this um island south of uh mainland south korea because of these rock walls i'm thinking it might be jeju that would also explain why it's such a such a weird coverage as well i think it should be south korea i i will go jeju let's have a look nice okay finally a good guess finally okay okay next round if i do well in this round i could get 16 000 which is my goal we have these balls that i'm not sure about okay this is kind of like a pretty wide blur what what is this these look like thai poles they look like thai poles i can't see the language there this is a very weird blur could this ever be sri lanka sri lanka also can have some similar poles to taiwan's i think i'll go sri lanka i think thai polls are a little bit different i think sri lankan falls gonna get a little bit more narrow in the top like these do so i'm going sri lanka and hoping for the best yes okay we did it we did 16 800 points that was intense let's go for the last one let's go for the third one let's see what score we get here but i have reached my goal i am very happy about it let me know in the comments how you enjoy this map and and if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button as well so so i know to make more of these we have this long antenna wait what is this this is like a super long antenna okay okay okay um someone went overboard with antennas here interesting where do i need such a super long antenna what is that phone number three is it three six four three six threes threes were somewhere in the middle right three six oh i don't remember i should refresh my my um rush on phone codes i think three sixes were somewhere year-ish i might be wrong though it might not even be three six might be three eight if it's three eight it's somewhere completely different now i think i'll keep it there and okay it was more east okay it was a little bit more east but i'm happy with my guess to be honest for russia thirty four hundred points that's a good start it was kind of northeast of novosibirsk okay the google car is not visible here okay this license plate looks kind of argentinian to me with this black dot in the middle there's a doggo in the distance of course um yeah another argentinian plate so we're definitely in argentina where in argentina could just be i am thinking it might be quite southern because i know southern chile looks something like similar to this so i'm thinking maybe this is kind of southern argentina near chile it is mountainous it looks similar to cheat mountainous chile something maybe somewhere in this area maybe even more south it might be too southern i might be going to southern here but but let's let's have a look oh okay i was way wrong i was very wrong my vibes are off with argentina unfortunately so so bad score there even though with the right country we have uh yellow lines in the middle generation four camera the sun should be to our well i was thinking south but the sun is the north um it just looks so much like the us or what else could this be brazil i mean brazil can have very red soil like this maybe this is brazil actually not the typical brazil but i could i could see this being brazil i'll trust sun this time let's go brazil maybe let's go somewhere in this area maybe okay not bad not bad actually really good guys i'm very happy with that um okay what do we have okay this is kind of a [Music] white blur very circular blur isn't really generation two because we don't have that blur in the sky that circular blur i'm thinking some sort of a national park national park in maybe uh uganda maybe kenya i'm thinking maybe that area these are some very interesting trees they might be unique to some particular area so okay let's have a look i'm gonna guess one of these these kind of nature reserves okay not bad it was actually uganda was a different nature reserve 4 500 points uh and last round last round in this game we have generation 4 camera with an antenna and driving on the left side of course residential something cleaning so english speaking is that a european plate there no these are not european place i think this has to be south africa right south africa recently received some generation 4 coverage as well with plates like these it's not going to be australia it's not going to be new zealand they don't have these white plates it has to be south africa is this the table table mountain tabletop mountain in cape town is it it kind of looks like it might be no so there is that table table mountain and it is kind of to our southeast so that would also fit right which direction is the road look diagonal maybe we're on this road somewhere the road direction would kind of fit maybe i mean we're not super close to coast so it's not going to be that one i think i think i'm happy with this guess somewhere here although there is a turn there okay oh this makes perfect yeah there's a turn if i had a little bit more time i might have even found this because of that turn there a really good guess a great guess to end the in the games and 18 000 points another personal best let's go let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges if you played along and on the right side there will be another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel especially now that i am doing this full time i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/8PSiJUDVKQP7Av7W",

just quit my job and now i'm doing content creation full time so if you enjoy my videos and want to support me financially check out the patreon page in the description where i offer supporter only videos and bunch of other exclusive perks we'll be playing at the map called islands of the world if you enjoyed these satellite view videos don't forget to press that like button and here we go the links will be in the description if you want to play along let's set the time limit to 10 minutes i think that's a good one and here we go so what's the first location that we get okay the island seems to be pretty small i do not recognize the shape and it doesn't look very populated we have an airport we have a few roads wait could this isn't christmas island is it what was the shape of christmas island it is christmas oh my oh the more i thought of it the more i started thinking hmm these roads kind of seem familiar okay so it is actually christmas island but let's zoom in let's have a look closer look how christmas island looks from on the above really not many houses i wonder what's the population let me quickly check apparently the population of christmas island is around 1400 people which seems about right yeah with all of these houses not too many of them just a few like towns and cities here and there so we would be on the east coast somewhere in this sort of a bay kind of how do i pinpoint this kind of yeah like here around there let's hope that's enough for a perfect score and it is okay 68 meters away great start i'm really happy that i did recognize it okay now this looks completely different and this looks tiny um how am i supposed to find this it looks tiny and the quality is just horrible this is like a potato the first run was so great this is just horrific all i can see is a small airport and that's it and i can't even zoom in properly to to investigate anything closer okay um well we have nine more minutes i was thinking would this be somewhere like pitcairn pitcairn islands where were they here here they were no not those atoms down no well basically what i'm gonna do is just zoom around and hope to see something the shape is sort of similar but there's nothing like marked there's no airport here nothing the shape isn't also exactly the same so unless i found something better i will keep it here oh wait no island but i'll i'll be looking around zooming hopefully hoping to find something helpful i've been looking all around i just don't see anything else that fits better than the one that i found at the very start it doesn't really match perfectly but maybe it's close enough because with two and a half minutes left i really don't think i'll be able to find anything better yeah i don't think it is it but but i will i will still guess here it was not there where was it oh it's so tiny yeah i mean it fits there is an airport there a lot of beaches but oh my dear lord such a tiny tiny island in the middle of like the ocean that that was a tough round props to you if you managed to find it oh okay we have some some these kind of feel like maybe volcanic islands on this particular one there is nothing interesting and we have some similar islands nearby i don't see any towns that i could zoom on and have a closer look these feel like very difficult rounds there is nothing really here where could these islands be kind of like like looks like there are high heels high coasts can we tell where the sun is see where the shadows go from the clouds the sun should be to our south okay so the sun is to our south so we should be in the northern hemisphere at least i know that much some of these islands look kind of round ish sim similarly to these in in the philippines but we have a bigger one to our west bigger one to our east and another small one to the north i feel like this is like looking for a needle in a haystack i have almost no clues i think it could be somewhere in the indonesia philippines region as there are a lot of these kind of kind of small roundish islands this feels kind of kind of impossible like an impossible task finding some some small islands without any clues except that we should be in the northern hemisphere so i think i'll be uh i'll go philippines might be somewhere like indonesia maybe or might be somewhere completely else oh my god okay it was somewhere completely ace galapagos those are galapagos oh my so this tiny oh my lord i do not see how i could have possibly found it it's so tiny i feel like i'm getting difficult rounds right the first one was like a good one the other ones okay this looks like like a bigger island with a lot of fields that's nice we have a city that we can zoom in on hopefully it's of a decent quality it is of a decent quality let's go it appears we are driving the right side here okay we have some red roofs and some black roofs this feels european now the road lines appear to be white in the middle shadows are going north so we should be in the northern hemisphere as well so i do think europe there is a coastal city here like a football field i was thinking denmark but but but might not be we have like a bigger island with some very small ones next to it a small city to the west oh oh this kind of fits now there's this thing okay i think i think this this area fits perfectly and there should be a city down here as well right kemze i think that is so where we are we are north of hems on this road um how do we pinpoint this there is a small road that that goes to the west there is another road that that goes oh yeah yeah yeah yeah we found that road that goes kind of here let's kind of try to put them together next to each other and see how far south could we be and here here i hope let's try okay 10 meters away that's a good guess boosted my morale immediately because those two second and third rounds were brutal and the last one oh oh we have some snow okay to get rid of snow you go to satellite the section and select satellite 2d and that gets should get rid of snow not sure where snow is there in general but but that's how you get rid of it we have a port a port city uh pretty relatively big compared to the others other islands that we have gotten before around about quite bright roofs light roofs i'm thinking maybe something like um greece the shadows are going north so we are in the northern hemisphere i'm thinking like greece or turkey maybe which side are we driving on we are driving on the right side greece has a lot of islands so if it actually is greece then good luck me finding it so we appear to be on a relatively large island actually on the very west could this be cyprus maybe let's have a closer look at cyprus like the alignment maybe would work i don't think it is cyprus could it be somewhere here who wait could it be this kind of looks a little bit similar but no no no these red and yellow markings i'm thinking could this be something like uh like israel or something or maybe possibly lebanon but do they have islands or are there any islands here that would work not really no islands on the coast that could fit no now i'm confused now i'm just confused could this ever be bahrain no with only one minute remaining i don't think i'll be able to find it anymore i think cyprus even though it doesn't really align i think that might be the best best guess because it feels kind of in this area but i don't know could this ever be tunisia but they do have some islands but none of those islands really match what we're looking for okay yeah let's let's see let's see where this is oh it was it was nearby i was in the right area what oh wait okay so this was what we were looking for oh my god i was thinking it looks like lebanon but i didn't realize that we are the splunk is on this tiny tiny island i was thinking that the big one with the shapes that was the island too oh that's annoying that is that is so annoying because i considered it but okay how did i do in total 14 157 points those second and third round screwed me over particularly the most but again let's let's play another game i hope i can do better in that one because i'm not super happy with my performance in the first oh no this is not a good start this is not a good start at all these are some very interesting islands though with kind of like a river going through the whole island there is a city here very red soil the sun is a little bit to the south i would say i was thinking somewhere could this be in brazil somewhere but uh where like i was thinking of this could this be one of these islands like somewhere because these islands do have some like rivers going through wherever this is it looks very remote and uh difficult another place i was considering was like i don't know where it would be in cambodia i was thinking possibly cambodia but but but i don't know where where it would be with this islands like this i don't think it could be anywhere here could this possibly be africa there are like some some islands like like that for some reason just brazil is just calling my name just calling peter guess here and then who am i to say no i think it matches the most i'll try to find the exact spot if i can i can't find anything matching but i don't think where else could it be because any other islands they don't really look like this with like rivers going through and they wouldn't have these like in the middle of an ocean i i don't think so i think i will go like here but let's see ah oh guinea pissau oh interesting yeah i never even noticed these islands to be honest because guinea bissau isn't in geogaser so i haven't paid much attention to it i guess yeah interesting they they look different than i expected them to look like okay i mean they are pretty close to the coast so make sense uh yeah not the greatest start let me know in the comments how you do in these games if you do decide to play along i think you have a really good chance of doing better than me in these these ones because they are really tough for me okay this city is looks like very very a very big one looks like a very big city here do the stadiums help us in any way that looks like a regular football field what is this not sure some sort of i don't know where is the sun the shadows go to our north which side are we driving on we are driving on the right side this feels maybe like europe it looks like this area is very mountainous when we pan around you know it gets super close to us so it looks like yeah this is these are some pretty high mounted oh what is this up here some sort of a castle no that that does feel european right like a big castle and on top of a hill a big city and a castle nearby what is what is happening here there is another city on this island with another like a fortress here i am intrigued i am intrigued where this could be roofs are all over the place so i can't really put my finger on it could this be like southern italy by any chance there are some islands wait is it actually wait wait wait wait wait is it actually here wait it is oh my god let's go so i was thinking the roofs don't really feel spanish but it might be italian and okay it really really matches with the cecilia okay so where where is the plonk the plonk is kind of kind of kind of here ish let's try to pinpoint it there is this road going [Music] maybe we can find that road yeah here is this intersection with a kind of like a twist torreita is this like a torreta city there are two two roads going here two roads here are those two roads and we would be on this one right via torre cana lottie right next to these houses i would say okay i am happy that i found that two meters away let's go let's go third round okay a lot of okay we are on small islands here so gotta learn from my mistakes these might not be islands on our to our right that might be mainland so let's not make the same lebanon mistake twice the sun the sun is a little bit to our south these are some interesting houses we said are we driving on here we are driving on the right side okay quality is really good actually the roofs are kind of darkish with some orange could this be germany let's have a look at some stadiums just a regular football stadium there there's another stadium but again [Music] nothing really no texts no not nothing really helpful i was thinking um germany but not with these large rivers going inland i'm thinking maybe maybe it's worth checking out the netherlands maybe because i know there is this this part where there a lot of rivers going like in in in land so maybe it's somewhere around there there are roads connecting all of these islands though i don't see any roads like that here but okay at least i checked it out i know it isn't there but let's have a look at the german german coast oh is it is it actually here i think it is i think it is oh it is actually germ oh let's go let's go it actually is germany roofs are so helpful if you learn to kind of tell apart roofs from different countries i'm not like super good at it but i i feel like i recognize them sometimes the roofs can be super helpful for sure so i think we should be like there right okay nice 24 meters away let's go round number four we have a pretty big city it seems wait where is the island is this the whole hall of this is the island this is so tricky this tiny one is the island here all of this city that probably isn't even an island it's like the regular city in the middle of somewhere tricky tricky tricky is it is it actually i think it is it is the washington dc no with a big big big thingy tower i don't remember this thingy's name but i'm pretty sure this is the big pool lincoln sits here that one is the washington monument the other the big thingy and we are right on an island here what is that island signers island okay signers memorial perfect one meter away that's a good one and the last round hopefully hopefully not too difficult we have a pretty long coast here and that's the island this this one might not be and probably isn't an island anymore nothing very interesting in where we are but uh let's zoom in on the city interesting houses right on the coast i was thinking florida at first could this be florida florida miami did have like a similar like like this thingy i was thinking does it align because this one goes kind of a little bit to our northeast well it mostly goes north west here in florida there is a road like this uh maybe that can help somehow if we see it we see a road connecting oh wait there is a road like no no it's similar but no maybe we should look for some more clues let's zoom in on this city and see if there is an airport here i don't see any useful texts it looks like a pretty big airport yeah with like one two three four like four or five runways and it is a pretty big city as well with so many houses and another airport here also with multiple runways so this is a big city let's zoom in on the road the sun is to our south we are driving the right side this feels very much like the u.s to me the u.s style trucks as well with this kind of longer front in europe they have the not not as long uh this this front of the truck as is in the north america this will be something like texas somewhere here oh wait yes the road the road the road fits okay it is texas yeah there was an airport hmm interesting okay i hadn't i hadn't noticed that in texas you also had have these kind of kinda like islands i knew it was they were in florida but okay in texas apparently as well so we are in texas what was that city that we were looking at here doesn't even say i guess it is part of corpus christi we have these islands we have these three islands that are kind of out of the line so we have they are here oh yeah here is that road the hook road with a hook and we are right here let's go let's go seven meters away let's do the summary this time i'm way more happy with my results except the first round not the greatest star but the other four perfect scores on the right side you will find another play along video with the satellite view and if you

peter places where all of the locations are somehow related to the word peter if you enjoy these play along videos press that like button so i know to make more of them and here we go here is the map the play along links will as always be in the description i think let's play minute and a half per location play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything here we go the first place peter pan peter pan this appears to be japan first and foremost looks like we have some japanese language uh it does appear that the camera is kind of low oh these are some pretty trees wow this is cool i don't think i've ever seen trees like this this is this looks so interesting oh my god i'm less interested in the peter place that is these trees wow also a good sign that this is japan is these uh vertical lines black and yellow you see them a lot in japan of course driving on the left side uh white and yellow plates kind of boxy looking cars all everything very japanese can we maybe see some phone numbers phone numbers can be helpful in japan yeah no phone numbers unfortunately any manhole covers i don't know this one i only know one manhole cover in japan and that's not this one so that doesn't help much so i think i'll just guess maybe near tokyo maybe maybe kind of closer here i really don't know it was all the way up there wow i only know akita um manhole cover because it has a dog on it it was pretty close but it wasn't a dog it was something else there but still at least i recognized japan let's go what is next don pedro okay don pedro we have yellow license plates which would make me think colombia maybe spanish speaking driving on the right side you know everything all the plates are yellow so i'm pretty sure this should be colombia in colombia you can also often see these kind of octagonal poles which are mostly common in mexico but sometimes you can see them in colombia too and also these are not the mexican electricity counters though that wouldn't be mexico oh if only we could see this um this sign properly it always says the city on these taxis it says the city where where the taxi is from so that's some useful information if you ever can read it doesn't seem like a very big city so i don't think it's like the capital quite mountainous but most of colombia is very mountainous so that doesn't really help ebok way maybe ibague i don't know pereira oh my god seriously i i actually said that name and i switched it oh that would have been so epic if i actually guessed there oh no but not not too bad 69 kilometers nice nice let's move on to the next location though okay unofficial coverage here what's what's petery here what's petery about this location is this saint petersburg or something something moskowski something muskowski means like in moscow like related to moscow so i think we would be in moscow oh theater like a theater like master something theater i'm not sure what's what's peter related here maybe this used to be an official coverage and then someone uploaded this and it got overwritten maybe or maybe i just don't see anything peter related so i think this is in moscow close to the river i think is that i think that's a river there can we maybe find it we have 30 seconds i don't know we're near a bridge so i'm looking next to bridges ah it was this bridge where was where was peter related piotr for fomenko workshop theater okay it was like peter for for manko this map only has 57 locations i think so we might get some repeats in these challenges but i think that's fine james peter i don't know how to pronounce it i'm sorry we have argentinian plates right we have this this kind of black dot the old style of argentinian plates nowadays they have a new style but oftentimes in google coverage you will still see this old one the sun is of course yet to the north it looks quite greenish argentinian landscapes is one of the things that i really want to study more because i often times i'm not sure where to guess i'm gonna guess somewhere around here okay it was more north could have been better but again at least i got the country so i'm happy with that and the fifth round in this map petersburg not saint petersburg just petersburg so okay is this canada or yes we have a stop sign we have double yellow lines which would make me think double yellow solid lines maybe us we have speed limit here we have a speed limit sign we have some some cars here that are some some car shop it doesn't help much this is a very very small town like 1 000 population so no chance we find that do we have front plates we do appear to have front plates on these cars i'm so bad at the us it's not going to be kansas i don't think uh nebraska could just be nebraska maybe this doesn't feel super southern it feels i'm getting kind of northern vibes here i might be wrong but i think i'll go nebraska and hope for the best it was texas okay it wasn't nearly as north as i thought but for america 2500 points definitely could have been worse 18 700 in total okay not too bad not too bad i don't know about you but i'm really enjoying this map i think these are kind of funny locations so let's play another one again link in the description uh these road signs it's norway right these look like norwegian pedestrian crossing signs to me let's have a look around yeah we have a green license plate yeah you get green license plates in norway sometimes for like business vehicles and uh you like sometimes you see these black and yellow chevrons in norway too so this is definitely norway what's peter related here i missed it oh peter's pizza peters pizza nice oh i do like pizza they got that bright how north would this be this doesn't feel very northern to me you could usually usually get trams in pretty large cities small cities don't often get tramps so maybe i'll i'll go bergen then maybe i will go bergen i'm not sure if they do have tram i'm assuming they might but let's have a look let's have a look which city is this oh okay trondheim it was more north yeah it was a was a big city but joe's the wrong one peter's pizza is still there i'm glad to see that they are still in business maybe i can visit them one day that would be pretty epic peterborough peterborough good a good town to live in oh my god what a what a motto of a town a good town to live in welcome to our town but this is a good town to live in guys if if anyone was doubting that this triangular sign you see only in the u.s these triangular signs are not in canada so so we are somewhere in the us generation four what is this scream fest i don't know some sort of halloween halloween event maybe scream fest looks like a hilly place um i'm not sure if i'm getting north east vibes or western vibes okay let's go northeast let's go northeast something like pennsylvania i don't know about plates unfortunately if i knew about license plates probably they would be very helpful but unfortunately i don't know them it was new hampshire it's always super risky it's always so risky i'm always too scared to go that far northeast because if it is somewhere else then you lose a lot of points maybe i should just risk it for the biscuits sometimes and then go there peter's coffee with a cute doggo oh my god a takeout oh i already like this place we are in korea yeah so we have some korean language i thought this looked korean on this paper here do we see any phone numbers phone numbers can be helpful in south korea uh if we see like area codes we don't have like like the area code here i don't think i don't see any at least i don't really see many clues here this seems a little bit hilly maybe but not too mountainous at least i don't see any mountains around so i think i maybe will go near seoul hoping that it might be somewhere there maybe and it was it was okay good that's a very good guess only 18 kilometers away let's go let's go okay we have a kenyan snorkel what's the saint peter saint peter's med med medical center or health health center hc health center okay oh yeah it says here a clinica don't know which city it is though uh in we have some palm trees when i see palm trees i think coastal we have a quite a few palm trees around so so the more palm trees i see the more coastal i think sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't but i'm thinking it might be something like mombasa maybe well there is really no chance that i find saint peter's medical center but i mean we can we can have a look quick quick look let's get let's get kind of more northern okay it was coastal it was very coastal wasn't it wasn't in mombasa but but to me it made more sense to guess mombasa than than somewhere here could we have even found it we couldn't have even found it it's it's not on the map next what do we have we have uh clinic therapy saint peter i got another one but this one is indonesia or malaysia i can never distinguish the languages let's have a look plates this is these are indonesian but okay it says indonesia here so it is definitely indonesia we have a white car um let's have a look call center bazaar block [Music] let's let's quickly have a look around makassar was it somewhere here makassar okay i kinda remembered it what was it saint peter clinic therapy probably not gonna find it but but at least we have the city two signs said this city it has to be here a lot of different hospitals and clinics in this city it seems government hospital and some other hospitals all over the place let's get somewhere maybe near these hospitals okay it was more here again it didn't even say anything on the on here so i don't know how how you could get a perfect score here let's view the summary 21.6 k even better than the first game very nice very nice i think we have time for one more here we go last game of the video i noticed we have this long antenna what's the peter place it's it's not english is it this this is puerto rico right yeah we don't have the front plates it's spanish i'm not sure what it means in peter neuto [Music] quests or something if you get this long antenna here on the on the right side it could be puerto rico guam and northern mariana islands if you don't have any front plates it's gonna be puerto rico that's a good way to tell that one apart in puerto rico i usually guess near san juan because most of the coverage is there and this does look like a pretty big city i would say with some some high buildings in the distance another way to tell puerto rico apart is that just signs look very american yet everything is in spanish so kind of kind of like an interesting mix so uh yeah i would go i would go somewhere in san juan and it was or it was peter carwash this this time it was on the map but very very small again no chance i could have found it which country could this be is this sign oh my god what were these signs czech or slovakia i think this was slovakia right i think this is slovakia with this long antenna as well i think czech signs looked a little bit different we have another spelling down here that i noticed and i think it might be hungarian i know that in bordering countries with hungary you often see some hungarian language so i'm thinking it might be somewhere slovakia near hungarian border so maybe let's let's have a glance along the border maybe we can find uh the town of peter somewhere town of saint peter peter was spelled differently though so that that's kind of concerning portor portor how many different spellings or pierre are there in slovakia petrovice they really like to name their towns after peters don't they peder here here here here here oh let's go literally last second found it you didn't have time to pinpoint or anything but but still that's a crazy good score let's go last second nice nice nice start peter piper pizza that that's a nice name we're in a random mall we have some spanish the domain name is dot com which doesn't really help this is official coverage i have seen some mall coverage i think in mexico and argentina which one would this be do we have any any indications on which one this is no dominant there i think i'm going argentina is that no that's not a flag uh i hope i didn't miss any obvious clues but i'm going buenos aires and hope were the best and it was mexico if you noticed something that i missed please let me know how i could have known it was mexico cause to me it was 50 50 between those two uh fourth location here driving on the left side so new zealand or australia vet services why kiwi with such a name it has to be new zealand what was the peter place i see a peter i'm guessing that's the peter rabbit but but something some city with a with a bow starting with a b saint stephen's church center something i don't see any big cities bland it's not blunheim it didn't say blondheim there i don't see any bus cities but do we have any mountains nearby no we don't this is either like like somewhere near christ church maybe or is this this might be northern ireland i couldn't see the road number the road number could have been very helpful i think i'll go near christ church uh okay oh bluff they must have said bluff it was relatively large i guess i could have seen it but but missed it unfortunately bluff okay but at least i went with southern ireland so not too bad welcome to peterborough station peterborough oh this is uk where was peterborough in uk oh i should know this or are there multiple peterboroughs where was oh here is peterborough okay okay okay is this the right one i don't know there might be multiple ones peterborough station there is peterborough is this a railway station or train does it say train train times we are a train the road direction is kind of north we have around about around about here are we here round about two hours south are are we here i'm really not sure wait wait rose do we have way throws there no i don't think that fits that fits much better i didn't notice this tiny tiny round about here but it definitely fits much much better yeah i was thinking the roads don't really line up but i didn't see a better alternative but still almost a perfect score in this round i'm happy about that and in total again 18 and a half thousand not too bad how did you do in these games did you beat me let me know in the comments below and on the right side you will find another play along video i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you'll have a wonderful rest of your day be

"https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/G4rB9BS77khaUZee"], "transcript": "i was in the mood for something simpler today so in this video we'll be playing the capital cities of the world from the satellite view if you enjoyed this satellite videos press that like button so i know to make more of these and here we go if you want to play along the challenge links will be in the description make sure to play it before watching this video and you also need to have the unity script installed on your browser i'm planning to make a tutorial how to add it so it might be up already so check it out this is a coastal capital looks really really cool at this river i know with these flows uh where's the sun okay let's let's have a look what do we have oh this is an interesting building here the sun appears to be a little bit to the north i think this this type of very very interesting roof the first thought is like maybe indonesia or something looking at this roof but let's let's explore a bit more which side are we driving on here oh the quality isn't good i can't really tell yet but but hopefully we can figure it out it does appear that we are driving on the left side here yeah yeah these trucks it seems that they are driving on the left side so indonesia isn't is a possibility i don't think this would be jakarta jakarta doesn't have the coast on the left side does it yeah it is too close to the north so it's not going to be jakarta malay kuala lumpur maybe kuala lumpur is close to the coast but not coastal really so it's not kuala lumpur let's look for more clues maybe let's look for some more clues so we are driving the left side this we have close to our west that's already a lot i just don't want to brute force it through the capitals i want to find some additional clues to make it more interesting for me and you i think driving on the left side really helps so what it could really be is yeah like something like like like um asia or maybe um something like southern africa couldn't be like europe no way this is like uk or ireland but but yeah not too many countries driving on the left side what i notice is that houses are very built close together and from what i've seen in africa usually in africa houses are like more spread apart and they won't be this built up so i'm kind of leaning asia because of that you know these like houses on top of houses feel more asian to me than african for sure a lot of shipping containers so seems like a big shipping city which asian countries the drive on the left have their capital coast to their left thailand but no bangkok doesn't really fit yeah it's real sri lanka sri lanka has a huge port how did i forget about sri lanka it is sri lanka yeah yeah sri lanka makes so much sense the dot that we are looking for is what is this thing i totally missed it before some sort of look at like is that a tv tower or something let's let's find that out it is colombo lotus tower oh very pretty so we are somewhere here right on this road it seems close to the lotus tower like here i would say let's have a look 102 meters okay almo almost almost lost some points here but still 102 meters away but still perfect score good good let's move on oh another coastal one you guys know i like coastal cities coastal cities are easier to find in my opinion because i know where in terms of the country continent and everything that this the city will be we are driving on the right side it seems it looks like the front shield this is here a very white roof so i'm thinking maybe in a middle east um somewhere in that area at northern africa maybe we have a big airport this is airport right looks like one yeah yeah would libya have such a huge airport i don't think so algeria algeria has a lot of people would make sense that they have a big airport you have some sort of a very interesting like complex this is a cool roof kind of like a flower this is a cool place what is this this might be something famous maybe kind of like like octagon us has pentagon this country has octagon algiers no it's not algiers doesn't really work this is this is such a cool park maybe not the best location for people to visit in the middle of motorway but looks like a really cool place could it actually be libya tripoli no it's not it muscat no is it actually muscat it is it is actually muscat wow interesting so my first thought about it being like a looking middle eastern was right but i kind of gravitated more towards northern africa so what is that octagonal building i'm interested in it looks like this ministry of housing interesting building for the ministry of housing there but what we are looking for we are looking for this intersection here this is the intersection we are looking for asa what tower we have here where which one is the tower is this the tower not sure but we are basically right here between these buildings looks looks right to me we have the the river oh the river is completely dried i was thinking i didn't see this river here but the river is completely dry let's go it was spot on 18 meters away let's go next round so we have some mountains here not coastal this time so it's not going to be all coastal we have a stadium again with without any writings red houses the red roofs make me feel kind of european maybe driving on the right side it seems sun is to our south which would put us in the northern hemisphere hilly capital city huh looks like a very big one as well very big i'm thinking like switzerland could this be switzerland maybe that's my first thought but but but let's let's have a have a some more look looking around this is a cool looking stadium maybe some football enthusiasts immediately recognize it possibly not me not me unfortunately yeah i don't really can't really find anything else interesting to show around i guess the unique features here are these kind of kind of lakes i was thinking my first thought was switzerland so let's go to switzerland maybe maybe burn fits no burn has this this river going through it's not gonna be burned then um what else could it be it's not not vienna or could it be lichtenstein by any chance vadods no vaduz looks very different like very unique not going to be vaduts okay okay it was tirana i had a look a little bit look around some of the european capitals that i thought were mount could be mountainous and tirana fits perfectly most european capitals actually have a river going through it seems so so most of them were immediately discarded there is a tiny tiny river going through which we did have this tiny tiny river here that matches perfectly and we have these two lakes here those are artificial lakes i guess to add some greenery to the city which is really cool we are right above this the left lake here here ish what do we have we are not really at the roundabout this roundabout is up here i'm really not sure it's so difficult to tell where the streets are going here because they are all the buildings are so tall hard to tell where is the street and where is the backyard but i think we should be around this area perfect spot on let's go let's go oh next round oh another coastal one okay let's have a look i have i have some initial thoughts immediately but let's have a look we have sun to our north so we would be in the southern hemisphere with this kind of greenery and mountains i'm thinking maybe like northern uh north of southern america because it doesn't look like a very big city i mean it looks like a large city but it isn't very densely populated we have a lot of like private houses not too close to each other looks really cool from above actually all these tiny tiny houses everywhere they don't have any like huge apartment buildings and stuff so so i think one of those looks like small like like countries like tsurinami would work pretty well we have a river here which will be a very good good factor to pin for pinpointing a lot a lot of forests here which is nice to see is it here we have a river but no that's not the one caracas no no no no no it's not going to be karakos so it is not the north of south america hmm my assumptions have been wrong it's not here it appears we are driving the left side here which do suriname drive actually i think they might actually be driving the left side yeah they are drawing on the left side yeah that's what i thought but it is not tsurinami though could this ever be brunei maybe no no yeah it does not work doesn't look like that really the big water to the north is what confuses me because there really aren't too many countries with big water to the north with a capital like that oh it actually is oh that's an interesting one it was solomon islands that definitely wouldn't have been my main guess at all but like the the fact that we had a small such a small population and a capital made me think maybe maybe i should be looking at like these these islands we are around like here ish so that we have these two two kind of splitting roads here somewhere here i guess okay not too bad the other side of the kitchen 90 meters away next round round number five oh we have the snow if you get this kind of snow or rain what you can do is you can go to uh and switch to satellite 2d and it will will disable it we have uh a river going through here splitting into we have not the best quality ima imagery driving on the right side appears sun is to our south so northern hemisphere red roofs should make me think on the kind of mediterranean maybe somewhere oh this is a cool church thinking like bosnia bosnia herzegovina maybe with a church like that wait i think this is belgrade no i think this is serbia i think serbia had like a river going through like this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think serbia had like this part here and like another part here and like river splitting it into i think this is belgrade yeah like this type of church made me think like that area like bosnia or serbia or somewhere there so belgrade makes perfect sense i think i'm pretty sure is it let's go to serbia does belgrade fit belgrade does fit i think yes yes it does we are it's really cool that builder is such a lot of greenery i really like that about belgrade so we're close to this bridge here we would be somewhere here right above this small below this small road okay 54 meters away that's really good view the summary a perfect score that's lovely and let's play another challenge again the link will be in the description make sure to play it before watching and here we go oh this is cool my first thought would be uh maldives because i know maldives look kind of like this excellent island an island nation with some beautiful beaches it appears we have a an airport right here if it's not maldives then it's somewhere in oceania the sun is up to the north so we should be in the southern hemisphere huh so maybe it won't be maldives then where is malay here is malay does not really fit yeah that's what i was afraid of so we'll need to look for some of these these other small islands to follow maybe it was it was to value okay yeah to follow matches value matches this shape we are next near near the airport now we do have an airport here an afuti international airport i can't tell which ones of these are the roads which are are not mapped i mean all of these roads look the same but some are on the maps some aren't this might be that house here this one which is on top of the street basically so i'm thinking we are somewhere like here maybe okay we were on the intersection let's go so five meters away good job let's move on to the next one a pretty big city here with some mountains that to our south it appears where is the sun the sun is oh there's so many cars here wow sun is two hours south a lot of cars which are we driving on here we are driving on the right side this is a big big big city we have a stadium here again with no no texts oh what is this hello some sort of big statue a lot of greenery some blue roofs which is interesting better getting kind of mongolian vibes but but could this be mongolia no kyrgyzstan kyrgyzstan i was thinking kyrgyzstan has these mountains to our south i thought that would be kind of snowy but i guess maybe not this is the layout looked very familiar to me it felt kind of kyrgyzstan and also this um this big field you get these kind of big fields with statues like in mongolia kyrgyzstan like other neighboring countries it does look different than i had imagined from uh from top also some blue roofs blue rose also made me think like that area um how do i pinpoint this one we have the rail some railroad here i think we have a railroad here yeah we have this this round place this kind of very cool looking district or was it here is the round district we are where is that we are kind of north east of that round district somewhere here ish we would be somewhere um so it was would be here but we do have these two parallel streets that cross the railway here yeah yeah yeah that fits so i'm pretty sure we should be right here in this building here okay 50 meters nice guess let's go on to the third round here we have a river kind of splits into two and then back into one and back into two next to the river it's very green very big city very big city oh my dear lord how big this city is i'm thinking something like like like uh damascus or something maybe because near the river it's very green when it's not near the river it's looks very sandy and dry surely we are driving on the right side here right yeah we are doing there is some very big big like bridges nice looking bridges and buildings looks really cool a nice look nice looking park a lot of greenery i like greenery as you know and further away from the river it gets much much more dry let's have a look at damascus damascus yeah doesn't really work they don't really have a river going through could this be bug gods with the tigris going through no tigress looks different it's not techron yerevan is too green baku is near the caspian sea oh my god it's just cairo okay it makes sense with such a huge city and well well developed city makes sense for us to be cairo for and this is denial of course for some reason i i like i was sure it's gonna be somewhere here in in the middle east wait can we see the pyramids i think the pyramids might be a little bit off off the of the our viewing range and did you know that egypt is building a new capital city it's not going to be cairo soon uh i mean they have new cairo city they're building another one like here-ish or something i'm getting off topic we have uh so this kind of kind of like a monument here which should help us with pinpointing i think we are kind of here right down here looks like a nice place i've been to cairo once before i i liked it i liked it i didn't spend too much time there back when i was there the air was very kind of kind of not clean a dirty dirty air maybe they have improved the air quality i don't know about that back when i was there all the sand you know not a good air to breathe let's have a look we have something guatemala let's go that helps that helps so this should be guatemala what is this here are these like golf golf fields golf courses i guess looks so interesting from above again biggest problem is that the pinpointing we are like here ish we have these railroad tracks here next i think this is the stadium yeah with these railroad tracks that helps so we are south west of there we have this this kind of interesting looking intersection with some some pole in the middle right here doesn't say what that pole is but okay i think that has to be it nice yeah we should be right here six meters away let's go let's go and the last round zooming out zooming out okay okay a big city again with mountains to the north and the city is going into the mountains like a river mountains to our south as well and there is a river going through the city the sun is to our south so we're in the northern hemisphere some blue roofs some kind of green or teal roofs oh this is a big palace big palace with a huge park i'm guessing that's like the leader's palace i was thinking like could this ever be iran maybe i'm not sure though if tehran matches i know they have some mountains to the north but they don't really have mountains to the south i notice two airports we have one airport here one up here doesn't really help me i don't think but yeah we we are driving on the right side yeah as i suspected i was thinking it might be somewhere maybe middle eastern but i'm really not sure these steel roofs seem very interesting i can't remember seeing teal roofs before duchamp has some mountains to the north some mountains to the south we do have a river going through here yeah it is duchamp yes okay yeah when we we have air base an airport here perfect perfect we found it so what is that that that palace or prison presidential palace it is yeah as i suspected and we are on the river basically let's be uh it should be like across this part this part of buildings it should be like um here here ish 49 meters okay it is a perfect score on the right side you will find another play along video in the satellite view i think you will enjoy huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "image_not_available": [5], "images_path":

playing city centers with at least 1 million population as always the play along links will be in the description if you want to play along make sure to play do it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything good luck everyone unfortunately i don't think there will be any baltic countries because i don't think nothing and any of them has uh a city with 1 million living in them a b gadgets is the author here maybe gadgets.net website doesn't help it looks kind of spanish maybe doesn't look english i don't recognize any of the words so service world centro the you know it looks looks like it is spanish i don't really see any oh what the okay i hope everyone is fine in this car um yeah i was thinking something like like like like haiti maybe porto prince i am kind of getting like like uh dominican republic puerto rico vibes but i think in those countries probably there would be official coverage right in this map okay never mind they did choose unofficial for dominican republic as well at least the vibes were correct for me i'm happy with that i guess i should have gone with dr in hindsight hindsight 20 20. i'm still still 4000 points pretty good pretty good and now this we have sun to the south sun to the south uh in case anyone's wondering how do i know that sun is to the south we have compass right here on the bottom left corner the red points to the north since the southern direction is more to the sun the sun is to the south um we have a stop sign which we cannot read lovely the car doesn't help much do we have any electricity counters this looks like a difficult one i'm thinking mexico or something maybe maybe mexico if we could read the stop sign that would be super helpful because in mexico it should say alto but it's unreadable unfortunately the plates look like they might be from mexico i think i don't see any electricity counters which is concerning though in mexico you have those circular ones oh i need to guess the time is running out uh let's go somewhere here ah it was it was mexico actually it was mexico just literally the completely opposite side of mexico oh no i thought it looked quite southern to me but yeah i guess i was wrong it was super close to to the border with the u.s tijuana we have a phone number so this is russia these are russian style cell phone numbers but 919 doesn't help i know the area codes of russia the russian phone numbers but but none of these phone numbers have the area code that helps because the 900s are mobile phone numbers and they could be anywhere but yeah this is a russia wild berries city with at least one million population but imagine russia has plenty of those because they have a lot of cities a lot of cities but like 75 percent of russia russians live in the european part which is an interesting fact fun fact 75 of russia's population live in the european part european russia so i will guess european part for instance this this map is all about large cities with a large population right now surely has one million as well right it doesn't feel like moscow i would go like something like lasagna or maybe something like it makes perfect sense yeah we have uh blender nice blender should be malaysia right yeah we have the flag i meant indonesia should be indonesia we have the flag but also the plates are indonesian with the three white sections instead of two in malaysia you get two wet sections so indonesia also has a lot of big cities a lot of big cities have i heard of tongarang before let's quickly glance over so we can find tongarang if it's a big city it should be visible from from pretty far right okay it was oh there was i knew i've heard of it oh my god it was this not really a suburb it is a separate city i guess but but but like in a side city to jakarta i knew i've heard of it but they couldn't find it okay again 4 000 points could be worse could be worse not my best game though so you can definitely do better than i other than me and this one good luck i hope you do uh rhode island brighton rhode island rhode island was here at rhode island which isn't really an island i'm guessing this probably is providence i'm assuming providence is probably the only city there with one million because rhode island is quite small we have city hall um can we find the city hall in providence what are the road directions you know like diagonal diagonal with the turn i might have had this around before i'm getting kind of flashbacked getting kind of like i feel like i remember having this round but where providence city hall oh my god it is quite central i mean city halls are usually quite central so if you get those that's a good idea to to search kind of in the middle of the city amazing tip i know you are welcome you are most welcome so we are kind of here-ish and yes yes we were there indeed at least one 5k and let's do the summary definitely could be better definitely could be better because because there were some pretty far rounds the mexico round was was even further than the russian round but let's do another one let's go for another challenge link again in the description this is pretty oh um is this that uh is this in dubai or abu dhabi and i know in one of those cities there is this building with kind of like big to two big towers with kind of like this this um corrie door i'm not sure if this is that building but i just know in either um dubai or abu dhabi there is such a building it is quite dark it looks like could that be now burj khalifa would be taller right it would be nice if we if we had light it's hard to tell in the dark if it looks like uae or not it might be like something like us or something maybe but i will i will go dubai since that was my first first instinct might be abu dhabi but i would go with dubai first i have no idea where that building is that i'm thinking maybe someone in the comments know which building i am thinking of but yeah oh yeah there was a different building than i was think that i was thinking what was it it was a mall i guess oh no what what is or i don't think it was a copy coffee shop so i guess it is a little bit misplaced maybe it was the mall decent start could it could be better could be worse we have the blue strip 3d uh that's the only thing that i can read there 3d not very helpful stop we have these kind of edgy edgy uh guard rails which can be helpful i know a couple of countries which have edgy girls oh we have on a blue and yellow train could this be no this is this isn't ukraine this i don't think this is ukraine um i was thinking something like um czechia slovakia maybe let's go or poland could this be poland this could be poland this peace sign this stop sign uh like parking sign looks very polished to me their p letter is kind of like like the big like this and poland also has guard rails like that i'm thinking poland but where one million population it doesn't feel like warsaw doesn't feel like war so let's go maybe um krakov let's go krakov croco is a big city oh my god again the completely opposite side of the country oh come on so it was at least it was poland i got that that much correct completely opposite side this is i guess this is not my day for challenges uh what is this now um we have wide white plates it feels the like the philippines to me i'm getting big the philippines these oh my god these these every time i see these uh wires i'm getting anxious as a european this looks insane to me this looks just crazy what's happening with these wires oh but yeah off topic i think this is um the philippines guadalupe guadalupe huh well these are also common uh bosses to jeepneys i think was the name jeepneys in the philippines i'm looking if it says the city somewhere maybe is guadalupe a city in the philippines guadalupe it is guadalupe in two places don't see any guadalupes so i guess we just guess in in manila my big queso city let's see it was taboo city okay what it's a guadalupe in two places i wonder interesting interesting maybe they are big fans of guadalupe next round this looks like china maybe possibly we have some some um what i think looks like chinese language mandarin probably and china does have a lot of big cities very many big cities with at least one million population i think we just choose a random city in china and hope for the best here i don't see any landmarks that i recognize any texts that i could read let's go nanjing maybe let's go hangzhou let's switch to hangzhou kind of close close to shanghai let's see let's see well similar similar sounding name but yeah i don't know if anyone got the city right let me know how because this is just a random guess from me this looks like uh malaysia indonesia i don't recognize this car just feels kind of like in that area i think the plate looks kind of indonesian i think it looks like we have three white sections here hard to see but but i think there are three white sections in indonesia phone numbers can be helpful and postal codes can be helpful but i see neither here unfortunately so so all we have to go by is the architecture which i don't really know that well for indonesia i think these style ropes i might be wrong i think these style roofs were more common in the the um java island i'm thinking maybe bandung this time i think i'll go bandung and then hope for the best it was very southern of the the sumatra island let's view the summary even worse than in the first game oh my god to be fair there were some very difficult rounds here okay very difficult rounds let me know how you did in these challenges and on the right side there will be another geographer play along video huge thanks all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you

we'll be giving a wikipedia article and our task is to find the location which is nearby that place described in the article we'll be playing about down squares which contains noun squares from all around the world the score average scores says it's very easy to play along the links will be in the description but you do need to have a unity script the link for unity script will also be in the description so let's go so einsa einsa is the city municipal term is the main town in the eins municipal term arrogant spain so aragon is that that region so i answer should be somewhere up here then i still don't see it where is einsa there's andorra here i didn't know there is a city called andorra in spain but that might get a little bit confusing for someone living in andorra especially where do you live oh i live in nandora but but in spain uh but i still don't see einsa okay einsa finally found it very small actually let's view exactly what we are looking for so the river and the road is to our east okay there's the bridge so that's the bridge so we should be somewhere here right i think we're exactly kind of here ish right yeah i think we are here i think we are here let's go three meters great start what do we have next let's switch back to this view alexander nevskika three cathedral watch oh i know where vodge is without even even looking around alexander nevsky cathedral is a christian orthodox church located in the city of waj in central poland built in the late 19th century as a gift from the local industrial industrialist to the small orthodox community lovely lovely so our task is now to find alexander nevsky cathedral not sure how large it is it might might not be very big one it might be a small one let's see what exactly are we looking for from the street view so there's like a park here and bunch of bunch of houses the street is going a little bit tilted okay okay okay so let's have a look there are a couple of streets going that way i mean since this is the map called towns uh town squares it should be relatively central i would imagine is is it is it somewhere here maybe i don't see the cathedral though alexander nevsky cathedral okay uh so sobors alexandra niveskiva i think it should be that so okay so we're again where exactly we were we were yeah basically right there i guess that's that's that small road so i think we should be right there let's go 13 meters still perfect score happy with that let's go next robson square robson square is a landmark civic center and public plaza located in downtown vancouver okay this might be like might not be like a super challenging mode or anything but i really like it because it kind of helps you to explore other countries on a different level like geoguesser by itself is a great way to explore other countries but this like lets you lets you read about them a little bit more so that's that's i i find that one that really cool downtown vancouver here we go here we go um robson square robson street okay that's the robson street i mean imagine robson square should be here we go yeah next robson street good so robson square let's let's open up the street view mode where exactly are we so so that's the robson square so we are i mean we are basically right uh almost where i have clicked now and like maybe a little bit more here ish i think let's let's see let's go nine meters okay can i get a perfect score that would be pretty cool so morelia grenade attacks oh no the morrelia grenade attacks took place on 15 september 2008 oh no plaza milchor ocampo the main square of the mexican city morelia so morelia is the city that we are looking for me so in that area in like western mexico the way the articles are picked are basically look you click on the location and the closest article to that location is chosen so so sometimes articles like these might happen as well so it is this this uh region morelia can we find morelia morelia here we go pretty big city so what was the pla plaza melchor ocampo the main square so that's the main square so it should be pretty big right let's maybe have a look what are we looking for from the satellite's view okay so we have like a cathedral to our left the roads are basically horizontal and vertical making like small small squares all around so that's that's the square with a like a cathedral okay so it might be somewhere here then is is it this one this is the one i saw it before but it doesn't doesn't say plaza milchor or campo plaza maybe maybe they rebranded it or something because because i mean it would fit right alignment fits there is a cathedral to our east where exactly were we standing right in the middle there so somewhere here ish i guess let's go seven meters good good good next round rose theater brampton the rose in a municipality-owned theater located in downtown brampton ontario okay so we are in ontario brampton huh where where is brampton don't know brampton london barry oh here is brampton okay okay good i thought i have maybe seen it before but i couldn't remember where was built as a cultural and tourist destination that will attract significant new businesses to surrounding restaurants shops and services okay so rose theater that's what we are looking for rose theater which should be close to a town square let's let's have a look in the in the satellite view so okay so we have a like a road or railway going like that and rode kind of diagonally and this is this is the theater i would assume okay let's switch back here then we have a railway going here okay perfect bros theater okay yeah the railway really helped there because i noticed there's a big railway going through the sea middle of the city so so yeah okay perfect and where exactly where we uh located the pin oh the pin is right well okay it disappeared but it was right there um on the front front of theater somewhere here ish i think 30 meters perfect perfect score let's go let's go let's do another game i really like this let's go for the next game another challenge of course link in the description if you enjoy these challenges press that like button leave a comment so i know uh that to make more of these and it also helps the youtube algorithm to reach more people so thank you very much for liking the video sh okay so that is the main and the largest town square in cottor montenegro i think i've heard of kotor where was kotor here it was yeah kind of close though i thought i've heard of it so could uh what was the name oh here we go don't know i have no idea what that means hopefully that's nothing rude well probably not right if it's the town square i see some turgs other targs here but but what is there what's ya what does dirk mean let's quickly translate it okay terg literally means like square so original square i'm guessing that's what it means so okay origia square is here let's have a look from above so there's like a bridge here and we are on the southern side of the bridge also right here right here than we are perfect let's go seven meters i i like this map i like this wikipedia mode it's like it's a nice change from the usual geographer in my opinion seven hills skate park okay the seven hill skate park 650 square meter concrete skate park located at samir al-raifay rifai park in downtown amman jordan named for the seven hills that the city is built on was wasn't rome also built on seven hills or something i thought the rome was like the city built on seven hills or was it a different number not sure but okay downtown downtown amman so there's like a roundabout the cities in jordan knows they're so interesting the the flow all over the place really really fascinating so but it looks like we have a roundabout and there are a bunch of bunch of bunch of uh streets going all around us okay let's let's try to well let's try to find it oh is this it is this it this looks very interesting but but is it is it it is it right no no it is not it it looks very interesting as well but that's not it unfortunately but it could be it might be somewhere in this area because the roads seem like similar like kind of kind of going all over the place oh oh is it it yeah okay i think it is zoomed in okay perfect so we should be right here where's the skate park though i don't see the skate park here i mean as i mentioned it takes the closest wikipedia article to the place so maybe the skatepark is a little bit away just it was the closest article okay perfect 5000 points next round um okay let's switch back to the wikipedia character karata is a city in the province of chaco argentina it has 26 000 inhabitants and is the head town of the chakka buko department where is that chokabuko department is a western department of choco province located 280 kilometers from the provincial capital residency is located in the north east of the country north east so somewhere here residency oh here is a i've heard of residency but i cannot find it northeast of the country okay residencia here it is you really need to zoom in to find it so we are not in residency we are in charotta so is it located 280 kilometers from this place okay it does show choco province on the map you really need to zoom in a lot though so the this is the border here it said it's in south west of the right of the province right wait chaka buko department is right here right here so we should be like somewhere here okay here is charata yes found it found it okay let's let's switch to the satellite view see where we are we are so on one of the streets like this square how are we gonna find it is this the square one one green square in all of the well there's another one here actually oh wait yeah i think i think this is actually the one because it has the pathways kinda like going in all directions this this one also has pathways in all directions i think this is it yeah there is some greenery on the top corner as well which might be here i guess yeah there are some some tree sign so i guess there is some greenery here we just don't see it on the map so we should be right here then i think let's guess let's go four meters okay next round what do we have we have sandness district court sandness district court was a district court in rogueland county norway so rogoland county so very south west southwest so is i'm missing sadness okay a town of sadness that is the name of the town sadness district court so south west sandness here we go sandness found it pretty quickly so where exactly are we so we have like like a bay or something oh here yeah that we have we see that and we are basically right here are we i think we are yes i think so nice this is a quick round let's move on to the next one switch back azam khan government commerce college so it is the first commerce college in bangladesh it is located in upper jisor road kulna kulna bangladesh kulna okay does it say where kulna is located doesn't say walnut is it big oh it is big okay it is big i wasn't sure how big it will be but i spotted it pretty much instantly okay azam khan commercial college well first of all let's have a look at the satellite view again so we have some like a river on the north east at a river we have a road that goes like that so we do have some rivers nearby a road that goes like that that don't see that from the first glance this could it be it continues horizontally that's not the one that's not oh this one yes this one fits so it goes like that so what was the coolness what was the college azam khan government commerce college do we see that somewhere i don't see it there are some schools i mean there is a school here without a title maybe that's the one azam khan government covered commerce college here we here we have it yeah okay so it is here and exactly where do we see so we are basically right here i think right next to this large larger house perfect six meters away another perfect score let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges and on the right side you will find the first part of the wikipedia guesser huge thanks to all the patreons and members for supporting this channel

places from bird's eye view map it's supposed to be an easy map so hopefully i recognize all of them i read your feedback in the previous video saying that five minutes is too little so i thought let's increase the time limit to 10 minutes so hopefully that's better that's twice as long and then hopefully i have more time to look for places and explain what i see to you guys so the link to play along will be in the description just make sure to play it before watching this video so don't spoil anything uh good luck you know to play along you can play along with the free geogra version as well you don't need to have a pro account let's have a look what do we have something red that catches my eye immediately what is this so first of all what's the famous place we're playing famous places map what is that what is that i have no idea what i'm what i'm looking at okay i just realized that's a building this one okay i wasn't sure what i'm looking at here so this is like a high building with was this place in like um what was this i might be thinking of a different building but was it something like um i think there was like a might be mistaken i was thinking that like there might be a similar building in doha kind of like what i don't know looks kind of like a taser that's what i'm associating it to looking like a two rods with something in between like a taser building um the um i mean it does look very sandy quite arid so middle east would make sense we should be driving on let's check it out uh we are driving the right side okay um so if it is not doha i still think it should be somewhere around here i've definitely seen that building before but but as you know i'm pretty bad with famous places uh so i i don't know where exactly that one is dojo's roads don't seem to fit let's try to maybe turn on the um the satellite view and then compare it does look very similar right could it be somewhere here i don't see any like [Music] matches does look very similar though this red thing it surely would help us right and there's a baseball field here i guess they play some baseball in the dark let's have a look at some other cities kuwait bahrain maybe could it be bahrain bahrain seems too small i feel like in bahrain we would surely see some water around dum mum could it be dum mum roads kinda alone we have an intersection that looks like that kinda looks different though kuwait could this be kuwait kuwait city maybe i'm pretty certain it should be one of these um middle eastern cities but which one i don't know unfortunately doesn't seem to be this one either riyadh could it be riyadh maybe yeah the road's a line i mean the yacht is a big city so it makes sense where i would have well it would have big buildings right so let's have a look oh okay again first thing that catches my eye that red red red field okay we found it we found it okay we have this building here it was basically right in the middle of that building right so basically right here okay 26 meters away let's go let's go kingdom center that's a shopping mall apparently a big shopping mall okay needless to say i have not been there maybe one day who knows okay we noticed some some um sports fields next to each other each bigger than the other when one when one gets too small let's build another one next to it looks so weird they're like eight football football fields next to each other here this is like a mini one anyways getting distracted there we have a river that goes what's the famous place here is that the bridge famous i'm guessing a bridge is famous here i mean this feels like europe with these orange roofs and and just general feeling and yeah everything okay it looks like we're drawing on the right side any other clues so the famous place is a bridge there is one very famous bridge in budapest and of course in london well this isn't london i would recognize london so i'm thinking could this be that that big bridge in budapest i remember that was like a very famous one the river doesn't really fit okay so it's not the budapest bridge i guess let's let's go through some european cities and see where the river goes like that kind of running out of ideas here i feel like i've zoomed in on most european capitals really fits with this river i mean it might not be the capital oh my god is it prague oh my god it is broke how did i check literally every other city in the in the europe before prague i mean this bridge i think so oh my god okay okay okay i literally have 30 seconds remaining this looks like a like a famous bridge iconic 14th century structure with views okay okay yes zero meters let's go let's go i feel like 10 minutes is a great time because i feel like that's just right enough yeah let me know in the in the comments oh this is this is uh uae with these kind of artificial man-made islands right oh this is the super expensive hotel right but was it abu dhabi or dubai was it by okay i guess it was dubai the super super burj al arab was it that i think so yeah it's super expensive i'm pretty sure we are there right let's zoom out a little bit just to confirm we have this thingy yeah yeah we are right there okay i recognize this one i've watched some youtube videos not not that i've been there wait what the hell is this now first of all why are there some some snowflakes falling i mean i mean it might be raining right now within this place but but i don't want to see it if we zoom close enough it doesn't appear so that's nice okay i'm not sure where this is what's this famous place supposed to be this mountain range or something wait is this is this like the the the um china china walls the the wall of china is it it kind of looks like a big wall doesn't it so it might be it might be yeah it looks quite mountainous as well i guess yeah we can look around the great wall of china is like north east of beijing right somewhere great wall great wall oh okay here it is okay if we zoom far in close enough great wall of china let's um switch to satellite view again is it here is the is this the city i think it is yeah the colors are different but this city has like this thingy going out of it the city also has the thingy going on i think that's the same city and we are okay north east they're like here so that is that turn i think we are here right i think let's zoom in more to this tower i think we are right here on this tower okay let's go 10 meters hopefully the next location doesn't have that rain view i i was not a big fan of that kind of useless feature seemed like it oh my god no okay at least the raid rain is to our right side we don't need to look at it i guess we have what's the famous place oh sydney opera house let's go so sydney opera house some of these are easier some of these are super difficult well i guess the ones that i recognize are easy so sydney opera house we are right uh here let's go six meters away perfect score let's go let's go let's play another another game hopefully you got a pretty good score as well let me know in the comments and leave a like if you enjoy these uh play along videos satellite view so i know to make more of them we looks like we have like a waterfall or something here like a big waterfall this this isn't niagara waterfall is it or is it maybe it is let's have a look let's have a look at niagara waterfall where was it niagara falls is it kind of alliance doesn't it i think it is niagara falls yeah okay and we have that thingy this is the island so we should be right here somewhere here horseshoe falls or something i hope i'll be close enough because it appears that we are right some like here ish 100 no one point we were spot on on the horseshoe falls apparently it looked like we were more inside no one point lost no still very close a good score oh we this is like a famous bridge again i guess it is yeah okay some sort of a famous bridge no rain let's go uh then this looks like europe again with these red houses and and many many many many bridges over the river and any clues about which country this might be i mean let's have a look which side we're driving on surely we're driving in the right side right right uh yeah it looks like we are driving in the right side here no surprises there the shadows are going to the north so that confirms it the river goes look pretty much straight with some minor turns there is a church here this this feels like something you would see maybe in um serbia croatia somewhere in that area so let's let's see let's have a look at belgrade belgrade doesn't fit uh zagreb no the river doesn't fit well let's let's zoom around and see some other cities nearby maybe okay nothing nothing very helpful this doesn't feel like a very huge river so that might be a big issue seems like a pretty small one actually without recognizing what the bridge is it's like some some old stone bridge or something i can't put my finger on it this this church i feel like the church should definitely help but what country i would see a church like that i don't know how how do i find a small river going through some city i still have two minutes to go so not everything has been lost i've been zooming around like crazy i cannot find anything that really matches italy ah lawrence i i checked out rome let's see that rome i think i checked out naples i did not check florence we really need to zoom in a lot ah this is a tough one at least for me oh no raining again seriously i quickly messaged the developer of this script and the rain is disabled in satellite 2d that's good so so no more rain thank thank god uh so what we have here we have a tall tall tower i was thinking is this like the berlin one whatever it was called i know in berlin there is like a huge tower like that you can see the shadow is pretty big with some bulb there was something like that in berlin right um i like zander plots right but this isn't alexander plot yeah this this was the bulb no wait it is it is oh it is okay okay i thought it looked different in in the default view i guess yeah okay berlin offensive one so we go there i guess let's go let's go i thought it looks familiar i've been to berlin twice i i liked it i know some some germans don't like berlin i like it well i'm not german maybe that's why oh this thing oh was it in i always forget if it's in denmark or in belgium i don't know why i can't remember if it was in denmark or belgium it is like atomium or something called so it's one one of those places uh one of those countries belgium was it a belgium oh how will i find this we do have a river nearby okay and a very big city very big city here so is it brussels there is a river going here automium here we go okay luckily atomium is visible from very far away okay for some reason i wasn't thinking it's the capital but i guess it is this went by easier than i thought it would be would go okay two meters what's this one um some somewhere very mountainous i it appears looks so weird from from the above what is this place huh was this like grand canyon or something maybe i was thinking these are like mountains but these are holes um let's i guess let's have a look at the city which said we are driving on oh it doesn't look like an american city i was thinking maybe grand canyon but the city doesn't look american which side are we driving on here it looks like we are driving on the left side oh well i'm guessing this is somewhere like south africa then we have a big river driving the left side there's a big city up here is there such a big river in south africa somewhere something like kenya i mean technically this could be anywhere right it doesn't even need to be a country with official coverage technically it could be anywhere thus far we've only had official coverage countries but but i guess it could be something like zombie or i don't know i i don't think it's australia but i guess let's glance glance over and there are some rivers but but what doesn't really feel like australia to me wait the sun i didn't check which direction are the shadows the shadows are two hours south yeah so the sun should be in the north so we should be in the southern hemisphere any any big rivers no big rivers here i mean it has to be either either africa or australia what else could it be it's not going to be like indonesia or anything it's too green for that some of these countries drive on the left side right but but again they are too green could it be india i mean the sun the sun can play tricks on you maybe it is something like india this is a big river but it doesn't really match so i think i'll remain in south africa hoping hoping that that it's not too far and we get some points at least let's go somewhere down here i don't no idea it was zimbabwe huh oh wow yeah yeah i mean i looked around there i just i didn't see it i guess i was expecting a little bit of a bigger bigger river oh there was victoria falls that's what it was okay victoria falls is a famous place i've heard of it i don't think i would have found it on the map even if i recognize it's victoria falls i don't think i would have found it this time i did not do that well let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges and on the right side there will be another satellite view video where you can play along huge thanks to all the patrons and members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ",

"https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/NxgbPryU50W0Caim"], "transcript": "in this gsr video we will be playing a map called an extraordinary cow this is a fun map made by king moo and his community and as the title suggests it contains locations with cows so we'll see a lot of cows here let's do a challenge one and a half minutes and no moving if you want to play along the links will be in the description just make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything so here are some cows cute cows to start it off with um i guess if you are a cow expert you can try to look like what what type of cow it is i have no idea i just see oh that's a cow that's all information i get from cows uh but i do recognize the google car this is the uh kenyan google car with the snorkel on one side so that's one of the easiest methods to to remember um i feel like that's one of the first methods that people learn and geo guests are either the kenyan snorkel or the ghana tape those are the two most common ones i feel uh but yeah this is kenya do we see any palm trees around by any chance we see some mountains i don't see any palm trees i usually use palm trees as indication how close we are to the coast because on the coast you often see the palm trees if you don't see them well you might be somewhere further further away from the coast uh these parts are quite hilly right in kenya so let's maybe guess near nakuru what's the road direction the road direction is pretty much south to south to north or maybe let's get somewhere here but but let's see okay more to the west more northwest but still um not a bad guys i'm pretty happy with my guess here less than 100 kilometers away good start good start now okay more cows obviously we're playing the cow map um these um houses feel very like uh al alpi and al i don't know in alps found in alps and we have is this generation two or it is generation two right yeah we do have the like in the circular blur in the sky as well so this is generation two if it was locom it would be switzerland but since this is generation two i'm thinking maybe something more like italy northern italy possibly yeah a lot of cows i feel like it could be very close to switzerland though because i'm getting very swiss vibes like such a such a beautiful landscape i would love to go here one day i haven't been been to switzerland before these mountain roads very beautiful uh so i would guess somewhere very northern italy because could this be france maybe might be france as well somewhere near where whichever country this is i feel like this should be close to switzerland so let's go maybe somewhere around here let's see let's guess here and then okay more more to the northeast i mean was closer to austria but not too far from switzerland as well so i was right about it being in alps just just could have wished for a little bit of a closer guest there but okay decent start decent decent start okay we have some cows these are some bigger cows very cute cows giving some milk uh we have we have a sign comunidad so two languages uh bilingual place so maybe like the national like some some official language and some minority language maybe which side are we driving on i'm not sure i think we're driving on the right side here but the car has crossed to the other side because of the cows so i i think we should are we trying the sign is hmm i'm confused what does it say here a little bit too far to see um comunidad sounds super spanish to me so i was thinking maybe spain this text is too small for me to read it for certain i'm very much not sure i was thinking could this be italy by any chance italy or spain call muni dad do i switch to italy okay let's switch to italy let's switch to italy ah why did i switch to italy i should really stop switching at the last second i like every time i do it i say afterwards i should not do it yet i keep doing it why do i keep switching commonly dad sounds so spanish oh my god oh okay anyways next round you have a great chance of beating me in this this challenge that's for sure we have some cows yes a lot of cows here these are some waffle poles i think yeah some waffle poles and these palm trees this i'm not sure i'm thinking something like cambodia i feel like i've seen some waffle poles in cambodia for those of you who don't know what waffle poles are well they are almost like holy poles except with they don't have holes they have kind of like indents that don't don't have a hole you know so you call them waffle poles there's a train coming as well dangerous uh but yeah i would say cambodia because these palm trees you see these kind of like bushy palm trees in cambodia thailand i think i've seen them them in brazil as well but in brazil the poles look different i think with these types of poles it i think it should be cambodia and the palm trees as well so let's go cambodia and then okay it was oh very close to the capital wow i wasn't thinking didn't look that uh that capitally but okay got the country right at least what do we have here uh looks like japan from the first glance let's have a look around yeah we are joining the left side the camera does feel quite low japan is is one of the countries that can have a low camera as as many of you probably know already uh can we find any phone numbers by any chance we studied the phone numbers on twitch stream a little time ago zero nine is that the area code zero nine if it is um i'm not sure if it is but if it is uh then it should be somewhere like zero nine it was like somewhere very like southern or was it even here um i'm not sure if it is the area code though because i think area codes are usually like separated so it might might not even be the area code could this be southern i mean it looks like it could be right why not japan is infamously difficult to figure out where you are japan looks very similar and the nuances are quite small to tell tell if whether it's it's like central japan or southern or northern um but i think i would go maybe not that southern maybe let's go just in case let's go somewhere like oita in case it's not that southern let's see okay it was it was southern so that's zero nine i guess it was that area code my first block was wake oh my god my first blank was super super close but okay this is also very good one a very good one how did i do in total 20 000 points pretty good if you enjoy these play along challenges press that like button leave a comment tell me what you like what you maybe don't like i always read all of the comments and and i do appreciate any feedback that you may give so next round we have another cow with a black and white pattern looking looking cool okay and more waffle poles this type of waffle pole feels more like french or or um or spanish yeah this these are spanish bollards with this yellow reflector and kind of kind of like a like like an indent as well in the bollard in the middle there and these are also the thick spanish signs the thick signs without the white border around so the red and red part looks quite big um yeah let's go spain where in spain doesn't feel i'm not sure to be honest let's go maybe somewhere somewhere around this area maybe doesn't feel very super northern doesn't feel very southern or western i don't know let's see how oh okay it was very northern i was wrong about that but still pretty pretty good score there 4 000 points okay now this this is a rough one wait where where is the cow wait where is the cow i don't see the cow where did where did we oh that's the cow hey that's a big one big chunky cow totally didn't notice it market street can we see this i mean it says speed limit so no surprise that this is america but albert the bull oh that's albert the bull i guess hello albert nice to meet you nice to meet you uh where could we be we i don't know the plates that well i'm not sure if we do have the front plate there or don't can't really tell we might it looks like we might not have the front plates there oh but these these houses do feel kind of nordic minoritic vibes so when i seen like a corner nordic feeling houses in um america it gives me like [Music] like northern northeastern vibes well i mean this isn't canada would this be something like vermont or maine even because of the nordic looking houses there let's go new hampshire there okay never mind it was iowa okay interesting i guess guess guessing kind of in the middle would have been much better decided to risk it but this time the risking it did not pay off unfortunately we have sun to the north first vibes is botswana let's look around if it is definitely feels like it here are the cows chilling in the shadow hiding from the sun this definitely gives me botswana vibes kind of like arid these yellow yellow side lines on the road the google car doesn't really help here we can't see it could be south africa as well what's the direction of the road let's see it goes like that so let's go kind of here maybe nor north of gaborone let's see okay it was even more north from gaborone quite more north still more than 4 000 points i'm happy with that i'm happy with that next on this feels europe european the road feels very estonian let's let's investigate the pole could be estonian you see these kind of interesting looking like wooden poles with a concrete bottom part in latvia and and sometimes in estonia this pole well one of the two this this type of road feels more estonian to me um kind of kind of this very narrow road [Music] and a lot lots of very greenery i feel like in estonia a lot of the times the green will be more vivid if it makes sense for some reason i feel the google camera could have turned up a vividness for in estonia a little bit for green so dystonia will feel more green sometimes and i feel this green feels very intense well we'll see if i'm right maybe i'm not but i would go estonia here with this road with the greenery and then the poles let's go kind of in the middle i guess not very hilly let's see kind of there more west okay but it was estonia so i was right about that that's nice and the last round here again these types of bushy bushy palm trees as i mentioned before they're common most common in cambodia thailand brazil could be some other countries as well i think but those are the most common ones let's see if it is one of them this does feel like cambodia doesn't it very kind of like um these these houses on stilts because of flood and and and although you can see them in some other countries too but they are very common in cambodia in particular also red soil cambodia does have a lot of red soil too so i am leaning towards cambodia right here okay these bollards i just noticed these bollards i'm pretty sure they are cambodian you don't see them very often but i'm pretty sure they were from cambodia and we have some cows of course that i kind of glanced over when we started the round so a lot of cute cows okay let's go cambodia ten seconds remaining uh i really don't know which part to guess here guess let's go again kind of maybe close to the capital let's see okay this time it was not as close to the capital as i would have wished for this time it was more north still on less than 100 kilometers away pretty good all in all i'm pretty happy with with other rounds besides the the us one let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges on the right side there will be another play along video where you can compete with me huge thanks all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ",

"you enjoy watching geogaster satellite view videos i enjoy making them so let's go for another one we'll be playing world cities with at least 1 000 population the play along link will be in the description just make sure you have the unity script installed otherwise the satellite view will not work and i was thinking let's maybe try to play five minutes per round let me know in the comments if you like this time limit or do you prefer playing without it i'm i'm open to suggestions uh let's see let's see what do we have we have a lot of agricultural fields out and this is coastal okay wow that looks so interesting every every square square meter feels like used productively from coast to coast there are fields everywhere which is is good but where would this be okay let's zoom in on the on this bigger city part here shadows go a little bit to the north so we should be in the northern hemisphere okay what is this ford ford field baseball field oh this is america with ford field and baseball field and then huge roads oh this is america little caesar's arena this is so america but where looks like a pretty big city in america with a a kind of like a lake and and okay and the river could this be one of the great lakes by any chance somewhere here detroit is it it is actually it is oh my god the first the first thing that i zoom in on it actually is stinging somewhere up here but yeah this this really this like river matches perfectly lake saint claire so where are we here someone suggested in the comments last time i should try to use the satellite view so uh i think yeah we can see this thingy i think that's it um somewhere down here let's try to find these roads maybe this is the barn they're kind of like here i think i hope let's see four meters let's go that's a good start that's a very good start let's move on okay another looks decently sized city smaller than detroit oh there's a bigger city here maybe this is a pretty red soil a big roundabout not sure not sure where are the shadows the shadows are a little bit to the south it seems so we should be in the southern hemisphere this time could be brazil maybe quite red soil which saturday are we driving on can we can we see yeah it looks like we're doing the right side here because of the stop line here i don't know if this is brazil or what else could this be could this possibly be africa i don't think this is africa i don't know the houses don't feel very african usually in africa their houses are not that close together i think uh but driving the right side so it isn't anything like australia or well at least it shouldn't be right quite a hilly hilly part hilly place southern hemisphere red soil driving on the right side watch it actually be africa oh there's a much bigger city oh my god i thought i thought it's like a snow or something on the mountain oh my god there's a much bigger city here oh my god i should have been focusing on that so are we we are definitely driving on the right side here yes oh my god i wasted so much time there oh wow this is a huge is this what is this place it's like an airport no what is this huh so many parking is this like a big supermarket so many parking spaces oh there is a runway even looking for an airport oh no i have no idea well one minute remaining at f-zero zero clue besides that i think it might be uh brazil but i feel like in brazil we would see some of those blue water containers that they have next to their houses i don't see any of those here well you have a good chance of doing better than than me on this route see wherever this is this is a very big city with all of these parking spaces and huge buildings everywhere i don't think it's san paolo oh somewhere here i know this part of brazil is quite like hilly right terrain i mean this part is quite hilly bellow horizon okay okay not that bad it actually was brazil not too far from where i went i mean almost 1200 kilometers but still 2 000 points i'll gladly take it yeah so this was that big city that we were looking at well i thought that big city might have been something like bellow horizontal or something to hear but okay could could definitely could be worse right definitely could be worse oh no okay now this looks difficult now this looks difficult let's zoom out there is a river going through and that's that's that's the big clue here zooming on the city now these houses feel like they might be african maybe or maybe southeast asia because they are a little bit like spaced apart from each other i feel like that's more common in africa which said are we driving on again and can we tell it looks like we're driving the right side here aren't we i think we are driving on the right side yeah is that a bigger city or you can't see it might be a bigger city but it's a little bit out of our uh reach if i had to guess right now i would guess africa which country trying on the right side so it's probably well it shouldn't be any of these southern countries it could be something like don't know cameroon there are some mountains to our west i mean there are some mountains here could we could we be somewhere here ish no i don't think so i don't think it's anywhere here like there are no no big mountains like this right if it is actually africa it would be somewhere well either here or or or maybe more central i'm starting to think this might not be africa driving on the right side something like laos could it be loss it looks quite different these these mountains look very different from what we have here it's okay i don't think it's there anymore or somewhere here but we'll be driving in the left side then i think i'll stay in africa but i have no idea where since we're driving on the right side i would go [Music] i think let's let's go with cameroon i think that's that's my best bet here let's let's let's hope it's not like like something like south it was okay it was south america i kind of dismissed south america there oh there was the river that borders between colombia and venezuela okay i guess with more time i maybe could have found it maybe a relatively big city that is those are just agricultural fields there is a big city here as well though um so where is the sun so shadows go to the north so we are in the northern hemisphere some houses feel very european i'm thinking this this could be europe for sure thinking something like um somewhere in the area from germany to hungary poland czechia somewhere here maybe uh we are driving the right side right can we just check yes we are it looks like we are driving the right side if we zoom out what what significant features do we see nothing much nothing much really there is a small lake on the left side here i highly doubt that we would be able to find it a lot of agricultural fields very long ones which is interesting there is a river going through okay let's maybe try to find a big big european city that has the river with like a 90 degree angle like that that looks quite unique um it's not war so no uh the river i mean we can maybe follow the river river of vistula let's follow there is like a 90 degree angle here but no it that doesn't fit now almost but not really frankfurt is the closest one yet in terms of the river let's maybe have a look from the satellite view how does frankfurt look like less red roofs than than we want krakow let's check out krakow wait is is oh my god it actually is seriously okay where is the dot the dot is oh my god what the hell we have 17 seconds remaining oh my dear lord krakov oh freaking hell oh my god i know i found it way too late i found it way too late it's somewhere here ish oh my god oh my god i somehow found krakow literally like with 30 seconds remaining yeah okay i kind of panicked there for a second but still 6.8 kilometers away i think that's a great score so my initial assessment was right we were in this area somewhere like germany poland area okay okay i mean with more time obviously i would have 5k but i feel personally that the time limit makes it more exciting because you don't know will you find it won't you will you not find it but let me know in the comments how you like this this time limit and press that like button if you enjoy these satellite view videos so so i know to make more of them there is a river big river here quite a draw dry looking west part kind of almost like a desert still there are some roads i'm thinking something like middle east maybe iran i don't know is there a river like this going through iran let's let's check iran don't see a big river okay maybe okay let's let's turn back to satellite view let's maybe watch where it kind of maybe the color is matched to this egypt could this be nile could this be nile no not real it doesn't feel like nile does it because it feels way too dry around nile it's either very green or very dry no no in between it feels like there's kind of kind of some middle parts there probably somewhere here the color kind of matches is there a river here just just the nile okay let's go back to the default view maybe we can spot some it looks like a pretty big river i don't know maybe somewhere here ish i just realized i didn't even look at the city properly i just went for for the um for the river immediately i should have checked out the driving side at least where are the shadows the shadows are a little bit to the north yeah okay so we are in the northern hemisphere and we are driving the right side so so okay i wouldn't have really learned anything new there thinking maybe somewhere here but we have 20 seconds remaining it's it's not like i'm gonna find anything that i haven't seen already in these 20 seconds i think this is this is pretty close i think so maybe it's somewhere along this river but that that's the best i have somewhere in syria oh it was sudan okay so it what it was the nile okay yeah yeah okay so i i guess i should have followed the nile more to the south thirteen thousand two hundred points in total could be better could be better i'm very proud of my first and fourth rounds uh the other ones the second one was okay let me know in the comments how did you do in this challenge and on the right side there will be another play along video in this satellite view huge thanks to all of the patrons and youtube members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see in the next video ", "image_not_available": [5], "images_path":

"welcome back to another geographer video where we'll be looking at the locations from the top using the satellite view last time i played the capital cities of the world map this time we'll be playing world cities with at least 1k population so it should be more difficult because smaller cities and more possibilities as well right so you can play along the descriptions are right here on the map's description and the link to play along will be in the description so let's go uh what do we have here uh we have a baseball field that's the first thing that i noticed we have a baseball field so probably not europe uh us has a lot of baseball fields right um does india play baseball as well i'm not sure about that i know baseball is coming some other places as well but mostly us looks like the central line might be yellow which would fit with the us possibly and it does appear we are driving on the right side of the road which also would fit with the us are these school buses these orange ones school buses or trucks maybe we have very big roads in both directions soil is super red i just noticed it's extremely red or even brown uh in some places what are these circles what okay maybe this isn't us i don't know where do they use such an agricultural like method like this i guess it makes sense like like rotating different crops in different seasons probably but i've never seen like circles like this being used that's really interesting oh are we we are on a we're on an island oh okay is this wait okay i i didn't even zoom out and didn't realize that this is quite possibly an island uh very populated island it's like we have uh agricultural fields and cities all over the place there's even a much bigger one here on this coast i don't i don't like coasts in the regular regular g i guess sir i like coastal cities in this mode because it really narrows it down a lot let's look around at some caribbean islands at first and maybe we can find um something that fits this uh like like i don't know not really a golf this this water entry it seems quite unique so hopefully that that this this might help us oh oh oh i think i found it okay that was quick so it was in caribbean as i suspect that it it looks like this city is havana and and we are not really in havana we are more in the middle of cuba or in this city i'm guessing yeah we have a baseball field here and we are to the left of the baseball field like two two big streets crossing like that here this this might be the intersection and we are like here i think let's guess okay good start good start let's go for the next round okay i i don't it's a lot of roundabouts this country likes their roundabouts and it isn't very green if you zoom out well we can see some green greenness but it looks like most of the country is quite arid and mountainous so this is like a mountainside city city on a mountain oh okay which side are we driving on we are driving on the right side it seems the sun the shadows are going north so sun is to our south so it should be in the northern hemisphere oh wow if we look more south east we have a much much bigger city here let's let's investigate whoa very high buildings as well damn this is a huge city okay i mean that might that should help right very weird city planning we have very huge houses here then some fields and again huge houses looks like here some factories in the middle of the city a power plant i honestly don't know i'm thinking india maybe no but we're driving on the right side so it wouldn't be india you know i was thinking like i don't know somewhere tajikistan uzbekistan they have some mountains here i imagine they might look like this from above maybe to do we have any water the shamba has a river going there but there is a there is a river going through oh very green around the river makes sense so there is a small river but it's not dushanbe though let's see maybe we can find something i'm confused i'll be honest i'm not sure if this is even asia i was thinking somewhere in this area but we have mountains to our north is there a small river going somewhere here there is a small river go wait is it actually okay let's let's investigate there is like a huge huge intersection in the northern part of the city i mean okay there are a lot of intersections here that doesn't help uh how do i confirm that this is the uh if this is the might not be i'm really not sure the more i look at it the more i think that it isn't tehran i just wish it was but i don't think it is okay i think this is the road i think this is that big intersection here okay so it was okay it wasn't tehran it was karja oh my god so how how big is the [Music] i guess we can see tehran like on the very very edge here oh my god if this is karja then how huge is tehran what the hell okay we have a small well small this still is a pretty big intersection small compared to the previous one that we had small but big intersection [Music] that leads to that city let's try to follow the road okay let's try to follow the road so we are exiting garage on this road okay so we go go go up until here then we go up until this intersection here oh this is that intersection oh oh here it is so it is way before quas uh cosmin okay took me a while but but i got there i got there uh we have so we are on this road how far there should be a turn here that's that's the turn so we are right right here okay let's go let's go another another perfect score let's hope we continue just as well this looks more difficult though to be honest we have some green mountains here some very high looking mountains too we are in a city yeah and this looks like a european city we have very red roofs or orange roofs very uniform roofs we have a basketball court yeah everything like the roads the houses everything feels european to me europe very high mountains well not latvia we can exclude latvia good to know good to know where could this be though we have a river going here as well we have a river mountains fields everything we need could this be like slovenia or austria or germany sweet would switzerland have these houses italy maybe italy italy might be a good shout there's some big highways here so there are a couple of cities around there are a couple of rivers around and there are a couple of highways around and i still don't know which country we are in i am thinking maybe poland maybe but i'm not sure if the mountains would fit really poland if it is poland it should be like southern part somewhere i was looking at north hungary this thing maybe the red roofs would fit hungary but better we have like two rivers coming together here maybe that's helpful maybe let's let's look for that i'm looking at i can't under there are some similarities i'm currently in albania i mean there are some similarities but no no no that that's not the river i feel like i've looked all over europe that was my last last hope it was kind of similar but but no it wasn't it i feel like the looking for the river was our best bet here unfortunately i i couldn't find it well i'll quickly glance over still but uh yeah either i have overlooked it or it is too small for me to find i was looking belgrade uh kind of looks similar but no also doesn't fit i think i'll go guess somewhere in this area thinking maybe it's somewhere here but i think this is the first one well where i i don't get a perfect score it was north macedonia so i wasn't too far oh my god how small are those rivers oh my god yeah yeah no shot i would have found them wait the other one where's oh that's the other one oh my god you're no shot so tiny yeah yeah no way i would have found those rivers okay but still 3800 points definitely not too bad okay we have this looks like a big river oh we are on is this a coast this looks like it is a coast yeah okay so good good start so we are on a coast looks like a very big city very big city might even be capital possibly i don't know where is the sun going where is this no that's not a baseball field is it that is a baseball field so okay we might be in the us maybe now where are the shadows going the shadows are going to the north so we should be in the northern hemisphere potentially in the us let's have a look at the roads what do we see we are driving on the left side okay um drawing the left side what is this what kind of a sports is that i'm not entirely sure let's let's have a look if anything fits we have a pretty big river like almost two rivers here that merge into one very interesting looking river actually two two entries and they they both unite maybe this is one of the pacific islands maybe but again the sun should we should be in the northern hemisphere wet center lines northern hemisphere driving on the left side could this ever be japan maybe why not i guess i mean i don't see a reason why it couldn't be japan let's let's have a look maybe maybe it fits oh yes yes it is japan actually okay yeah this river fits perfectly these these two two entryways yeah yeah yeah this is it and so it is uh japan we are basically east of these these deltas is that how whether they they are called river deltas and if you are enjoying these type of videos press that like button uh let the youtube and me know that you like them and you want to see more we are a little bit east of this river so somewhere here is yeah so do we see the these roads we have this horizontal road and this road i think we are somewhere here there is a small river again yeah yaya and we are right here in this parking lot i guess yeah that does look like a parking lot and we should be right here yes seven meters okay oh man let's go for the last uh around let's zoom out okay coast i like coasts ghosts are good uh well not necessarily easy but easier easier than inland locations in my opinion at least so let's investigate let's investigate uh what the quality is definitely not the best it looks like we're driving the left side because of this like stop line because it is on the left side it appears that we are driving on the left side again i was thinking it looks kind of european but i mean i was thinking it looks kind of uk-ish looking at this this like or irish possibly looking at this like shape and then relief and and i was thinking it could be could be one of one of these islands possibly could it be somewhere here because ireland does look like very similar the western part um is that oh it is that actually oh it is actually it oh my god yeah yeah it is it is it okay this i think this is the first time that i actually recognize it just purely by the tape of of the the island itself instead of uh the cities so now we have to pinpoint where we are we are okay somewhere here this is a very interesting coast very interesting co looking coast so we are east of there castle bar orient castle bar we might be we have like two lakes yeah yeah we have this long one and then there is a small river oh that's a road never mind mistaken road for a river so we have this road here are we in this on this intersection um i think we are yeah i think i think this should be it let's go let's go oh another perfect so in total i think we did really really well the third round was super difficult i spent so much time looking for those rivers they turned out to be super small i don't know how else i could have found this particular city on the right side of the screen i think you will enjoy the previous satellite view video that i did in the capitals of the world huge thanks to all of the patrons and members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see in the next video ",

every next challenge they become more and more difficult and quickly before we get to the challenges i want to say huge thank you to portuguese who is a big supporter of mine on patreon and makes all of this possible thank you very much the first challenge of the video is going to be in a map called geodetective which is designed to have locations which are relatively easily findable it's designed to be played no moving but we will be playing it with moving around and three minutes on the clock challenge links is always in the description make sure to play it before watching this video and you can play along with a free account as well in case you didn't know oh but okay we cannot even move around in this location even if you wanted to uh no access authorized authorized reasons only where are we we are some sort of a lighthouse i'm getting scottish vibes do we have yellow license plates i'm not it looks like it might be yellow there it looks like we might have some english something only well we had english here as well so i think we are in scotland and i think the compass should be aligned properly usually in these types of maps the compass is the map maker make sure that compass works correctly so let's see so we have a lighthouse to our east and some some land water and land to north and only water to our east okay let's have a look i'm getting big scottish vibes here so could we be somewhere here water only watered or east some water and land to the north there is a lighthouse i don't know if that's the one don caspi head lighthouse would that work i don't know if that works i don't know whether that works would it be some there are so many lighthouses here that's the thing i'm thinking it might be this one but i'm very much not sure i'm not sure if it aligns properly let's see let's i'll think i'll guess here okay good it was that lighthouse i wasn't sure if it aligns properly luckily it did we have uh spanish flags i don't i'm not very good at flags but i recognize the spanish one when i see it uh nico hotel and uh petrol station okay that might be helpful for pinpointing ah adradas and madrid well not sure about adradas but i know where madrid is madrid is to our the road goes goes goes goes goes goes sort of to our south i think like it takes a turn or oh wait yeah adradas is to our north madrid appears to be to our south so where is adradas can we find adradas or road n111 so e90 is here and one one [Music] where is n111 i can't find wrote n111 and adradas which is terrible if i found one of them then surely i could find oh my god the time ran out ah where was adradas n111 i see n11 where the hell is that road n111 oh my god you need to zoom in so close to find it oh seriously and adradas where is adradas could i have found that i still don't see adradath i didn't i didn't realize that the time is about to run out i wouldn't have guessed that far east i would not have good i i shouldn't have been plonked there oh oh well what can you do a kind of a fumble by me but but let's let's keep going this is a chilean flag well first of all i kind of remember where puerto natales is but this also feels very very southern in chile puerto natales i think was somewhere down here puerto natales here it is puerto natales paso don guillermo i don't know where that is puerto natales is to our south or or or where uh west south or west and we are on a roundabout okay let's move around a little bit since we can maybe we can find something useful cerro castillo is to our east wait what oh no oh no ret and cerro castillo do we enter cerro castillo here is this this roundabout i think it might actually be yeah it kind of aligns but where do we start right here i think yeah i think we are we should be here okay nice found it at the last second basically okay that's french south is also french um okay so we're in france saint mark alps oh over overni roan maybe that that might be the place name but let me sell ss alps so i'm thinking it might be somewhere near alps maybe hopefully okay let's have a look around maybe we find something helpful else something else helpful where would there be a saint mark cathedral well they have so many cathedrals could be anywhere really saint mark wait is saint mark a city wait is saint mark maybe a city or no oh no where is it okay i'm almost out of time where is it i was leon okay i didn't say it saying leon anywhere because sometimes i just don't notice things on map uh we have is this what's the car is this senegal or yeah we do have rifts in the sky as well yeah this is senegal we have blue plates as well you get blue license plates in senegal um so we are in senegal on a roundabout near a big river near a bridge to a big on a big river uh could it be could we be in the car are there any big rivers in the car not that i can see any big rivers this is a big river and here is a bridge um but this doesn't look right there are no roundabouts any other big rivers there's a big river here and this could be it there is a roundabout um does it align we have bridge to our kind of west yeah yeah yeah it does a line i don't see anything to confirm it but i think it aligns perfectly doesn't it i think this road aligns perfectly i'm fairly certain that we should be right here yep it was there so three of the rounds i got a perfect score two of the rounds not so much not so much the second challenge which should be a little bit more difficult and the first one is gonna be in a diverse world the the standard map for playing geoguessr and it is gonna be one minute no moving again link in the description good luck everyone okay we have a car immediately visible oh this car uh this car with these black and yellow stripes uh you can see it in abuja and basically not only abuja but from abuja to ibadan on a road so it could be abuja could be somewhere along there do we see something helpful here not really we have a police car following us looks pretty green i think in a butcher they might what would a butcher be this green i'm not sure i don't know i don't think a puja would be this green would it maybe oh do i switch it last second let's switch to akure should i should i have switched no it was abuja ah no okay i guess abuja can be that green i know generally the more north in nigeria go the drier it gets i thought maybe abuja would be drier than that but okay i should stop switching at last second but usually it doesn't end well can we have a black google car okay look spanish speaking uh generally first thought was bolivia but but because of the black car i'm thinking peru may because peru can be quite similar to bolivia now do we see any electricity counters yeah these are peruvian electricity counters with these long rectangles these long horizontal rectangle electricity counters you see in peru it's not super dry this part of peru is quite dry as far as i know let's maybe go more so like i i uh ch maybe i don't know if we see city here anywhere um not that i recognize any of these names as a city name so let's let's keep it somewhere there it was more north okay let's move on okay we're in canada in canada it says maximum plus we use kilometers an hour uh in in the us it would be miles so we're somewhere in canada uh beyond that i am not sure where oh junction 62. that's a local road i feel like it might be eastern part somewhere 62 we're not gonna find 62 are we it was like on a shield i don't know if that shield helps in any way maybe they use shields in some provinces only i'm not not a big canada expert unfortunately do they use shields here oh okay not a bad guess actually i just plonked it near otawa it was oh yeah 62 kind of a shield shape here okay not bad i think this is a pretty good score especially for such a huge country as canada i am happy with that oh the fourth round here uh we have rectangular signs double yellow lines i think this sign looks like one that might have a colombian cross there because we see these bolts here on this sign like the i think that's a bolt as well and we might have one there which would indicate that we have a cross on the other side and as you know in columbia science often has this white cross we call colombian cross we are running out of time as i am explaining all this all we are quickly running out of time uh i would guess somewhere here in this this well most of the columbia is quite mountainous here so i'm guessing somewhere around there maybe okay it was colombia really pretty good guess i would say and let's go for the last round again latin america it looks like it we have this small antenna which excludes some of the countries uh do we see the plates the yellow plates again so this is columbia again is in columbia they have yellow plates uh do we have the city somewhere here oh it even says colombia here [Music] maybe one of those words is a city but if it is i don't recognize it uh or don't see it let's okay um this i don't think it's bogota let's go let's go pare pereira pereira or medalling kali maybe ah it was very north oh i was i was quite off quite off here or sanya is that how you say it okay i guess it did look kind of northern to be fair let's view the summary still 20 000 points i'm pretty happy with that and the last challenge of this video will be the most difficult one which will be in a rural world which contains rural locations and let's have 30 seconds no moving panning and zooming so the image that we see at the start is the one that we base our guesses on oh okay yeah as expected it's gonna be difficult if generation two camera looks i'm not even sure if this is europe to be fair it looks like it might be europe something like uk possibly but uh i am very much not sure i'm thinking uk france somewhere in this area maybe could be something completely different as well let's have a look it was france okay not too bad not too bad i was kind of in the right ballpark oh it was okay never mind it was belgium well still still the right ballpark i did say around this area um okay next round we have an antenna with this small tape i'm not sure which country it was i think it might be hungary could be bulgaria could be czechia um i'm not sure i think it's czechia let's switch to czechia might be hung one of those three countries for sure i think it was it was awesome okay slovakia never mind no wasn't any of those three countries around the same area it looked like a winter coverage and winter coverage is more common in czechia than in slovakia but okay still 4 000 points oh no okay this is a tricky one i am in between like colombia and the philippines maybe maybe something else even oh no i think i will go with colombia ecuador possibly somewhere in this area let's go let's go around there i was there it was philippines ah well as i said i did consider philippines but i chose the wrong option unfortunately there fourth round what is this now we have these um oh my god what did you call them those boxes on the poles i always forget how you call them i don't know mexico guatem i don't think guatemala could this be mexico or colombia or let's go mexico philippines again are you kidding me philippines is destroying me what the hell come on come on philippines is this philippines now is this philippines oh it could be we have cows and big pump i don't think i've ever seen cows with palm trees together uh where i'm getting asian vibes is this philippines might as well go philippi uh i really don't know it could be something like i don't know something like indonesia maybe i don't know with palm trees like this maybe swish oh too late to switch time is time has run out oh it was philippines again oh my god what the hell three philippines i guess i'm lucky i guess philippines again oh my god are you kidding me that's ridiculous three philippines in a row let me know in the comments how you did in these challenges and on the right side there will be another play along video i think you will enjoy again huge thanks to portuguese and all the other patrons and youtube members for the generous support i

white hat which contains a lot of interesting and funny locations with a guy with a white hat so let's go the play along links as always will be in the description and make sure to press that like button if you enjoy these play along videos let's see what is the first location and okay we have the white uh the white hat guy right ahead so this time it was easy to find him is that him as well or is that a different guy no that's a different guy with a white hat basically in every location in this map somewhere this guy will be located which is a really funny concept uh we don't have much time remaining this feels like somewhere in the u.s maybe not sure where i'm i'm thinking maybe somewhere like new mexico area maybe let's see let's get somewhere around there not bad not bad it was new mexico it was arizona but not far i'm very happy with 415 points that's a good start let's see yeah i have i have tried to avoid this map before i have seen some locations and i thought they were super funny so i didn't play it didn't watch it to keep my reactions genuine so we have uh the guy of course again looking right at the camera there's some blue plates i'm not sure where they are from republic of molossia elevation what are nortons okay i'm so confused population 35 so we have english republic of molossi i've never heard of it molossia what are nortons what what what kind of measurement is more norton souvenirs curious supplies is this la paz la paz it says la paz there but there are many different languages would this really be la paz oh god it was u.s i just saw la paz i went with la paz didn't think much of it i mean i thought maybe it's a touristy place that's why all the signs are in in english what the hell was that place molossian government office maybe you know someone in the comments can explain what the hell is molossia is that like some regional government in the us never heard of it before well not what wasn't the best round let's see a lot of u.s flags again well i'm guessing this map probably contains predominantly us locations but i think there probably there should be some other ones as well okay this is the white hat guy we found him what is this illinois okay i usually don't i don't like the design of the flags with the text on it but they can be very helpful when it comes to geoguessing if it says illinois right there and this is a chicago flag right i'm pretty sure pretty sure so we are on the coast there is a lighthouse there that we can see muntu dance theater east stage on we're basically right next to some big building big building lighthouse could that be the lighthouse lincoln park no yeah if i had a bit more time i possibly could have found it but i'm still pretty happy with this oh yeah chicago harbor lighthouse yeah i definitely could have found it with more time but i'm still happy that i got chicago and then pretty close as well oh this is cool is this the us again okay where is the guy where is the guy with the white hat where is he hiding where is the guy hiding i found him found the guy uh okay is this the u.s again we don't see any flags but the architecture and everything feels it might be the u.s again we have a palm tree so probably quite southern i don't see any texts i don't see anything really um that could help i'm assuming u.s and maybe let's go something like georgia florida somewhere jax let's go jacksonville somewhere there ah completely the other side of the u.s oh god that's unfortunate was it san francisco it was san francisco it was music music concourse okay [Laughter] oh my god this is such a funny concept uh okay this is i'm i'm guessing u.s again i don't know i don't know if there's only you there are only u.s locations or or not but up until now all of the locations have been in the u.s so i'll probably guess u.s again because that seems to be most likely this feels a bit more northern than the previous one so maybe let's go something like colorado maybe seems kind of like a mountainous region i know colorado is quite mountainous so let's go somewhere there maybe seriously seriously it was the netherlands well i guess that confirms that the there could be other locations besides the us good to know it didn't look like the netherlands to me but but yeah ah the first few rounds were so promising uh the first one and the third one the other ones not so much not so much but let's go for another one again link of course in the description what is this one now cadillac ranch well this is probably us again route 66 definitely us um where wonderland amusement park does it say well even if it says the state it's so blurred out that i can't see oh must follow 40 is that interested 40 interested 40 so the 40s here it is yeah so the 40s here basically they go horizontally but it obviously it's a big injury state so looking at the nature oh there's the the head guy i totally forgot about the white hat guy i get so focused on the on the on geo guessing okay it was amarillo some more to the east it was texas okay but still pretty happy with this guess pretty close uh let's continue okay there is the white hat guy there um okay okay this this feels like the netherlands this feels like the netherlands we have yellow plates we know that there is at least one other location in the netherlands so probably the same trip that he was uh he he took to the netherlands the previous one in the netherlands was somewhere here-ish right so maybe this one let's go nearby as well there's a river there is a river so maybe let's get near this river somewhere el elberg or something let's go somewhere there it was just near amsterdam ah unfortunate unfortunate thought it might be might have been somewhere nearby the last one okay what is this the guy i think this is the guy with a white hat standing with his back this time we have an amusement park okay oh there is there is he again damn there are two two of him anymore i didn't see any more this is such a funny concept i love it uh this is is this uh oh that's a californian flag that's the californian flag i actually was thinking uh florida at first so i'm glad i noticed that flag san francisco or los angeles let's go los angeles maybe something like long beach somewhere i don't know where where there are any amusement parks there santa monica pier okay um there are some some ferris wheels and stuff okay not too bad i'm glad i went with the right city at least big city but still the correct one las vegas las vegas las vegas well could we be in las vegas mgm well more las vegas okay where is the white hat guy where where is he hiding there is the statue of the lib of liberty where is the white hat guy hiding though there he is oh very sneaky i almost didn't notice him uh but okay so this is a las vegas mgm i've heard of mgm before some some mgm because mgm grand here it is some sort of a casino right grand casino this looks like a pretty big big intersection with a big lion there could it be this intersection maybe what are we looking at here okay didn't have time to confirm it but it was a 5k i'm happy with that oh this one is loading a while again oh this feels like it could be around new mexico or or uh arizona somewhere there where is the guy with a hat where is he hiding oh okay there he is we don't see the hat though oh i was thinking maybe maybe it's up there it actually is okay uh let's go again i'm thinking somewhere around here again let's go arizona somewhere like around here maybe ah it was oh it was even more to the west it was california this time i am way way more happy with this game than the first one that's for sure on the right side you will find another funny play along video go and check it out huge

"in this geographer video i will be trying to get a perfect score in a map called i saw the sun and you can play along the link will be in the description this map contains locations with some place visible right where we start so it should be possible to get a decent score hopefully a perfect one we will be playing with moving and yeah as i mentioned the link is in the description just make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything okay we have a denmark i think this feels like very much like a danish sign this is a danish sign as well a denmark is a pretty good country to try to get a good score but of course i would need to move around roskilde museum so okay we could use that to try to later pinpoint it what do we have roskilde roskilde roskilde might be the place name the city name that we are in because i see a lot of roskilde of course danish flags as well ros roskill the museum i don't know i've never heard of roskilde so i think it i don't know how large it is seems like a pretty decently sized city i mean let's let's maybe try to find roski all day oh here it is oh my god here it is uh ross killed the museum okay how i had not heard of roskilde before but it seems like a pretty big city roskill the museum the museum is also pretty easy to notice we are basically right where exactly like here is there a small small road here somewhere is this the small road i guess that's the small road so we are a little bit to this side okay good start one meter off let's hope all the other locations are just as easy [Music] well that sounds very german the language um this is not generation 2 so it can't be germany so probably austria i would say let's have a look what do we have messer frauenhofen i've heard of frauenhofen before i think i've had it before well when playing geoguessr and yeah these are austrian signs messiah and frauenhofen let's let's try to find one of them yeah i don't think i can find any of them i might be missing something as you know i'm i'm quite often terrible at finding things on maps i just always miss something it would be nice to find what city are we in right now stutthorn i don't think horde wait horn i said horn we had horn right where we started horn i guess that's the city name start means city so city of horn this doesn't seem like a big city though but i can try to find horn maybe oh horn is here okay frauenhofen perfect okay so this should be it is throwing hoffen is two kilometers away it is very close to this horn um so we started next to i don't know what this place is uh uh bezier manshaft germans really like to stitch the words together that's why they they have so long words because they just take two nouns put them together boom we have a new word what's the road direction let's let's start with that maybe um it is okay quite quite vertical with vertical with there seems to be a pretty big intersection here no no not as big as i thought it was there is a little okay can we find okay there is a little here is there a turn there is a turn okay so we are somewhere here was this the uh triangular intersection or this isn't a triangular one though is this this is the one probably yeah yeah yeah and yeah here is the bezier thingy okay so we are here let's go let's go good good good continuation so we are in czechia these are these signs are unique to czechia with these arrows so yes we are in czechia for sure road 367 we could i think we can use that to uh try to find it let's have a look at the check road numbering system 367 so 30 is here 3 6 36 is here 367 should be somewhere around here ish i think 368 oh god where is 367 369 where is 367 366 oh my god i'm finding everything besides 367 i quite literally found all the other roads besides three six seven maybe let's try to find any of these city names in this area and cromerich are the furthest ones so maybe they might be the biggest ones you can't i don't see those cities either um maybe we can find what city we are in currently okay what's that oh i saw quasita on one of the signs i didn't realize that that's a city name in latvian class is like a like a drink look like a type of a drink pretty tasty maybe road 367 is completely in a different place it would make no sense though all the other three six eight three six nine three six sixes are in here what is this 55 okay that's something else where the hell is 55 now 20 where's where are 50s 50 50 57 56 not again okay 55. okay can we find any of these cities and this radished that's something at least 25 kilometers to our north is there wait what oh there is another there's a red 55 why is this red suddenly is huh why is this 55 red and this 55 blue amount is this the red one supposed i'm so confused give prayer of and hulin is to our north as well supposedly hulin okay we have hule in here ulin where the hell is 367 finally are you kidding me and i think this is the turn probably quasita we started in quakita right oh my dear lord i think we're somewhere here auto parts store was that auto parts store i guess it is an auto parts store huh auto service quasita i think we are like here right okay thank god finally this took so long oh no this is this indonesia oh no indonesia can be a hustle to 5k that's for sure i have no idea what which one of is the city rapura semarapura well let's pray several is decently sized otherwise i might spend a lot of time here i don't see semarapura anywhere guys i'm sorry i think we'll need to go around and try try to find some more clues maybe if you are enjoying this video though or for all of my suffering press that like button it really helps uh to reach more people i seek lung again bali oh bali that's okay okay okay okay so bali column so bali is here oh i thought i found a struck a gold mine but maybe not why does it say bali there if it isn't in bali okay even if it isn't bali maybe i should try to look for kulung kung somewhere oh my god okay let's keep going where the hell is [Music] i know it said bali but i can't find any of these place names in bali and maybe that sign was advertising something in bali are we actually in bali because i was looking in bali before i couldn't find any any of those are you kidding me here it is oh my god okay how did i miss it before what the hell it's not even that small how do i keep missing these places all the time seriously okay we are right next to junior high school um let's hope it's at least the junior high school is easy to find smp negeti 2 is that the road name or is is this the high school i mean it is marked as a school but no it's smp not sma i have no idea what that means but it's not the same smp here we go okay i think that's it again it doesn't say if it is the the high school or not does the road align sort of yeah there is a turn up there this road is quite twisty and turny i think this is but is there a road here is there a road here is that the road i have no idea what the hell is happening here we have like some taco skylink we have tocco skylink here skylink something we have here i just now realized the children are driving these uh teens i guess are driving these mopeds and motorcycles to school that's why there are so many of them that's crazy well i guess we are somewhere here no okay i think i'll guess somewhere here is that enough oh it has enough 18. okay we were more to the south that we were on that intersection okay okay oh good enough luckily oh god so last round please be easy usa oh yay yay okay let's hope we can find the state uh quickly or maybe this is canada i don't know then a yellowish plate chamber of commerce terrace terrace guest terrace is the um place name scotiabank so i guess this is canada doesn't mean that this is nova scotia though even though we have a scotiabank i think i've seen it all over the place if my memory doesn't let me down you have the canadian flag i have a very faded oh god what was that i was studying canadian flags and i don't remember what the hell was this province flag if only i did right there are some pretty big hills oh i'm thinking could ha could that have been british colombia's flag maybe that is possible with these hills it certainly feels like it might be like bank of monreal i think i've seen bank of monreal also all over the place it doesn't mean that we are in monreal so terrace let's see if we can find terrace in british columbia maybe that's a decently sized terrace oh my god okay um where did we start there's terrace hearing clinic there is hearing clinic um [Music] okay and the road goes like that so somewhere here maybe terrace okay let's maybe try to find some more clues terrace hearing clinic isn't enough we have a an intersection with some road road names and road numbers that that's what that could be that could be helpful uh la kelsey and atwood la kelsey and atwood la kelsey avenue i was thinking it kind of aligns but i didn't see the the clinic atwood where is atwood atwood district chain i remember chamber of commerce i remember seeing chamber of commerce where was it here it is yeah chamber of commerce so we're somewhere on this this section somewhere here i don't see any any hearing uh clinics here interior work something okay interior workplace yes that is it do we see any houses here there's this house here and we are a little bit to the um west of it yes so it should be somewhere around here okay let's go so i got a new badge i got a perfect score oh let me know in the comments how did you do in this challenge if you got a perfect score how long did it take it took me 51 minutes in total so oh if you enjoyed this map check this video on the right side where i play it as well huge thanks to all of the patrons and members for supporting this channel i hope y'all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/JVr57Ifz2s9aiVAP"],

which contains locations of supposedly dads in various interesting situations the challenge links as always will be in the description you can play along with the free account as well and let's play no moving just make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything this map assumes that everyone we see are dads so that that's the assumption um so this is denmark with these signs on some yellow license plates some white license plates we are somewhere in denmark uh i don't see is there a city name here i don't think there is i don't speak danish i don't think any of these words is a city name oh we have a domain name as well dot dk yeah i don't see any any um location names so let's guess around here maybe not bad not too bad not too far from audience got the right island nice one what will be the next dad the next dad is just sitting here talking to a lady nice we have generation two camera a pole like this what's the license we don't see the license plate this is definitely southern europe i um i am thinking if this is spain or portugal i can't tell the pole i would say portugal the pole feels more portuguese with nature like this with the nature like this i would maybe go somewhere here even more north it was near braga the middle of nowhere some very small village next that is just walking along the road with a small shopping bag okay okay we have the uh long antenna cyrillic probably russia i would imagine i don't see any any non-russian letters the license plates also look completely white after the ruse also a good clue telephone the question is if we will be able to find some uh location names which i don't think there are any this map isn't designed to be played for high score this is just a fun map to look at some supposed dads around the world and their encounters where in russia could this be yeah no idea no idea which city this is uh ufa shall we go ufa let's go ufa oh wow it was very northern it was uh i didn't even know that ukta has coverage to be honest i know there is some coverage in vorkuta but usually like this area in russia there is almost no coverage there that's why usually most people guess around this southern part because the biggest cities and the most coverage is is there so what are these dads doing pretty young dads um oh they are they are um what do what do you call it in english paving it it's not painting is it paving well making the wall i don't know let me know in the comments what's the name uh we have a polish sign with this very narrow red border again of course no no no city names no no road numbers nothing like that maybe somewhere here ish so south south eastern poland maybe let's see if i am right oh that was completely wrong i thought it was southeast it was north west so so well at least i got the country but guess definitely could have been better okay this dad is just chilling in the chair oh god how do you call these chairs oh no my english is not on point today swiveling chair is that the word but yeah the dad is just chilling this is unofficial coverage um the author's name is sablizu um i don't think that helps us in determining the country i'm getting like pakistani vibes maybe maybe somewhere in that area maybe afghanistan i'm feeling maybe somewhere there oh why am i zooming in on europe i don't know islamabad shall we go islamabad kind of in the middle just in case it's like india or maybe we go afghanistan it's more like closer to tajikistan in case it is there i think i'll go afghanistan but it might be pakistan as well and it was tajikistan indeed so good that i i went with uh kabul it's a little bit closer than islamabad so i was thinking somewhere in this area well felt like the architecture style the the people everything felt around that area possibly let's see the summary 19900 that's actually pretty good i think almost 20 000 is a great score but let's go for another another uh game so this dad is talking to the ladies okay it might be like a tourist group possibly with a bus right there this sign i'm getting spanish vibes but the road doesn't really feel spanish is that spanish or this sign reminds me of portugal but these signs are not portuguese are they i feel like we could see this there are two languages here i think right these are two different languages might be spanish and and some i don't know some of the other languages that are spoken in in spain some local ones a lot of countries have like minority languages and sometimes they have their own words on signs maybe maybe it's catalan maybe it's something else i don't know um but i think i will guess somewhere up here just in case but okay it was somewhere up here yeah it was somewhere up here even closer to the border i don't think it was french i don't think that other other language was french but let me know maybe it was maybe i just don't recognize it this dad is just standing here with a cane just i don't know if enjoying nature or or looking for some wood for construction work okay this is official coverage let's see no antennas absolutely nothing on the google car definitely feels asian like the nature again the people i'm not the best at people guessing sometimes it can be helpful these palm trees yeah i i'm not sure which asian country this would be i'm thinking maybe thailand thailand would probably be my main guess here but where it's quite risky thailand is quite stretched out it might as well be somewhere down all the way down here it since it's pretty hilly but it's hilly up here it's hilly down here shall we go for the let's go for the crazy guess let's go down here i wasn't even thailand it was philippines the philippines i wasn't very sure about the thailand there but that was my best guess but but uh good job to those who guess philippines there that's a good guess what do we have here so the dad is just just riding on a motorbike well cool is this malaysia is this malaysia yeah these look like malaysian license plates with two white sections in indonesia you get three white sections also i didn't see any front plates on the motorcycle in indonesia you should have a front plate on the motorbikes although they won't be always there some people drive without them but but you are supposed to have them do we have we do have a black sticker on the pole which would indicate that we are in the mainland malaysia which is useful maybe it's not super close to kuala lumpur maybe somewhere here that would be my guess okay it was more central a bit closer to kuala lumpur but not a bad guess i'm happy with that from the first glance my first thought is uh andorra let's look around if it actually is some license plates some small license plates without blue strips or anything it's the language english and vigilant parking huh but the the the vibe with mountains and houses like these just get very andorran vibes oh these are the dads i forgot to pay attention to the dad's dads are just chilling smoking i think then waving to the google car titan looks well it's not luxembourg lux is not gonna trick me i would go on andorra probably the capital city somewhere okay let's go let's see it was it was the capital city just the other side still only lost three points here pretty good oh what is this here is the dad nice oh is he taking the picture oh that's cool technology taking the picture himself with a huge dream catcher very big dream catcher here in what cultures do they have dream cutters look the the native native americans had some dream catchers now um i'm not sure but this definitely feels like north america the houses i'm not sure if it's america us the usa or canada well this definitely feels like north america looks like some sort of a camping camping grounds the author's name is polisslav dwarzak i don't think that helps us too much i would maybe go [Music] south dakota nebraska but don't really know but this is a cool cool cool dream catcher it was oh it was canada it was canada not the usa this island what's the island's name man amani tolling island close to the border but yeah interesting i don't think i've ever seen coverage on that island to be honest 17 000 points this time a little bit worse mainly because of the the philippines round and the last one the us round but let's see if we can do better in the third game and by the way leave a like if you enjoy these play along videos and let me know in the comments how did you do in any of these games we had this round before we had this round before and which city was it i remember it was more north than i thought it would be can we find so it was west of work i remember i even read the name what was the name my memory guys you know my memory isn't that good i remember now yes what's the road direction or direction is like that that that fits yeah what do we have here we have uh ocharov barney here i'm not sure what that means that looks like a pretty big road and this looks like a very small where's the biggest road this is like a really big road here is there a roundabout maybe there do we see doesn't seem so okay we were okay that was the road we were just further away we only lost one point here pretty good now wait where's the dad here oh that is repairing the car i see i see nice handyman handyman european union flag small license plates though beats up way meet subway you have a white car any electricity counters that they might might be helpful um i don't see any though oh there's a doggo in the distance that's cute that is cute which country could this doggo be from what are the poles do we see the poles bulls don't help me this be bolivia olivia or chile or peru [Music] let's go bolivia maybe it was bolivia yes nice it was oh it was sucre not a bad guess here is the dad nice taking a photo sphere in a beach you guys know i hate beach locations so great to have it this beach we can't even trust the compass here you can't trust anything just uh looks like a lovely beach in a way it reminds me of latvian beaches but i don't think it's latvia but it might be nearby lithuania poland maybe maybe estonia could be somewhere completely different as well you never know with beaches i i don't like beach locations i've said it thousand times i'll say a thousand times more let's go let's go somewhere here okay okay okay i didn't check the author's name would the author's name have helped adam booth well the author's name is very english maybe that could have been a clue that's unfortunate okay next round the dads are standing here talking about business possibly okay uh what is the that's the letter that you have in portuguese right so this yeah we have portuguese license plates is a bear a place it might be just the car place name but let's let's try to find a beta quickly maybe we get lucky no no noah bear unfortunately how does it look looks looks i would say maybe around here yeah maybe okay no it was more north and it was viseo was the city this looks like a spanish-speaking place what are the dads doing or playing some cards okay okay wait oh no we have some oh this is brazil and i thought we that was spanish at first but no we have this again this c letter with the tail and we have some um area codes here 21. oh where was 21 21 was um was sao paulo 21 i think it was two tens twenties somewhere here i think i don't remember if sao paulo is 21 or maybe rio i think i'll go san paolo should refresh again my my brazilian area codes i was rio that was my other option i could have been further away though to be fair four thousand points for brazil that's that's okay again 17 000 points and what screwed me over was that beach location i don't like beach locations i think you will enjoy this play along video on the right side where i play some of the most popular maps in geocacer huge thanks to all of the patrons and members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/bjVbIbGGVS658P1f", "data/images_geopeter/IQpfVIv7ILLEZo8G",

geographer play along video we'll be playing some of the most popular maps on geoguessr they will be diverse world urban world geo-detective and extraordinary world the links as always will be in the description make sure to play before watching this video let's have one and a half minutes per round and no moving let's go and don't forget to leave a like before we start if you enjoy these play along videos uh we have oh what are you what an interesting road line yellow and white together you don't see that very often that's for sure i'm thinking philippines maybe driving on the right side with these very interesting looking road lines plate could be philip from the philippines we have some english uh in the philippines you will often see english and spanish this looks like a boss you might see in philippines like those jeepneys you see those jeepneys uh a lot in philippines uh what's the road direction probably not gonna help us much but but maybe we're somewhere on this road who knows okay we're on a different road but it was the philippines and a pretty good guess actually 62 kilometers away i call it a good start sometimes you get easier locations sometimes you get more difficult in diverse world they're basically at many different kinds of locations from all around the world more than 50 000 hand-picked locations so that's there's a good reason why that's the most popular map in geo guesser ulitza we have this fall looking coverage and you get that in croatia in croatia you will also get ulitza with latin letters and license plates with a no blue strip on the left side when the coverage was taken there was no blue strip from what i have heard croatia now uses the blue strip on the new license plate but yeah in the coverage there still is no blue strip so i'm fairly sure that we are in croatia do we see the google car at all no not really just the antenna sometimes you can see the little little bits of car that might help not this time though so um let's go to croatia and let's go we do have some mountains so maybe somewhere here ish the more you get to the west i feel the the more mountainous you get because these parts are very very mountainous near near there okay very good guess 33 kilometers pretty good pretty good even closer than the first round now we have some holy poles you get holy poles in a couple of countries but this reminds me of belgium this license plate i don't know if you can tell but it looks a little bit uh reddish like a red tint and you do get that uh in belgium because belgium uses red characters on their license plates we have french language so that would fit with belgium i'm not 100 sure but i think i have seen bus stops like these in belgium as well since we have french and only french here we might be closer to the french border let's guess la luviere i hope my pronunciation is okay let's get somewhere there okay very super close to the border actually super close 37 kilometers away but again pretty good guess really good guess belgium is a small country so so wherever i would have guessed would have been pretty close um oh what is this state um well this should be canada first of all because we have two languages what is this outline which which which province i thought we have an outline it should be easy but not none of the outlines match like what the hell is it like simplified new brunswick because new brunswick looks a little bit different monk monkton oh monkton i see monkton okay so this should be brunswick i wasted so much time looking for for which province this is uh roll 11. i don't see road 11 anywhere monkton is to our south we are much closer to moncton where's road 11 oh that is oh my god it's green okay i wasn't looking for green yeah yeah now i see it now i see it yeah did i still i still guessed kind of close to road 11 so oh i guess in miramira uh miramichi i didn't even see it accidentally guessed in that uh but i would have guessed around there even if i found miramichi i would have guessed somewhere around this area so no no big loss there okay this should be finland right you get a white solid line and double yellow lines in the middle in finland it's it's might be hard to tell but this line is yellow in the middle and this is a finished sign with a small yellow border around this one usually i try to determine how far north it is in nordic countries by how large the trees are these trees seem to be pretty big pretty big trees and i will go uh where shall we go no maybe a little bit even more south and it was more north okay ah unfortunate unfortunate but still 4 000 points almost all in all i'm pretty happy with my game 23 and a half thousand points close to yeah the last one last round was by far my worst if i had guessed closer i would have got could have gotten 24 000 which would have been even more impressive okay let's move on to the next map in urban world there are more than 2600 locations in more than 600 cities all around the world so that's a lot that's why people play this map pretty often because it you don't get repeats very often uh but let's see so we have generation four camera yellow license i'm pretty sure it should be the netherlands because also in the netherlands you often see this type of street from little bricks little red brick street or some brazilian shop i wonder if anyone will uh playing along will guess brazil but yeah that does not look like brazil brazil looks quite different usually i think i will just guess amsterdam because this seems to be like a pretty big city but uh yeah not sure which one unfortunately so let's go ah it was hog makes sense makes sense another pretty big city one of the biggest cities in the netherlands chose the wrong big city what can you do let's see so this is a greek sign in greece you will often see blue signs with yellow and white texts the sun is very greek what does it say diagoras airport the agoras airport okay let's let's try to find the agora somewhere if it has an airport it's either pretty big or it is on an island probably on a smaller island oh i was looking here i literally was just looking here i didn't see any diagora so so i moved on yeah it is called rhodes diagoras international airport i'm not sure why it is called tiagoras maybe some of my creek viewers can let me know we have a romanian flag with some holy poles again so those are pretty good clues that we are in romania expert network oh this is an interesting is there a french plate looks like a french plate i guess some some french man or woman is coming to visit romania i'm getting small town vibes small city doesn't feel too mountainous although there could be some hills behind the the the buildings it's going to maybe near cebus or allude allude let's go there i was very eastern oh near moldova not doing as as good as in the diverse world i always like to read in the comments how you guys do so leave it in the comments your scores and then as you know i always read all of the comments so yeah uh this is the typical kyrgyzstan uh license plate with a red on the left side also this car is a typical kyrgyz car so this is kyrgyzstan for sure also we see some cyrillic here which just confirms it because in kyrgyzstan they use cyrillic alphabet we see some mountains we see some mountains to the north and north east i'm not sure how how helpful it is because kyrgyzstan is full of mountains i don't think it is bishkek i think it might be somewhere here maybe near this this big lake because i've seen quite a lot of uh locations around there direction of the road is what north or maybe somewhere there maybe somewhere here actually that fits a little bit better but that's just just a stretch we could be as well on this side or nosh or something okay we weren't that close to the black we were in this looks like a spanish sign with no white borders around around the edges that's that that would make me think uh spain also we see kale on that side color means street in spanish blue strips on the cars italian restaurant again i wonder if anyone will guess italy because of this that would be pretty funny sometimes you get these these baby locations and then the clues if you don't don't notice color and the spanish signs could might as well be italy right where could this be madrid i'm getting more coastal vibes i might be wrong i'm getting coastal vibes here um so i'm not gonna guess madrid we we don't have catalan language in catalan it is something it may be malaga murcia maybe seville let's just let's guess murcia i hope it's not just madrid again again just the capital oh my god it was just madrid okay how did i do i mean not too bad but but definitely worse than in the first game 20 500 points the third map we're gonna play is geodetective which is intended for no moving games which is perfect for our play style so let's start again link of course in the description what do we have passenger pickup english driving it looks like we're driving on the left side so i'm thinking malta oh kangaroo island oh never mind kangaroo island is here hello hello we have water to our north east with a big ferry here i might be very wrong but it should be still be this island i might be on the wrong side or something oh it was there oh i guess yeah makes sense now that i see it 15 kilometers off so not that bad not that bad good start i would say pretty good start generally in the this should be hong kong with this science english and chinese oh it even says hong kong here i yeah people people often comment that i notice all of these small clues and miss some very obvious signs that either or flags that give the country away these are some really cool skyscrapers damn i have not seen these before they look really really cool indonesian bank again a baby one some people might fall for it but yeah these signs and also yellow backplates that's hong kong hong kong uses yellow backplates i'm assuming because of the british rule they were under british control for for a while feels like some very big business district with some huge huge huge houses i don't know where there is a business district in hong kong but i'm assuming it pro it's probably somewhere quite central so i would guess i mean says central here but i would i would go the business district is somewhere here ish maybe direction of the road is maybe here then if we if we follow the direction of the road maybe that street oh no it was oh my god it was near central okay should have gone with the central yeah the road road matches here these are the big buildings around still within five kilometers that's a pretty good score next we have budapest but it's an in a different country h indicates that we are not in in hungary hungary is elsewhere casino banker casino bratislava could we be near bratislava or this might not be in bratislava this might be the actually might be the border checkpoint what's the direction of the road like that so it's not that checkpoint not that check if this even is border checkpoint i don't know might not be a border checkpoint might be like a tall road maybe so i think i'll guess near brought this lava what was the other city budapest somebody combat hilly there oh here there is a border checkpoint here how did i miss that that the direction matches perfectly as well okay i'll guess here then nice okay not 5k i guess too close to the to the border itself okay i totally missed this border checkpoint finding zombat kelly helped because because i was thinking it might be closer to this city because it's smaller okay perfect perfect well almost perfect almost 5k hello horizonte oh god i've heard of bello horizonte where was it 34 34 you get oh here is bello horizonte pretty big city that's anyway i've heard of it below horizonte is south uh pira por montes claros montes claros is here pirapora is here pirapora is kinda to our it's a roundabout so it's hard to tell which direction exactly maybe kind of to our north ish i think i will leave it around there because pirapora seems to be relatively small so i'm thinking we might be somewhere close-ish to pirapora for brazil's size 110 kilometers is good we were on a different road more here next round next round and what is this now who is this huggie a sofia the famous famous landmark in istanbul istanbul so this is istanbul oh where is or it was this nut hug i don't know it might be a different different mosque or or landmark where is the water we're next to water aren't we yes so water is to our east and we're we're on a bridge basically we're on a bridge like here there's another bridge there yes yes so i think we are here yeah the like the road also splits into two so that seems to work here so i think this should be a 5k oh new badge i i didn't realize i hadn't played this map in a while uh zero meters oh perfect could can't get any better than that perfect score the summary 24 548 my highest score today which makes sense that it would be in geo detective because the map is designed to be played not moving and the last map of the video will be by far the most difficult one it's called an extraordinary world which contains some beautiful locations all around the world and the average score is only eight thousand two hundred and eighty nine it's pretty low my goal is to beat the average score because i usually do terrible terribly in this game this map some tourists some bike riders my regular viewers will know that i'm not very good with locations like these that's why i usually don't play this this map but for this video for the purposes of this video i thought that might be pretty good we have a pretty large city with some towers in the distance lots of skyscrapers wouldn't be europe well it doesn't really look like europe but also in europe you don't get skyscrapers like these so densely built i don't think we have we are right next to water on a small island it seems could this be north america or or central america south america i'm thinking maybe one of the americas it would be too flat for colombia and ecuador i think mexico maybe mexico somewhere mexi coastal mexico let's go maybe somewhere i don't i don't know let's see if it is even mexico it was not oh my god what what right right i had no idea this island existed that's a tough one well now you know why this map has such a low average score because some of these locations are just insane nepalese and italian so could this be nepal it definitely looks feels like it might be nepal must wait mustang is a place ah all the way there at least i went with nepal i know there is like the mount everest base camp somewhere around here that's why i went there i thought maybe that's somewhere nearby okay next round we are under a pretty big bridge belgrade so serbian license plate a belgrade number plate doesn't mean that we're necessarily in belgrade but that's a great clue we are north side on of the river this is official coverage so serbia belgrade north side of a river there are not many bridges so since this is official coverage we can trust the compass oh the bridge turns to the left after okay these bridges don't really match up could it be this one that's my best best bet just now these are not the bridges that we are wait this oh my god i noticed this bridge too late oh i was focusing on the yellow i totally missed this one oh no that's terrible i should have done better yeah i did i didn't even realize that this is a bridge the small one that's probably like a railway bridge muhammad bell is the author here so since the author's name is muhammad i'm thinking maybe somewhere middle east somewhere around there because i know that's the very most popular name in the world right muhammad it's important here to pay attention to author's name because sometimes it can have some very important clues could this be afghanistan maybe i could see this being afghanistan i think i think i'll guess afghanistan somewhere around here this area maybe oh wow i was way off oh wow oh wow libya in the middle of nowhere literally wow that's insane i would have never guessed there okay and next on i'm already above average so that's good i'm already happy with my score on this map my goal was to get above average so mission accomplished we are next to some very very high mountains these kind of bell-looking shapes remind me of asia definitely asia could this be what do you see the license plate white but we're drawing the left side i was thinking could this be dawn but bhutan would have red license plates now let's guess let's get cindy uh somewhere here i switched closer to nepal not sure maybe i should have stayed around there oh no it was oh it was disputed territory of of uh ludwig ladakh well i didn't get a great score but i'm happy i did better than the average if you enjoyed this video don't forget to leave a like and

hand-picked locations of abandoned places camera glitches hidden holes not sure what that is but let's play and see uh hopefully those will be some interesting locations so minute and a half no moving links in the description make sure to play them before watching this video oh okay what is this this is like a part of some some opener museum maybe some some exhibition here uh i'm not sure what's happening uh a bunch of like some rock formations interesting interesting i have no idea we have like a pyramids of sorts not really a pyramid more like a pile interesting indeed i don't know what to think of this there's just a chair here to sit down i'm guessing this is like some open-air museum but where i'm thinking maybe somewhere in africa getting a little bit of maybe egypt vibes but not entirely i'm thinking maybe sudan kind of like a deserty deserty looking place with rocks i know sudan has lots of pyramids this isn't necessarily a pyramid but something similar so maybe maybe the sudan has the most pyramids in the world more than egypt fun fact fun fact so let's guess sudan see if it is ah it was actually just egypt oh no i tried to outsmart myself it was just egypt but at least i mean i considered egypt so that's nice ah sometimes yeah happens when you try to out think yourself should have just gone with with egypt because it was the i guess obvious choice this is a beautiful castle very beautiful castle probably a famous one but you guys know i don't know famous places just the super super obvious ones but definitely europe 100 europe the houses the castle itself everything feels very european but further than that which country could this be trying to look at the architecture maybe maybe get get some sense where we could be getting maybe slovenian vibes in a little bit maybe slovenia maybe the architecture feels in a way slovenian but uh i'm really not confident here could this be austria maybe this could be just austria or maybe even czechia or slovakia thinking one of these four countries we'll see if i'm right i think i'll get slovenia because that was my first thought okay it was austria close very close actually 95 kilometers away that's pretty pretty good in my opinion pretty good in my opinion kind of get those architect what the hell is this now um now this is creepy they did say that there are creepy locations here now i would definitely would consider this creepy what the hell someone has gone overboard with the scarecrows no crows appear here in the 100 mile radius this is so creepy and this one even has a face on it what on the shirt what the hell is this now oh we have a flag that's a finnish flag i guess we're in finland any finns in the chat maybe you can explain what the hell is this place i don't know let's get in the middle of finland like there are not really any other clues you either know where this is in finland or you don't no signs in sight let's let's splunk it maybe a little bit closer to capital somewhere here maybe oh no it was very northern oh okay where was that place the quiet people okay the name is even more creepy the quiet people the silent people what the hell that's the quiet people okay that's creepy af oh this is interesting like some some eternal fire i guess i know there's this eternal fire pit in uh turkmenistan was it that they are trying to [Music] stop but i guess this is another like eternal fire maybe or maybe they're just burning stuff maybe they're just burning stuff here but it looks like the rock has been burning for a while here now where could this be where could this be like the architecture feels i was thinking of georgia could this be georgia or around there azerbaijan armenia this this house the people kind of feels like could be that area no no no no language visible no real real landscape much i think i would go somewhere yeah in georgia rustavi maybe somewhere around there when i was i visited georgia i definitely didn't visit this place i would have remembered that but let's get somewhere here i was azerbaijan well it was one of the three countries i considered yeah there was azerbaijan near baku near the capital okay decent score i'm pretty happy with the score kind of the first thought was that look kind of like egypt vibes but but the landscape doesn't really fit egypt which confuses me a little bit okay this is so weird where could this be the landscape feels very northern either super super north or super super south i'd probably would say super north but where with build like structures like these this is weird uh probably say europe because i don't think north america would have structures like these these look quite quite old and and remain kind of like medieval castles in a way but where i don't know i have no idea where to guess here super flat could this be like this isn't greenland what no i don't know where to guess russia could this be like northern russia somewhere let's see it's northern russia i don't know i'm really confused by this location let's see where the hell was this okay it wasn't nearly as northern as i thought it was it was kazakhstan yeah but by the landscape it felt super northern to me i guess i was wrong it was novi sauron sauron ancient settlement okay it did look very ancient that's for four that was a very interesting one super interesting location in kazakhstan let's see the summary almost 16 000 points pretty good pretty good uh let's go again let's go again uh if you are enjoying this video leave a like it really really helps the channel and leave a comment i read all of the comments always so what is weird or interesting or creepy here trust your water um i don't see anything particularly creepy or interesting here so maybe the coverage got overwritten by a new one this does look like it might be a new coverage so maybe the creepy or interesting thing is no more so okay so this is somewhere in america you guys know i'm not very good in america but let's see if we can find any clues with at least these trucks most of them have front plates this one doesn't trust your water advanced i don't know the area codes the area codes are all over the place so i don't really see the point of studying them too much the us area codes could be could this be canada even by any chance with these road lines maybe this is canada i'm thinking maybe oh god only 15 seconds let's guess maybe near toronto somewhere up here and if it isn't if it is u.s then i think it would be somewhere up here as well so i think near toronto might be a good guess maybe okay it was just the u.s north carolina more south than i expected 3 000 points okay what is that huh oh what is that some sort of a tree trunk carved tree trunk with some uh stripes zigzags stop stop is this sweden these short dashes would make me think sweden well the houses in general definitely felt nordic with these white corners these short dashes wouldn't make me think sweden in particular oh there's a flag that we can't really see but you see these these like triangular flags all over nordic countries and estonia as well sometimes hmm this is such a certain way could this be estonia actually because in estonia you also can't get short dashes although these are not the usual estonian houses but you can sometimes see these type of houses in estonia as well 2 000 oh is this okay let's get southern sweden near near way eastern sweden just in case it is estonia actually okay no it was just sweden very northern sweden so only 3 000 points here it's in such a huge country as well well maybe because i'm in latvia all the countries seem huge to me next round round number three what is that oh a sort of uh like a like a lifted boat or something almost looks like noah's arch what is that what else do we have have a church what is that um okay so many countries use these these called this color combination could be russia could be slovenia could be others i don't know i don't know that that middle crest which country would that be let's look at the architecture well definitely doesn't feel like russia i can tell that much uh feels like maybe serbia i think this this my main guess would be serbia looking at the houses the architecture the nature feels more serbian than slovakian or slovenian i don't think any other countries would have these colors right they have flags like these in russia slovakia slovenia and serbia i think if i'm i hope i'm not forgetting anything i would guess serbia a pretty mountainous well hilly probably would be a more accurate term the more uh the more south you go in serbia the more hilly it gets so let's maybe around here not bad oh it was kosovo okay it was kosovo it was it was the place okay it was something it was something and what is this now very deserty location what is the plate i can't really see it looks like there's like some red or black at the top ah very interesting rock formations i don't know if i would guess africa or middle east it's it's either one of the two i'm pretty sure it's either northern africa or middle east i'm currently between like morocco or algeria or like saudi arabia possibly iraq mean around those areas i am thinking i'm leaning more towards algeria and morocco somewhere here maybe maybe this is near sahara desert but i guess we'll see oh the other one the other one oh it was uae interesting interesting yeah fossil dunes hmm yeah uae didn't cross moment i was thinking saudi arabia i mean uae makes sense as well it's right there i can chose the wrong side chose the wrong side should have gone with in saudi arabia would have been a much much better score there oh what is that is this from glass or are those balloons no those are not balloons is that made from glass some glass sculpture that's it that is interesting this is so cool like snakes of some sort from i'm assuming it's gloss let's look around what else do we have here oh some some paintings murals i think is the word paintings on walls i think we're called murals a happy hour of shopping you have some english happy hour of shopping okay security guard oh 40 seconds remaining where could this be i'm thinking india maybe oh we have some uh arabic i assume royal much less i'm oh yeah we have some some head head scarfs oh um i don't know with arabic and looking like this super fancy rich maybe like qatar one of these countries these are super rich countries with oil and stuff well not all of them but but many of these countries are very very rich so maybe like qatar bahrain uae maybe again oh it was uae again okay it was one of these countries interesting interesting yeah i was considering india at moment for a second there yeah uae makes perfect sense let's view the summary fifteen thousand points so worse than the first game but i think i did okay that that the the desert round number four screw me over the most in this play along video we play some weird and out of place locations so check that out huge thanks to all of the patrons and members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see

description says it's part tricky part misleading so let's see what kind of tricky and misleading locations it has you guys can play along as well the links will be in the description just make sure to play it before watching this video so let's set the timer to minute and a half i think that should be fine no moving good luck everyone let's see what we have we have a chase bank with a chinese language i believe oh but we are driving in the right side with plates like these this feels like a lot of these yellow plates feels like this is new york yeah nyc buildings so this is new york some sort of like uh like a chinese district i i guess so yeah kind of kind of a tricky tricky location i i can see that but i do believe that this should be new york believe yeah like some some apple tv advertisements as well fedex definitely definitely new york can we can we funny like street names moth street canal street i don't know where in new york there is chinatown i don't know where there are mott and canal streets is this the canal no that's a river river maybe canal street isn't like near some canal but but that's just a guess i don't know let's guess somewhere here-ish not too bad not too bad actually five kilometers away without knowing anything about other than being in new york oh it says oh my god it literally says chinatown on map i didn't know i didn't know that it says chinatown on the map okay that would have helped a lot okay but still good score good score either way the author's name is mojtaba ali nejad okay um i don't know what what could be author's nationality based on that name not sure ali nejad i think i'm thinking like maybe something like tajikistan i don't know maybe that's that's the chic name wait that looks kind of like a chinese symbol for two this be china people don't really look that chinese this might be a muslim country muslim majority country hmm i don't know i'll keep it in okay i keep it kept kept it in tajikistan it was iran you know it almost made me switch to china but okay it was iran it was angi park okay not the best yes but i'm average i'm happy with that definitely could have been way worse the author is fernando cartoso garcias okay aluga okay is this spanish or is this portuguese that's the question because this word feels portuguese to me this e-sign you can find it all over latin america so that doesn't help too much speaking spanish or portuguese would help a lot here i think i'm torn i'm torn i don't even know if this is spanish or portuguese for sure because of this word with our ending feels more portuguese i might be wrong brasilia maybe let's go brasilia it's kind of for hedging purposes sort of in the middle in brazil okay it was san paolo so it was portuguese i was right on that i don't know how i could have known it was san paolo if i could have known it was sao paulo other than guessing but i'm happy that i got the right country here i think that's a that's a good achievement already oh no a beach location you guys know how much i love these beach locations oh the author is richard mendelssohn where is richard from huh this could be anywhere literally could be anywhere in the world my main guess would be like somewhere in the caribbean maybe but no actual idea let's guess dominica or maybe guadalupe let's get is there you guadalupe see it's like some islands around maybe it's like guadalupe somewhere here maybe okay no oh zero points lovely okay so it was japan that was a difficult one i don't know how if you got that round let me know in the in the comments how cuz i'm very bad at beach locations okay the author is michael wetchhoff michael get gwechov this architecture feels asian to me i was thinking like myanmar maybe that was my first thought but let's examine very beautiful very beautiful building wherever this is oh wait a handicap access oh so we have english this might be a touristy location so seeing english doesn't necessarily mean that this is an english-speaking country but uh hmm this was myanmar i would have expected seeing other languages as well not only english oh okay i'm confused now maybe this isn't myanmar maybe this is again one of the uh like caribbean islands or something very beautiful building though wherever this is i mean this isn't out of place maybe it's out of place because it's only english or maybe the architecture is out of place and this is somewhere completely different i'll i'll still guess myanmark as that was my first thought but this i have a feeling this might be like an island somewhere somewhere in the middle of the ocean okay i wasn't thinking los angeles what the hell malibu hindu temple wow okay no no shot i ever guess los angeles here 10 000 points some rounds with some rounds i'm very happy with like the first one the third one the second one the last two rounds oh my god so off so off uh i wonder how how you guys will do if you play along these challenges but let's go for the next round if you enjoy these play along videos leave a like leave a comment i read all of the comments and the likes really help out the channel leisure leisure leisure cafe okay we have no front plates on the motorcycle good to know the author's name is vr and then some symbols this feels very asian to me very asian i wouldn't necessarily say china of course could be but but i'm thinking could this be like vietnam because i know in vietnam they like to drive around on motorcycles a lot that's very very popular there are some high buildings nearby so this could be a very big city like hanoi or something also an english cafe leisure cafe is likely to to be in a large city so hanoi maybe that would be my main guess ah so okay it was chinese the author's name i guess so okay it was what is the city shanghai outskirts of shanghai um maybe i should have guessed china in the hindsight because of the author's name but again this is supposed to be out of place locations tricky locations you never know when they are trying to double bluff you okay some interesting coverage some glitchy coverage where is the sun the sun is the north sun is to the north supposedly what are the poles are they brazilian poles or not i can't really tell we what i noticed is that we have this small antenna which is possible in brazil but other than that i wish you could see the poles a little bit closer that would help but the the soil is quite red you do get red soil in brazil the sun appears to be to our north which also would match with brazil in brazil often times sun will be to the north the the houses could be south american this house so i think brazil is a good guess here let's see let's see where it is let's guess somewhere here it was brazil more more southern brazil um admittedly i should practice brazilian regions more to better tell apart how different regions look like that's something i haven't practiced much oh this is a repeat oh god where was it this was oh my memory this was so i guessed in brasilia and it was san paolo somewhere in sao paulo let's not waste too much time okay nice 49.69 nice so that was a quick one since we had it before okie what is this now this motorcycle we have no front plates or is that is that a front plate is that a front plate or but i can't tell oh my god this is tricky like this house feels european very european these houses feel asian to me these these high high buildings and i'm getting some south american vibes as well so i'm very confused i'm thinking indonesia maybe based on this what's the author's name barry casey lee getting very mixed feelings here i don't think this would be europe i don't think this would be europe looking like this so asia or asia or latin america [Music] um malaysia maybe or jakarta maybe jakarta for not i wanted to switch to malaysia oh my god it was macau i guess that makes sense with like european influence so european style houses there okay again asian style house this is a tricky tricky world out of place out of place so doesn't mean that this would be necessarily asia might be an asian influenced house somewhere else this is unofficial coverage so we cannot trust compass sun wood sun points to the north we can't trust it unfortunately the license plate uh i can not tell can not tell it looks kind of wide i can't tell if it's european or indonesian or something else the bags don't have anything helpful this look like a like an orchard is that the word i don't know where to guess honestly i'm thinking maybe new zealand it's such a risky guess to go new zealand because there's nothing really around if it is new zealand you get a lot of points if it isn't you get zero basically uh let's all switch to europe did i switch it in time oh god did i switch in time i don't know i'll be either in new zealand or europe okay even better this was san paolo i guess new zealand would have been a little bit closer but again like it still would be like around two points probably i was not considering brazil to be honest i was thinking maybe europe maybe new zealand maybe it's actually asia well none of the options this is a terrible terrible game 8 000 points even less than the first game so not my proudest proudest game but admittedly there were some very tricky ones for me at least let me know if you did better than me i'm interested to to hear your thought process maybe i missed something it's in one of these locations okay let's let's play one more let's play one more what is this now that looks like an italian flag i don't know what is the other one could this be italy could this be somewhere in italy we see a lot of uh asian ethnicity people a lot of asians around so i don't think this will be italy what is this maybe it's just an italian shoe store or something why is there italian flag twice i'm so confused what is this is this china or is this italy it looks like like this does might have some chinese let's guess like near beijing i don't know it it looks like this might be chinese and in italy they would would have italian that's the only reason because okay it was china it wasn't even that far from beijing it was closer to tanjin tanjin what was that place okay i can't read what it is because it's in in mandarin but some shopping italian shopping mall or something so weird i'm very happy with the score though but that was a confusing one very confusing man okay we have an american flag and a fake statue of liberty [Laughter] okay um where do they have a fake statue of liberty what the hell because this is not the real one i know that much but what is this we have yellow yellow line in the middle we have huge trucks that you don't really see in europe that much so this i think this is north america this house does feel kind of european but maybe it's just like european influence in north america what why would they have a fake statue of liberty though why and where yellow lines this feels like north america and this probably is usa just where and why my two biggest questions of the video where and why i'm guessing maybe like north east but why would they have another statue of liberty that close maybe it's like on the opposite side of the country so they don't have to travel all all across but it was alabama birmingham liberty park okay um okay next round let's see what what what other rounds do we have here okay this is official coverage that's good next water red plate is this brazil i know in brazil you can have red plates and this also looks like the new brazilian plate with like those unified plates they have in multiple countries with blue at the top and then white so the plates look brazilian we have black side and backs which you also see in brazil uh what else language spanish or portuguese well i'm assuming it's portuguese because other clues look like this should be brazil 81 is it 81 or 87. the day on stream i refreshed my my brazilian phone codes so ones twos threes or fives this is where here sevens eights are up here 87 might be some son louis or maybe or maybe belem but we have water here to our east maybe san luis or something there is some water i mean there admittedly there is water in all of these like northern cities porto armasance ah it was all the way there i guess i guess this might have been 90s already this might have been 90s but still could be worse definitely better if i had plonked it here where i usually plonk i mean brazil is a huge country so 1200 kilometers away that hurts for the score but but i am happy that i got the country okay fourth round here uh the characters might be might be mandarin but let's keep in mind oh vr guy we already had this vr author no the vr author i guessed in vietnam but it wasn't china well at least a lot last time we had this guy as an author because i remember this guy as author vr and then two like chinese symbols i guessed in hanoi and it turned out to be somewhere where was it i don't remember i don't remember if it was beijing or something else wait was it shank high was that the round it might have been shanghai well i don't know maybe that guy is traveling across multiple chinese cities that's also possible but but i could see like with all of this chinese we see around i can see this being shanghai this doesn't look like your typical shanghai but that's what this map is all about right some some interesting and weird weird locations so i think let's go shanghai nice that's that's why it's important it is important to pay attention to authors names because with the location itself i would not have guessed shanghai but since i remembered author from that previous previous round he had the other game pretty good guess pretty good guess okay what a cute doggo a family legacy getting a lot of asian asian locations here we have an american flag which is interesting 30 anniversary huh i'm thinking is this like china or is this taiwan would they have a big big american flag in china i i can't see in china there being huge american flag without even bigger chinese flag nearby i i don't see it happening so i think this might be taiwan just just because of that american flag uh where no idea no idea where let's go taipei maybe let's see if this was even taiwan maybe it was china maybe it was maybe i was wrong let's see oh my okay it was los angeles again what the hell i i didn't think that was an actual possibility the light temple wow okay interesting yeah it felt like we are definitely in asia so wow wow just just wow almost 13 000 points my highest score in this video so i'm happy with that to do two great guesses in china and and and others not so not so great let me know in the comments how did you do in these challenges and on the right side there will be another play along video in geo detective world so you can try that one out as well huge thanks to all the patrons and members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful

geoguesser which is a map supposedly containing easier locations which are easier to find on the map so hopefully we get some good scores you can play along as well the links are in the description you can play with the free version too so even if you don't have pro you can play along make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything uh let's have one and a half minutes and no moving those will be our restrictions so so to make it a little bit more challenging what is it paraguay good start good start uh okay let's see if we have city maybe maybe city name somewhere from the first glance i was thinking like these are kind of paraguay colors the pole looks brazilian so it could be somewhere in that area paraguay chopin del este is the city del este [Music] it should have a city name somewhere right del este i don't see del este might be a smaller city shouldn't be a tool too small of a city though if 30 seconds remaining adj the license plates cch hbo i don't think they help 11 is that is that a city maybe 11 no i don't see it um we pogo no idea which is the city or which isn't i guess we'll just keep it in the capital because i i don't know it was oh my god it was all the way eastern paraguay what's the name of the city ciudad del este i guess i mean i knew the country but it was difficult oh wow what is this one this is an interesting one wow watch for divers georgia aquarium well i'm guessing it's the um you know united states the state of georgia not the country of georgia right with the military salute and then the home depot should be the state of georgia the georgia aquarium now would it be in atlanta or would it be in a different different city i have no idea i have never even been to the us of a so no hello really but i'm looking george aquarium here we go okay that's good um i don't think there is a way for us to really pinpoint this location within the aquarium maybe if you have been there maybe you can kind of kind of navigate through there's no no guarantee that this location is very accurate could be somewhere just just but i think we should be fine georgia aquarium let's guess 66 meters it's still a 5k still a 5k let's go i'm very happy at least at least i get one one 5k but i'll take it oh i thought this had gone out first by hawaiian are we in in hawaii [Music] definitely sounds kind of hawaiian is that a city maybe [Music] glancing over quickly if we see listen i don't see any mokuleles here so um again mokulele airlines hawaii based wiki wiki uh okay i mean it should be mokulela now let's let's have another look maybe mokulele here somewhere mokulela mokulela yeah let's keep it in honolulu molokai airport did it say molokai as well did it say molokai i was looking for mokulele maybe it maybe it's the same maybe it means the same thing maybe mokulela is the same as molokai in in their language but okay could have been better still for a 700 really good yellowstone national park okay i i'm not good at national parks but yellowstone i know where is i've seen a couple of videos on youtube which talk about how how when yellowstone erupts it will be bad national park service so it looks like we are entering yellowstone from the north it seems i'm guessing this is like the sun at the entrance of the park i'm assuming um gifts like we have gift stores and like parking the parking lot there um west yellowstone maybe here really don't no any any other clues not really not really trading post gifts yellowstone association 14 seconds remaining maybe it is there maybe it is there's like an entrance into the park so it's in west yellowstone maybe ah it was up here a different city next i mean it was like an entrance to yellowstone just a different entrance was the north entrance not the west entrance oh well okay and uh the fifth round of this game okey dokey let's see the first thought was like central america maybe but uh let's see ubanos does that man keep me in cuban so okay it should be cuba big brain big brain center of attention massage is that like a city something i'm trying to figure out where's the city san juan san juansense lisa mara okay let's have a look at um at the cuba cuban map santiago de cuba you don't have too much time uh i don't think this is havana i don't notice any of the places that i red anywhere on the map so what i guess i'll keep it kind of in the middle to hedge hopefully get hopefully get a good score maybe okay um i got debated what the hell it was nicaragua what apparently we were in messiah in nicaragua uh did it say messiah somewhere was one of the words messiah it did say messiah well if i if i knew that messiah was a city in nicaragua would have been pretty good but it literally said it literally said cuba i guess like this is like a memorial for cubans or something i don't know but this this this really baited me very hard i i fully trusted this uh memorial or what whatever that is and i guess i won't be the only one let me know in the comments if it debated you as well and and leave a like while you are at it uh 21 000 points i mean all in all not not a terrible score the last round just uh messed me up messed me up um oh no is this oh this is a broken coverage okay i'll make a new game then if it's the first round let's just make a new game um yeah if it shows the same round as the previous time oftentimes it's just a broken coverage that uh geographer cannot load so this is the actual one um you said so uzbekistan i think the flag also matches i think that is the flag of uzbekistan now uzbekistan is uh the capital is on a one side so if you want to guess capital it's quite risky in a way so it could be somewhere else let's see if we can find some other city names malacca what any of that means i have no idea which ones of these are might be even like city names i am something is that a city name well at least at least we know the country i guess but i really was hoping for something more oh it was warship i somewhere okay okay there was the university that i didn't notice didn't pay attention to if if only i had noticed it that that would have been nice the author is sean do not enter children's animal farm seaway kiwanis oh i don't know what that means i don't know what that means okay we have a canadian flag oh you don't recognize the other one not sure not sure children's animal farm carriage house and these signs should have all the info that we need supposedly kiwani is kawani the city i've never heard of kiwani in in canada and this is like a seaside it says or seaway this is tougher than i thought it would be you want i've never heard of that iwani it's very unlikely for me to find it just like this canada is a big country but i gotta try pigeon hill lovely name oh all the way here sarnia sarnia did it says point edward tharnia or point edward anywhere didn't see yeah i don't see it anywhere hmm i wonder how could you have maybe this flag helped if you recognize that i don't know maybe but anyways let's move on andrey osmak is the author on this one it looks quite modern the modern statues uh is this portuguese we have english international so we're in an airport basically gold banned taxis which is the steering wheel steering wheel is on the opposite side so we're driving on the left side hmm that's very interesting with with this language driving the left side that nz oh and new zealand makes sense what is this why is there uh an accent under c bread and circus oh that one confused me i guess there is nz here as well which city oh god i don't know i'm guessing wellington maybe i mean surely has a as an airport in wellington right surely it's has the city name somewhere didn't see i think just as the round ended i think i saw christ church just as the round ended let's see if i'm right if it actually said christ church there christ church christ church airport oh my god if i had like literally i don't know three more seconds i would have guessed christ church oh that's unfortunate that hurts that hurts oh this is a fish an official coverage interesting all the previous ones have been unofficial so uh fatima gallego um the language looks portuguese yeah the license plates are also portuguese [Music] if only i could speak portuguese well i could speak portuguese uh uh i don't know which one of these names is the city name al buffeira maybe albufeira although it's okay it says albufeira in a bunch of places albufeira here we go here we go albufeira i mean it says that there's i think that said like we have like a so some sort of a like a point or something soon hotel sol emma hotel solema there's a big city to our north hotel solema hotel hotel bunch of hotels here hotel solema oh hotel ah no more time okay we have ten more seconds hotels lamar a little bit to like here we are i think this should be 5k guys i think it should be 5k yes three meters let's go let's go let's go okay welcome to margherita peak highest point in uganda oh it literally it literally says which country we are in uruguay and wildlife association wow this is i mean very foggy but i imagine it looks amazing when it isn't foggy or cloudy maybe these are clouds anyways margherita margherita margherita i don't know where in uganda they have this high margherita mountain now let's see uh maybe it says margherita somewhere oh yeah there is like some mountain there are some mountains here quite risky though because it's very very western there are some mountains here but i don't think these mountains are as high margherita peak like it seems that these mountains should be the highest from what i'm seeing on the map gotcha volcano there could be some very high peaks there as well margherita mount baker i haven't seen margarita anywhere and let's risk it and guess it this this part maybe it's somewhere in this these these mountains it was oh oh it's like literally on the on the other side of the border even in drc mount stanley i don't know it doesn't say margarita peak anywhere at all but i am glad i took the risk and then guessed there in that mountain range let's see the summary again 21 000. that canadian round cost me a lot the great canadian grant cost me a lot of points so challenge is no moving one and a half minutes let's go okay somewhere very snowy author is lydia atlasova okay we have cyrillic vladimir putin a quote quote by by putin rasi so so a quote about uh russia does it say the city anywhere a lot a lot of texts about russia but i don't see anything regarding which city we are in i mean it snows basically does it say yakutsk yakut something yakuza plaza maybe is on the map this seems like a pretty big a place big field like central maybe somewhere here ulitzaleniana centralini somewhere here i think very central um with lenny and lenin with this let's go 14 meters okay okay that was a good one learning cyrillic pays off like being able to read cyrillic pays off sometimes blue line is the author of this very interesting like statue i like it nice looking but where we are i've sounds hurt okay this is japan naga okay oka i'm guessing that's a city or maybe an island named nagaoka now okay i don't see anything else so we might as well start looking for naga oka maybe let's start with these islands don't have too much time so so gotta be fast some reason i was thinking could be maybe somewhere like southern part but that's just a random guess basically okay i was i was completely oh naga nagaoka was there okay okay let's continue teemu marti name is very nordic is this a border this is a border is this a border between which countries norgay okay between norway and finland good to know thank you very much norway and norwich norwegian and finnish border is up here um we are on a bridge yes yes so a bridge across a pretty big river it seems this bridge what's the direction supposedly we should be able to trust the compass okay that's no it isn't right or it is is it i don't think so but maybe i mean the direction is kinda similar but but maybe we can find a better no that's that is not we're almost almost out of time so okay let's keep it where i plonked it it was there okay okay i mean that was the best bridge that i could find find hey five thousand another good guess i'll i'll gladly take it alan chen alan chen is the author here who feels asian from the first glance let's have a look around taichung wait tai chung was was taichung in taiwan taichung yes taichung city indeed my memory might not be the best but i remember taichung lovely hearts cute cute rock in taichung so we are next to like a pretty big lake with fountains holiday inn express okay let's see if we can find taichung park maybe huh maybe this looks like a park holiday in express and it's it's like a lot of these businesses are in chinese um taichung park pavilion i mean this this does seem like it could fit there's like a bridge there like a bridge there there is something happening there is there like a circle here is this the circle or i'm not sure but we i think we are like on this green path somewhere around here okay a bit more to the east but it's another 5k nice okay i'll i'll i'm happy allen sito is the author ningaloo ningaloo coral bay oh i don't think i know where ningaloo is oh coral bay bay view reception i don't know where nongalu is i don't know where that is we said are we driving we're going with the left side yeah okay so i'm thinking we might be in like australia somewhere i mean coral sea is here so maybe somewhere around there is non-galoo coral bay non-galoo that's what i'm going by but i don't think i i can't remember here hearing about nongolu before not much time only 20 20 seconds remaining peter's island if nowhere else then let's guess peter's island if we can't find nongaloo okay it was australia just completely the opposite side yeah i could see the coral bay now interesting that the coral bay isn't next to the coral reef oh well but what what can you do what's the score 18 and a half thousand i mean okay okay score not the best but but definitely could be worse right let me know in the comments how did you do in these challenges did you beat me in any of these i'm really interested so and i do read all of the comments check out this play along video on the right side as well i think you will enjoy it huge thanks to all the patreons and members for supporting this channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest of your day be kind to one another and see you in the next video

which is a map containing weird unusual locations all around the world so let's begin to play along just click on the link in the description you don't need to have a pro account or anything just make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything so let's do one and a half minute no moving let's go let's go what do we have here oh wait a minute is this is this poland i remember like i went to poland now last year in 2021 and like there was like a weather station that looked similar to this i don't know this is that same one but it like had like ufo-shaped parts so it might be it i didn't i was looked from it uh from afar i wasn't next to it so so i don't know how it looks from from up close really but it looks very similar um it was like southern poland i don't remember where exactly was it like what's going on no no it wasn't quad score um [Music] can i can i find in my memories what was the name of that place if it even is that place i'm not sure ah almost almost i i didn't go with quan quadsco it was sneshka yeah it was all super close to the border indeed okay i i thought it looked familiar that's a good first round to start with i might have some pictures from it i don't know [Music] from from when i was in poland okay i have no idea where this is oh wait maybe this is like could this be like a god dracula or something in romania maybe maybe i don't know [Music] you're gonna like a weird dungeon or something like the yeah the quality is isn't good enough to read it this looks like cyrillic i mean although maybe this is like these look like some some graffitis and then unofficial writings so so from tourists possibly you cannot trust that interesting definitely interesting and this is official coverage by the way this should be all official coverage as is described in the map description yeah my best my best guess would be like like romania i don't know where there is like the the count dracula castle exactly that it was based on uh but but i don't know let's guess what was it was it buzau no oh i don't remember what was the name of the city where it was located in okay never mind it wasn't even romania it was some completely different rad hosca so castle castle maybe there's a i guess there must be a story behind that that's uh room if anyone knows leave it in the comments was a weird one i thought it was would be dracula so we are in belgium supposedly judging by the domain name there the license plates do appear to have some red characters as well so that would match with belgium also these signs orange sandbags are common in belgium as well so we are in belgium we know that much what's ridiculous uh here i'm not sure what's what's what's ridiculous i'm not sure what's ridiculous in this location uh maybe maybe the coverage got updated and the ridiculousness disappeared maybe this house is ridiculous there's something blurred out here not sure the time is ticking let's go i don't know brussels this looks like dutch so wherever this is in belgium it should be either brussels or like north northwest of brussels i think i think let's guess let's use brussels oh it was north west of brussels it was bruges i don't know how you said rouge i'm that's my guess bruges oh god you guys know i hate beach locations because i never know where to guess uh okay they have a okay they have electricity going over the um c i guess and this guy is fishing standing like like oh my god what what's happening here this is a weird one okay i guess it's common to fish like this here well yeah it does look quite uh not not very deep so i guess you do need to go quite deep in in the water to be able to fish where could this be my first thought was like maybe asia because this feels doesn't feel european i can tell you that much doesn't feel european with with all of what's happening here so i was thinking maybe like indonesia or or or malaysia this is official so so it shouldn't be like like demoralized timor-leste or anything like that maybe this is philippines actually maybe let's go philippines i like philippines there are lots of like islands small islands maybe some of them are connected with like electricity wires so let's just plonk it somewhere it was indonesia ah should have trusted my first first the first guess would have been much better okay so so apparently we were somewhere here and these small islands are connected by electricity wires apparently that's news to me that looked very weird and unsafe electricity going over water uh dot e s so okay and under this flag as well okay so so pretty sure this should be spain oh what's ridiculous here huh what again i'm not sure what's supposed to be ridiculous again maybe the ridiculous thing is blurred out possibly um yeah this is a spanish pedestrian crossing sign um lots of palm trees i think i'm thinking maybe barcelona okay i think i will go barcelona let's see could honestly could be any of these bigger cities i don't think it's madrid oh wow oh that's what that's why it was ridiculous not not about what we see but where it is i'm guessing it was toita yeah many people don't know i didn't know before i started playing geography that this is also part of spain like uh at the top of morocco there is like this spanish city and there is another one here somewhere this one right melia yeah a bunch a bunch of ships going going from here so yeah spain has two or three cities along this coast fun fact fun fact let's view the summary 16800 could be better it could be worse i'm kind of bummed out about my my fourth guess because if only i stayed in indonesia i would have had way more points there but what can you do let's do another one oh so challenge one and a half minutes let's go oh horsies cute horsies up these hats and like horse riding horseback riding um reminds me of like i don't know latin america mexico from movies maybe bolivia or something we have yellow reflectors which would make me think maybe chile i know in chile and spain they use yellow reflectors on these guardrails maybe they use yellow in other other places but i don't know about that then so i'm thinking could this be chile maybe um what is this are we is our horse pulling something i'm not sure i i would i would go chile i would go maybe somewhere like near here i think this might be a little bit north of santiago if the season is chile i'm just going by by the i don't know general feel and the yellow reflectors so let's see if i'm right yes nice it was a bit north of santiago a bit more south from where i guessed though but but i'm i'm happy with this guess i'm very happy with this guess second one oh a nice sculpture oh many ice sculptures so we have like a buddha here this looks like an exhibition based on this like plaque so so i'm not gonna think too much about this being buddha i know there's like an ice ice hotel in finland so could this be maybe part of the ice hotel that's probably my best guess at this point or was it was it norway no i think it was finland i mean to be fair there probably are multiple ice hotels in the world it's just i know about the one in in finland a lot of different ice sculptures here i think i think i have to go with finland i i don't really have any other guesses this is like a big cave where it isn't um honestly could be could be could be norway could be canada could be so many other places but i will go finland i will go let's go kind of in the middle for for hedging purposes okay i would have never guessed there to be honest i would have never guessed there yakutsk i mean russia makes sense but but it's just so remote and and yeah i would have never guessed there i didn't even know there was such such coverage there of such i don't know i'm guessing that was a museum um so okay okay that's why this is a ridiculous location i have had this location before but i don't remember where it was though i definitely remember this this name okay we do have uh the canadian flag here um we do have the canadian flag i don't know the other i probably should finally like uh muster up is that the expression and learn the canadian province flags because you see them a lot and they seem to be really helpful so so i probably should do that uh we do get kind of nordic looking houses here and and that that that and also i don't know the general feel would make me think like i don't know nova scotia new brunswick maybe maybe newfoundland um where is the water water is kind of to our south that doesn't really help the islands go all over the place it could be still anywhere can we can i maybe find this place um i remember seeing it was it where was it i was here it was here i i couldn't remember where where this place was okay maybe now i will maybe now i will remember but at least it was like the right area of the country around there okay a guy watching us um can we have an antenna on the google car first that was slovenia maybe white mountainous um with an antenna the trees i'm not the best at like uh flora but i think trees might fit with slovenia maybe it looks like we have like is this like part of maybe like a ski ski ski resort i don't know [Music] maybe not maybe not um oh we are right next to water i just noticed right next to water to our west so could this be like western slovenia somewhere here maybe oh wait i said western slovenia and i click on italy um could this be italy maybe actually this might be italy as well um since we have water right to our west i'm thinking like somewhere in this area maybe slovenia maybe italy so so let's guess somewhere here oh ah it was wait was this germany or no it was oh it was austria okay i mean austria makes perfect sense austria makes perfect sense too i was considering austria but but the water to our west made me go slovenia forgot about this lake okay we are in the desert is this the camel i know there is some camel camel coverage but i don't think it is i think this guy is just walking but i know there's in some parts of the world there is like a camel coverage you can see the google car google guys on a camel but but not this time where could it be architecture isn't helping me much the desert well of course obviously when i think of desert first thing that comes to mind is sahara who's black tunisia somewhere since tunisia has official coverage maybe there's the trekker as well that looks like this could be a different desert could not be might not be sahara or or could be egypt maybe egypt does have some tracker coverage as well i'm torn between tunisia and egypt here or this could be something completely different let's go egypt okay i'm switching to egypt maybe i shouldn't where is it let's see oh oh what japan what no way i would have guessed japan there okay it wasn't there it was those were sand dunes apparently i thought it's like a desert with like an oasis but no apparently it's tottori sand dunes oh well i was way over there no chance i would have guessed there okay this this is a very weird location indeed damn three pretty good good guesses and then those two way off i might not be getting the best scores in this map but uh i am i'm having fun so that's all that matters right we have some i think this is france oh hello i totally missed it from from the first view hello uh this is definitely france where do they have this city in france though i wonder huh the road number isn't really helping because in france the road numbers are just for for g i guess their purpose road numbers in france are useless completely um yeah and for unfortunately it's not gonna help us in any way and this this place is definitely too small for me to find it so there might be a phone number there but i cannot read it in france the phone numbers can be very helpful to to tell apart which region of france you are in um can you go by by the landscape let's maybe guess somewhere like eastern france maybe no it was southern france instead oh well so yeah here it is here it is oh geographic south pole oh this is an interesting one well we know that we are in south pole nice this is this is really cool this is really cool so there are a bunch of like research stations there and geographic south pole so where do they have geographic south pole oh god how do i find it um i know there are a bunch of research stations here like mcmurdo station but it wouldn't it's just a station it's not south pole like south pole oh wait we have like a map here maybe you can use this map we have this thing it's quite close to this thing huh i mean it should be like theoretically it should be right at the bottom here right right right if i understand how maps work uh let's try yes no 100 kilometers okay maybe no close close enough though for antarctica actually 4600 points is pretty good because it's enormous antarctica is huge let's go for the next round oh okay we have an antenna oh this is interesting is this russia this be russia we have a bunch of mountains we have white sand or like gravel or or i don't know um some greenery in the distance as well and some very dry look look trees no with no leaves maybe it's winter maybe that's why this is a tricky one huh um okay let's but my first thought was russia i by no means i'm confident about it i'm definitely not confident about it um but i'm thinking maybe it could be somewhere in eastern russia there are some mountains here i don't know let's go suck colleen maybe yeah italy didn't even cross my mind wow this is nice this is nice and this is official again i have seen official um mountain climbing locations in california and in alps could this be either one we trust i mean compass doesn't really help us either way california or alps or or maybe this is a different different mountain climbing location that i'm not aware of that's also a possibility i just have seen some in in um california and in in like was it i think it was somewhere here mont blanc somewhere there nearby i think is it could it be there let let's try it was california ah chose the wrong one god damn it yosemite yeah yosemite national park was the other one god damn it chose the wrong one i was yeah okay oh okay that's that's a ridiculous name indeed where is it so we have a us flag um od d oh that that's that uh means just a doctor right od does isn't like a state or anything it's just me like something doctor i think um what do we have here what else do we have alpine lodge well we're not near alps i can tell you that much not this time uh we don't have front plates which is interesting i don't know too many places that don't have front plates and a bunch of southern southern states don't have front plates but this doesn't feel southern to me um i think bunch of southern states didn't have i think some of these central states also didn't have them so could this be like illinois maybe or something no idea yeah like that that's okay michigan it is even more north that's another thing i want to learn study in 2022 is u.s license plates one thing is canadian province flags the other thing is u.s license plates that's that's another resolution of mine and like almost 12 000 points some of these guesses were way off way off i don't know i'm just i'm really having fun playing these so so i hope you're having fun either playing along or watching okay what the hell is this this is just just this poor quality uh location why is this even included well it's a tunnel i've seen tunnels in many countries before and geo guests are like in norway like um japan south korea like uh switzerland i think as well czechia or something or croatia yeah a bunch of countries that have tunnels and geo guests sir but but but but i don't i'm guessing norway norway is probably the main guess when you get tunnels if you can't move around oh god where was this madeira okay okay [Laughter] guys having a good time nice uh e bluff street so is this u.s or canada [Music] these triangular signs i think they were american or can you see them in canada too i'm not sure but i think they were american and the cars definitely look american these huge huge trucks in canada generally you see some more moderate cars more from from what i've noticed like something more like this but but but i would go like could this be i don't know like montana washington idaho somewhere here i'm thinking helena let's go helena oh no it was this time it was illinois okay this time it was illinois uh so what what's ridiculous here uh i don't see anything really ridiculous in this location so oh we have rifts so maybe maybe the location where we are itself like on the map maybe that's ridiculous so since we have some rifts only on one side nor it's on the other one uh and we have an antenna i am thinking uh montenegro or albania those countries usually have rifts if this is like a super weird location um could we be like on one of these islands maybe i don't know what's a weird place that we could be in does this island have coverage no no chance we are on that island and that that's that's greece already so let's go montenegro somewhere like here maybe i don't know how ridiculous it would be but but let's guess there um very close to the border in albania i don't know what's really what's really ridiculous there [Music] maybe that we are that close to the border not sure but okay oh what do you call these these flying animals oh god uh so google again another mountain climbing one another mountain climbing one but this doesn't feel like neither alps nor california so i think this might be something completely different i don't know like from the vibes my first thoughts for some reason was south africa like cape town so could we be near cape town i know there are a bunch of mountains here um so i was thinking maybe we are somewhere there not sure if we can trust this compass i mean it is official coverage so the compass should be right and if we can't trust it then we have water to our like south east signal hill so could it be like somewhere here kind of here we have kind of like a bay here sort of i'm not sure if this oh maybe could we be like no but there is no mountain here yeah i don't really know if this fits but okay it wasn't cape town wasn't cape town rio de janeiro another not the best round yeah these locations are tough i i yeah that's one of my weaknesses these um locations with with some weird weird weird coverage but we have yellow reflectors but this isn't chile we have a short antenna yellow lined in the middle very foggy very foggy as you probably have noticed very foggy indeed um i'm thinking i mean with it this antenna it could be brazil colombia ecuador or mexico um oh i'm not sure about the yellow reflectors my first thought was colombia or ecuador they are very mountainous so maybe this is somewhere very very high up with these like like um fences i know you see those fences a lot in um colombia and brazil so i don't know let's trust my first instinct i will go colombia i don't know where though like somewhere in like a mountainous part probably let's go i mean colombia is very mountainous in general but let's just kind of there in the middle mountainous and for hedging kind of there let's see if it is ah it was mexico it was mexico i was debating between colombia and brazil in the end but yeah mexico is definitely a possibility too okay and note to myself that mexico can also have yellow reflectors on the guardrails good to know good to know i'll try to remember that yeah i think this was my worst game of them all only 8 000 points but let me know in the comments how did you do and leave a like if you enjoyed this video i think you will enjoy this play along video where we play some games in the map of abandoned places huge thanks to all the patrons and members for supporting the channel i hope you all have a wonderful rest

play along let's do one and a half minutes no moving let's go let's go good luck just make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything looks like a nice nice christmas market feels very european to me very european um not latvia definitely not latvia quite small houses where where are these very narrow super narrow houses found i know you can get some very narrow houses in the uk but this is not uk like like uh santa's post what language is this polish podsta could this be poland costa coffee i know there is like some costa coffee in latvia so it would make sense that there will be one in poland posta or is this like czechia oh watch i'm between poland czechia and slovakia i'm torn between those three countries right now but i'm i'm gonna keep it in poland it was poland okay just the wrong city but i am happy with this i am happy with this not too far 4100 points good start so another christmas market what do we have now uh tarkul krachun cibu what language is that i i'm not sure what language that is nutcracker big christmas tree oh come on load load load they have both this like this accent and this accent what what i should probably recognize the language tran sylvania ah so this is romania i mean this okay okay where is transylvania though in romania god i never remember which which part of romania is transylvania i i always forget that was it like here or or am i tripping i i don't remember let's go brasov let's go brazov and then see if it is guess oh god okay it was a more to the south so maybe this was strong maybe not i don't know let me know in the comments it was cpu oh it did say cbu there i didn't realize that the name of the city i think it did say cpu on one of those signs didn't it but still 400 points not too bad not too bad at all a nice christmas tree again zonta zonta you like you leg lady uh what does it say oh my god the most useful sign is not readable fish sealed i cannot tell if this is like like norway or or sweden or denmark i don't think this is denmark let's go sweden maybe like like aurebro let's go kind of there maybe it was i was norway i was torn between sweden and norway here uh chose the wrong one unfortunately oh well oh well let's go next round okay not much snow here not much snow at all a nice nice christmas market though i really like the vibe of christmas markets i don't know feels like some there something special about them you know it almost looks like it says these something the um can't really tell can we see some royal christmas so it is english yeah i was thinking almost looks english royal christmas oh so this is this is uk is this london this could be london maybe one of the one of the parks in london don't know which one hyde park because it's behind park this isn't hyde park no um i don't know could be could be one of the other parks this park lincoln's in no no but my guess would be london maybe seriously what hog there was english all over the place what the royal christmas house why is it in english only seriously oh my god if you really really really pay attention it does say nl oh my god but everything is in english what that really took me by surprise this is in english this is in english it looked to me that this is in english wow okay that that definitely debated me that that surprised me for four christmas fair also in english like everything's in english oh my god okay okay at least that wasn't too far 3600 definitely could be worse uh we're getting uh everything in europe though i'm guessing your christmas markets are more common in europe probably oh i don't know maybe not maybe not um okay big well it's not london eye kind of similar though you don't see any language oh what do we do passage maybe the name of the city kroy i don't know where the city is if it's the name oh it's polish v something that croix croy is croy a city in poland kroy we have 10 more seconds i will try to find kroy though to the last second where is kroy i guess quite northern oh it was what no okay kroy wasn't the city okay okay we're adjusting dansk just being nice 4200 i think overall i did pretty okay 19 and a half thousand points yeah my biggest furthest one was the swedish one okay but let's do another one let's do another one so challenge same settings let's go again europe i don't know maybe all of these locations are in europe um could this be like estonia maybe or or finland i don't know it doesn't feel entirely like feel like like like estonia but maybe wait no maybe it is a stoney oh god i don't know i was thinking like in tartu they had like a similar kind of statue but no this isn't tart too it looked different in tartu but i'm thinking could this be tallinn or maybe or is it just just finland let's see stalin if it is finland then we are not too far away so let's get stolen it was okay it was finland it was helsinki well had kind of the right uh thought process so yeah still decent decent score 4600 again getting a lot of 4600s in this uh this map love republic that doesn't really oh wait what is this language okay this might not be europe looking at the language what is that language the language i don't know the language feels like could it be armenia or azerbaijan with this language armenian [Music] is kind of similar azerbaijan [Music] no so armenia maybe yerevan could it be any other clues maybe we can find again the same same language i don't know if that's the cup that's some flag not sure um okay let's let's guess let's go see here nice good guess my best guess of the day let's go right in the middle of the other one only four points lost good guys good guys be letter b letter very terlan of winterland winterland okay a nice like like a skating rink winterland winterland vinterland billeter sounds quite dutch to me i don't know maybe i'm wrong but the language looks dutch all i see is vinterland no other text readable greece i don't know but the language feels very touched to me should we let's just guess in amsterdam kind of kind of in the middle oh no it was okay i was wrong on the language okay it was oslo so it was it was norwegian then ouch ouch that that's my furthest that's my worst guess of the map today ouch ouch ouch lost 3 000 points there like this this huge huge cathedral or whatever that is you know this this gives me like almost like scottish vibes but but i don't know can we see some language please any any language at all the quality the author is giovanni figulo figuello oh my god i can't read figly warlord could this be italy if the author's name is giovanni maybe this is italy could could this be italian like i don't know maybe okay let's let's guess italy i don't know like milan maybe oh my god it was scotland geo what is giovanni doing in in scotland oh no like i was literally saying the architecture looks scottish oh yeah wait we had this already oh god where was it my memory no wait this isn't wait was this the polish one no oh yeah it was kroy it was dusk it was dunsk somewhere yes yes it was yes it was okay at least i remembered this one seventeen thousand ah the scottish one is is really bugging me okay let's let's play again carlo dubai cafe very pretty christmas tree um charo via notes the quality is so bad we can't even see those flags slovenska i think it says slovenska there guys sk yeah yeah yeah it is slovakia would this be bratislava or is this a different city i don't know could be a big city so like big big castle there could be could be bratislava i think yeah i guess let's just guess bratislava i was not bratislava it was but still at least i got the country right i'm happy with that oh chocolate we see english again but as as we learned in that one of the previous rounds you cannot trust english audion oh no what the hell is that something very creepy like the quality the author author is mr wildy mr wildy where are you from ah is that pounds that kinda looks like pounds five pounds each i think it looks like five pounds each so okay so i guess this is actually uk again it could this be london don't know let's go like manchester instead let's go manchester it was london i'm making all the bad the bad decisions in this video guys oh rip all the bad decisions for some reason i thought it wouldn't be london okay some very beautiful mountains here why not so germany why not is the christmas miracle peter i'm thinking like probably southern germany i would imagine with these mountains somewhere like like or could wait could this be austria this might be austria oh god i forgot about austria this might be austria with some tram tracks this is a large city with tram tracks let's go austria let's go innsbruck again i heard innsbruck in my previous video that i filmed let's go innsbruck it was innsbruck let's go hey nice only five points lost nice guess nice guess what do we have here christmas christmas man santa christmas man i've never heard anyone call santa christmas man barbell barbell something vien brule i don't know what language that is we see some palm trees so this is a very warm place but not warm enough that people are still wearing huge jackets i mean hmm could this be italy i don't know i i wish i could see more language i really can't tell much from from what i can see like the architecture could be italian maybe the mountains also would make sense the palm trees would make sense so maybe let's go below in bologna i don't know i never i never learned how to pronounce it in english it was italy it was srinto trinto okay at least they get the right country oh the right area as well pretty good pretty good the last round of the game pharmacy all tourist transport so english english is this supposed i guess this is supposed to be a snow melting um yeah no actual snow i'm thinking could this be malta or monoco maybe we see a lot of like fancy fancy boats here could this be monocle maybe i'm feeling either malta or monocle hmm with all of these super fancy fancy boats kind of more inclined to go with monaco but yeah in any language not really well besides this english i mean these are touristy signs so doesn't mean much uh do we go malta oh god i'm so torn between the two okay let's switch to malta let's switch to malta oh god maybe i shouldn't have switched was it malta or is it monaco or is it something completely different it was yes okay it was malta thank god i switched this time switching paid as off switched because of english the english sign i was thinking okay maybe maybe maybe it is more likely to be malta with an english sign completely english okay let's view the summary and 20 i mean this is my best score yet my worst guess here was that that london london manchester won 22 and a half thousand okay let's go for one last one last run challenge same settings oh this is a lot of pretty light uh what is that rettan oh like like merry christmas and happy new year i imagine nova means new in in many languages novi lodge blonde huh what is this letter b lodge is that a b i guess that's a b ball [Music] i don't know i'm thinking like could this be like bosnia i don't know around bosnia somewhere bosnia herzegovina croatia slovenia somewhere there serbia let's go sorry evo i really don't know but the from the language i'm thinking maybe somewhere around here one of these languages possibly it was croatia okay it was kind of in the right right area so close close lost 1 000 points but we can work with that we can work with that oh at first i was i thought wait is it it is it is latvia okay i was thinking at first i thought it was latvian then i thought no it's not latvia then then i realized it is latvia okay i know exactly where this is i have been uh to these christmas markets numerous times and it is right so where is it god where is it come on leave a look these dooms here um so where exactly are we okay kind of like year-ish right i think right kinda here 21 meters away okay pretty good pretty good 5k next huh i cannot really read but it is german i'm pretty sure so either germany or austria or switzerland maybe not much to go but we did have some like a mountain nearby i'm thinking could be switzerland maybe maybe no real clues besides the language besides the german language i really don't see anything else much useful but i thought maybe the writing is something useful but no let's guess maybe like eastern switzerland kind of like hedging this area somewhere here it was i was salzburg in austria okay makes sense yeah makes sense i mean we're not doing terribly this this game but not doing very well either mood mood music museum oh that's a romanian flag isn't it yeah a bunch of these flags a bunch of these flags nice nice like nice fountain of light that's really cool really pretty seems like a small town seems like a pretty small town so i don't know small town in romania let's go target [Music] maybe let's go there and it was brasov okay it wasn't that small of a town wasn't that small of a town okay last round what is this le der varen german again nurenerberg where was nuremberg here we go nurnerberg nurenberg close enough i think is it i don't know maybe that's a different city but this doesn't seem like a pretty big city right [Music] is it the same as nuremberg i can't tell if it's the same or not i mean this is a pretty big city it seems so would make sense right right okay let's make a guess i i i don't have anything better than that okay it was right it was right and i was only 200 meters away let's go right in front of hawaiian kirusha let's see the summary 21800 not bad the last few rounds were much better if you enjoyed this video i think you will like this play along video as well on

flags of the world map my regular viewers probably already know that i'm not the best at flags but i have been doing some practicing let's see if the practice pays off i don't know we'll see so let's do challenges with no moving and let's say minute minute and a half so we can look around without a rush the links will be in the description you don't need a pro account to play along so just watch the video after you play it so it doesn't spoil it oh i have definitely seen this flag oh which one was it it was kind of similar to madagascar but it wasn't madagascar was it like gabon i still don't know all of the african flags i still don't know a lot of african flags i have studied some of them though um was it gabon let's see maybe we can find some other other clues gene royal i cannot read what it says unfortunately down there um okay ko so speaking english kind of speaking english but with some kind of like some french accents as well driving on the right side of the road does gabon drive on the right on the or the left i think they drive on the lot on the right we have 20 seconds we can quickly zoom in libraville you can sometimes see those arrows yeah okay we are driving on the right side of the road good um so it could be could be gabon in terms of the driving side at least i don't see any other clues around what is this gabon like no oh no it was benin ah oh no oh no bad start bad start but okay we we can do this oh this is honduras right i used to mix up all of these um central american flags but then someone in my chat told me that the stars kind of look like an h later if that makes sense so so ever since then i remember that this one is honduras uh that it isn't necessarily in the capital let's have a look around this does look kind of like a like a big place with with a lot of houses down downhill so i would probably imagine that this is the capital we can't trust the compass though since this is an unofficial coverage um pretty big monument so if it is around the capital maybe we can find it kind of like like a circular big monument [Music] maybe somewhere here this is kind of like hilltop views it's going to look like a circle here doesn't feel right though but we don't have much time only only 13 more seconds that's a golf course i think i think i'll keep the plonk there see if that's it was right that's a 5k let's go it didn't feel right i thought that the whole structure would be on the map but i guess this time it wasn't fair enough so i was right about the the hilltop views good so that that's that's a that's a good redemption around after the first one okay we have a kazakhstan flag in uh like kazakh language it says kazakhstan here responding uh okay anyways so this is this this is a big big big landmark i have seen it before i mean it must be must be the capital of nur sultan um [Music] pretty big building what is this building i can't really academic some sort of academy academy i think maybe maybe um do we see where it's like a river is or something [Music] not really we only see this big big thing well this one surely is on the map right it should it should be since it's pretty i think it's like a famous landmark this one maybe maybe that's this one so although this isn't official let's assume the compass is correct maybe although wait oh is this no this isn't presidential palace [Music] okay we were right there oh it says national academy academic library oh i totally missed this one okay so it might have been that tower then yeah i guess it was i was just thinking we probably are a little bit further away from it but still only two points lost that's that's a good round in my book um willie kaimena is the author always pays to to look at the author author's name sometimes it gives something away um where is the flag oh here is the flag oh oh this flag it is dominica right i think that's the dominican flag not dominican republic just dominican i i'm pretty sure that's the one i couldn't find the flag at first it's very well hidden here um so we are right next to like like a like a port where crew cruise ships uh port oh this is this i have seen this ship before i think with this like big face at the front so we have like a like an a part of the island there i'm assuming this is like the capital somewhere like here maybe we would see this like part of the part of the island there do we see any anything here it could help garway hotel garway hotel is here a cruise ship cruise ship birth okay we should be like here right here 15 meters away let's go let's go nice nice that's a good guess only 15 meters away but another 5k that's that's great to see oh no okay i oh no okay i do not recognize this flag i'll be honest i can't see it properly first of all maybe if i saw it properly maybe i would recognize it but but but um that's a big maybe i'm not even sure i can see it's the kind of colors of the flag but but um yeah i mean this is an african nation with black blades driving on the opposite side so if we are driving on the opposite side it means that we are kind of like in in this area somewhere here is this the flag with like the diagonal stripe across it um wasn't tanzania tanzania looked different muslim be no zombie no zombie it didn't have a diagonal stripe did it i'm still i'm still learning the flags okay i'm still learning did congo have stripes i don't remember which side congo drives though let's let's have a quick glance can we see which side are they driving on sometimes you get those arrows sometimes you don't on the road okay we're driving it looks like on the right side in congo okay i'll keep it somewhere like see malawi did i switch to malawi in time i don't know oh oh it was guiana i was completely wrong okay i didn't do that drive on the left side in guyana i had no idea they drive on the left side in guyana that's that's news to me i really thought the whole whole of south south america drives on the right side okay learning something new here damn okay the last round was by far the worst by far the worst let's look at the summary game breakdown yeah only two points in the last one the other ones the first one was also like so so but i'm very happy with the middle three rounds i am very happy with that let's do another game let's do another game same settings let's keep going let's see what other flags do we get oh this is uh not ireland very similar flag to ireland this is uh ivory coast or cote d'ivoire basically the same colors as ireland except like the other direction ireland starts with green because the war starts with orange um looks like a pretty big place i don't know what what this is maybe like a like a some sort of a presidential palace or something with flags around and then fancy cars hmm i'm guessing again is is this is the capital right oh no this is the cap i always mix those capitals uh those cities up because abi abidjan is the biggest city but the capital is here i mean this photo sir might be might be in the biggest city not the capital these locations don't necessarily need to be in the capital but i think our best bet a residence presidential something like presidential residence is here doesn't look like by the grid that it matches but my first thought was this this might be like presidential palace so i think that's where i will guess i hope it doesn't turn out to be abby john okay okay so it wasn't the presidential bus it was just a hotel just just just a random hotel but still good score at least i guess the right guess the right city could i have found it uh probably not probably not to be honest uh let's move on so what do we have there are so many flags we have flag of sachalese france uh maldives look like this one was oh god i don't remember which one was this but there are so many flags which one is the real one oh is this this is reunion okay when i saw the i saw this plate i was thinking damn that looks like a french plate and i mean reunion is a french overseas territory and if you get reunion another good clue is that this tape on the back of the uh google car railings in ghana you get tape on the front one in reunion you get tape on the uh back uh railing and the reunion is right here it's a very small island uh saint pierre on st paul good question good question i guess that explains why there were so many french flags there i have a big like a column small roundabout can we find to find a small roundabout with a big column [Music] if we had a bit more time then maybe maybe we could find it but i was all the way here saint dennis us i guess is saint dennis like the biggest city i thought it was saint paul there isn't even oh here is that oh my i would not have found this roundabout it is so small doesn't even look like a roundabout from up here especially with this like hotel in front of it no way i would have found it okay but still only only 100 points lost that's still a pretty great score in my book this looks like israel all yellow plates light colored houses we have some israeli flag on the plate where is the original flag there should have been a flag oh here is the oh totally missed it here we have an israel israel flag um okay f this doesn't look like a like a famous place or anything so this could be anywhere in like tel aviv i'm assuming this probably is tel aviv because up until now or maybe jerusalem up until now the the locations have been in the capital so i am guessing that this is jerusalem instead possibly in jerusalem i would actually expect to see some white plates as well but i see none but but i will still guess against jerusalem i think so let's get somewhere here it was jerusalem okay only three points lost pretty good pretty good next round okay this is a moldova right okay motorway is a very interesting country i would like to visit very interesting um so now so this is like a like a park with a church in the middle park with a church in the middle cathedral park huh triumvarge yes that works there is the art our an archway here so you're right next to triumph arch right where they where the roads meet basically so kind of here it's four meters away let's go let's go great guess let's move on okay this is north macedonia we have a flag up there and we are on a river i have had this location before i don't remember which which which um bridget this was a bunch of like like famous people on the bridge with a big famous person in the middle okay so let's go to north macedonia to skopje there's a river is this stone bridge that seems to be the bigger bigger one bridge of art maybe this is a bridge of art it does look pretty artsy like a lot of like like other like maybe they are artists bridge of art let's zoom in art bridge art bridge what do we have here what is this do we see what this house is look like a circular is this it if i had to guess right now i would guess like somewhere here but but what can we maybe quickly not there i don't see any better bridges than that i don't see any other better better bridges so so let's go with that one okay nice it was the bridge the we are eight meters away off nice i'm doing actually really well when i do recognize the flag i am doing very well so mother teresa square that was okay let's view the summary okay this is this is a much much better score than the first game 24 884 let me know in the comments how how are you doing in these challenges and leave a like on this video if you enjoy these play along uh challenges it really helps out the channel let's have a look oh this is is this a portuguese flag i don't know this one hmm [Music] what do we have george gergia no girgis george gergis is the author is that a portuguese flag or what is that flag i don't recognize this one so i'm guessing that might be like a local one maybe that i see some green and red it definitely definitely doesn't feel like lisbon to me i don't know hmm this doesn't feel entirely like portugal but i really don't know what else to guess here so i might as well guess lisbon but it doesn't feel like it okay let's let's guess it okay it was portugal but it was azores okay okay i mean it makes sense makes sense it did look like quite tropical and i guess those those other flags might have been like the flag of azores or something maybe if you know let me let me know in the comments because i don't i did not recognize that other one oh this is the flag of saint lucia i do recognize this one rbc royal bank wasn't rbc like a canadian bank or am i wrong i thought rbc was like a canadian bank maybe they have a canadian bank in saint lucia uh i i i i don't know but yeah this should be saint lucia hey baz heba's center with a bank duty-free shop okay we have like some like a smart like smell like square here [Music] i don't see any any greenery i mean maybe it isn't green on the map maybe it's a different city it does look like a pretty big city so it should be like trees the capital but i i don't see any green squares that would match oh okay my completely random plunk in the in the middle of a building uh resulted in a 5k that was random oh there is like a square here but it's completely gray so so i was looking for like something green at first so that's why i didn't notice this square okay makes sense and i was still in the in the distance to get a 5k so like very lucky very lucky ah the big tree the big tree it was lebanon right oh the girls are also wearing flags so even more flags around this is the lebanese flag i'm pretty sure oh like a pretty very big mosque here very big mosque and we do see water and like some statue near water okay we can try to use that so i'm guessing this is probably berut um again we cannot really trust compass i mean the water is to our north east if we did trust compass i mean that is possible that is definitely possible let's see if we can find like some statues or mosques near near the water oh there's musk here some some square downtown route modern autonomy modern ottoman influenced mosque maybe i don't see the shape of the mosque here is there like an intersection there is an intersection right next to us this is like a yeah two-way str like a street with like a separator in the middle so it kind of works i mean we don't have much time i think this is misplaced i think this is just misplaced because we're because we certainly were not there i think i i 5k did but the the photo sphere just was uploaded a little bit with wrong coordinates i'm guessing because yeah like this makes no sense uh no other sense but okay let's move on we are in china oh this is the is this the forbidden palace i'm guessing um i have seen this location in geoguessr before now i just need to find it where was it here i'm guessing kind of in the middle oh mausoleum of mao zedong okay here it is so this isn't forbidden palace i guess this is mausoleum of mao zedon i i think monument to the people's heroes yup i guess that's the one then we have is the enemy square somewhere there i don't know i have like a big big building to our west there is a big building the great hall of people wait the great wall hall of people we are kind of like if we are guiding ourselves by the great hall of people we should be somewhere here then huh oh no there wait there's a different way which building is this no it is the great hall of people right the building matches nice okay so we are in tinderman square so 5 000 points nice let's go good guess good guess um so we have again lebanese flag oh and what is the other flag i have had this location before i remember that i guess lebanon and who wasn't lebanon i remember that much and i don't remember what this flag was whatever this other flag was that that was the country but i don't remember which country we have like somewhere is french speaking um i am guessing one of these countries here in this area not liberia not got the war not sierra leone or i i don't know i'm guessing somewhere here maybe i'm guess yeah anyway i don't know let's see might be somewhere else in africa uh it was brazzaville brazzaville in republic of the congo did not recognize it unfortunately let's go let's go for the last game another challenge let's go what is this one this looks like a german flag but this is like an embassy no we see some arabic here like there are three languages here one of them being arabic another being german probably and maybe english well this isn't germany so why are you getting is that i mean it is a german flag jordan i was thinking jordan right so where the hell are we getting a german flag in jordan i i i didn't think this map is supposed to be tricking us but okay let's let's guess jordan i don't know where in jordan there is a german embassy i'm guessing in amman would make sense for a german embassy to be there you see like a very big part of city to our kind of south um southeast so maybe let's just kind of hear ish okay it was west bank okay why did why did they say george down then what what what was it oh it was jordan east bank okay makes sense i mean you can't have jordan's bank in other countries sure i was not thinking west bank to be honest i was not thinking west bank okay i mean it wasn't too far but still doesn't explain the german flag why why why is this this is latvia guys yeah why was the map trying to trick us that i think that's the first first one where they are trying to trick you with the flag very very central mcdonald's as well if you want to want to go have a have a snack yeah let's oh here so previous beaming necklace is here bulk tennis lima is here so we are like right uh like from this path coming from this path like basically we are here you're kind of kind of all close to the middle of the road gonna go basically like here nice two meters two meters very close i mean i should recognize it right um so okay this is another one of the central american ones well i know it's not honduras i know that much um which one is it though which one of the other ones is it um any any other clues maybe okay the the author is protocol 360 against the marketing unfortunately the marketing agency doesn't contain the country they are from in the name i don't know i was thinking like maybe like el salvador this is like a hilly place san salvador is a hilly city maybe i know it's not honduras i'm basically between el salvador and nicaragua this is one of the two because i think i'm pretty sure they both had like blue white blue except with something different in the middle let's go el salvador okay it was el salvador good guessed correctly guessed correctly nice let's go oh was it turkmenistan or no tajiki no oh no turk it wasn't turkmenistan turkmenistan had a different one was this tajikistan one of the stans i think stan countries so let's go let's go tajikistan then because i think turkmenistan had a different one this looks like a very random flag post like this looks like a pretty small neighborhood and then there is this huge huge flag post in the middle of like a roundabout kind of random a little bit let's go is it the capital i don't know we did have a couple of a couple of locations where it wasn't in the capital so who could be could be elsewhere as well but i will still guess like the capital city iraq oh so was it like like like uh like a kurdish flag or something yeah i just googled it it turns out it was flag of kurdistan which is like like uh area around here uh i thought it was the jikistani tajikistan has like similar colors i will i will show those flags on the screen so you can see kind of close close colors close in terms of flags but not so much in terms of the uh distance this is sri lankan flag which people were mad because they rated it pretty low in my flag rating video which i believed in the info card people got mad mad about that video so but yeah this is sri lanka so looks quite quite central big like kind of white house style building with with with like a buddha statue next to it in front of it so i'm guessing colombo can we find colombo is a big city so can we find wherever this this place is i'm not sure what this place is this could be a museum this could be like a government building so i don't really know what to look for oh that works just as i say i don't know what to look for i just noticed this like a kind of building that fits on on the map i mean this this big park grabbed my attention because i see i do see a big park here so i mean what wasn't as difficult as i had imagined to find it so we have we are right next looking for right in front of it look here not really on the road but with like okay nice nice so another 5k a lot of 5ks in this video which i'm happy about so 20 700 points so the only only bad with pretty bad guess was the the fourth one i think you will enjoy this video on the right side where i try to recognize some odd flags of the world huge

contains locations in china this is sort of like an extension to geoguesser that it uses like a custom script that takes coverage from baidu street view so it will not be google street view it will be chinese equivalent for that could be exciting i have not played it before uh the only china coverage i've had is in like hong kong and macau let's try to do it as challenges but if you want to play along keep in mind that you do need to install a custom script which is like a list linked right here at the map description let's do the challenge as one minute and 30 seconds and with moving around i think it still will be pretty difficult because i have no idea how like different parts of china feel could be exciting could be exciting oh okay it's not loading yet okay had to had to wait for a second had to wait for a second for it to start to look okay and this is how it looks this is how it looks um [Music] basically a a street in china what do we have here we have can we get closer well it's not like a i can try to read the english part oh god okay i cannot read well we have some some chinese flags here okay yeah like google street you feels way more fluent if that makes sense this is very jumpy not very fast to load uh yeah baidu um yeah in china they use uh blue license plates which part of china do i think it is it's not like i'm finding any useful hints here so i have to have to go purely from from the the vibes which i have none because i've never played this map before okay let's go kind of small buildings not not central i don't think it would be near beijing maybe like somewhere like hanan somewhere somewhere hanan china is so huge but it's it's crazy so could be worse could be worth sixteen hundred uh and seventy nine points still 693 kilometers away and i don't even know which parts of china have coverage which ones don't i'm assuming there are probably some parts like some deserts and stuff mountains that have no coverage but okay so that was the first round the second round uh okay i was thinking it probably isn't loading immediately because we had the same location okay this this looks different oh god the quality is not the best kind of i'm getting like unofficial coverage vibes from geo gesture like this is kind of kind of the same same ballpark as unofficial coverage on on google street view so so yeah probably we won't be able to read most of the texts the moving around is very sloppy but at least we can explore china even though the quality isn't the best it's cool to see how china looks because that's not something you can really experience in google street view so something new and i hope you enjoy it as well because i know i do even though my scores will be terrible i do think this is pretty cool the time is running out this is like a very new neighborhood i know they're like like built like to build a lot of houses in china so this is like freshly built in the middle of nowhere um okay this is this is like you are guessing this is more like just just looking at lishui let's go nearly shui again somewhere kind of kind of where we had the previous one maybe it's somewhere near oh wow wow it was that wow it was that far south i didn't realize that it was coastal wow okay damn i would have expected to for such a coastal place to be to have more buildings but i guess they are building those buildings now damn interesting interesting so what was the name place called bagong so it was baegong okay okay uh so what what will be the next one let's wait for a second for it to load okay okay we are in a bigger city it seems well a little bigger city police does it say oh google car well baidu car is visible um i was thinking does it have like some some city name maybe well maybe it does no i'm guessing this means police as well well obviously i don't know any like like like crests this might be the city name i i used to study some mandarin back in the day but very little and then i'm not that good for for to read anything so so yeah i cannot read anything anything of that um yeah nothing helpful this kind of i'm getting like yeah almost like like kind of a little bit of kyrgyzstan vibes and the same same feeling obviously different different cars different language but but kind of similar architecture similar like trees for me at least it seems that way it's probably like some school we're running out of time again um let's go kind of like canaan again this time maybe it is this time oh wow it was oh it was that far north wow i i guess it makes sense maybe i mean yeah like kind of kyrgyzstan mongolian vibes makes sense that it would be that close to mongolia okay okay so 280 points uh not very good can we reach 5 000 points in total in this game oh this oh this is cool some sort of a horse maybe some some mythological creature or something okay can we can we find some maybe road like like signs to some nearest cities well it seems that nothing is in english unfortunately which makes sense but it doesn't make things easier unfortunately um and yeah the moving around is super sloppy i want to get to that sign just to look how it see how it looks but i just can't i just can't um where where do i where can i even go now i think this might be the dead end uh yeah it again it makes me appreciate google street view more now after looking at this i do appreciate how how more convenient it is to to move around in google street view like it might have some english text there but it is too far away and the quality is too poor for me to see maybe this could be somewhere near beijing with such a such a big statue pure speculation okay no it was near nanjing nanjing so what was that statue does it say uh no no it doesn't just a regular intersection no statues in on the map so maybe just a regular horse just a statue for some random horse then okay and the last round of this game oh wow oh this is a big building cool architecture kind of like a wave maybe this is coastal then if the building is like shaped similar like like a wave maybe this is a coastal city not that it helps a lot because china is a huge coastline so it would be cool to find some some actual hints oh what do we have here oh god we can't moving around is killing me um [Music] again like lots of building new buildings we have some mountains to our kind of east we have mountains to our east um would be handy to know where in china we have mountains a lot big lots of big big buildings to our wait building store east wait that was all the compass isn't working oh we have compass up here okay so we have mountain stork in the northeast and okay regular okay i just just now realized that the regular let's go kind of here i don't know here jejung um we just now realized that the regular google compass isn't working we have to look at that one up there uh there is a different compass uh it was a lie lie bean it was not coastal so i mean it wasn't too far but what wasn't as coastal as i had imagined and i guess there are some mountains i i mean makes sense that there would be some mountains to the north from here yeah okay so 667 points i don't think we got five thousand points yeah forty four hundred uh forty four hundred seventy two points um okay let's play again let's play again let's play again challenge one minute 30 moving aloud not like it helps us a lot but but maybe in one of these rounds moving will will help out okay loading loading what do we have okay it's very dark coverage very dark coverage gonna kind of maybe maybe fill photos are taken in the evening here or early in the morning um everything's in chinese yeah i mean no no surprise there no surprises there everything is in english in chinese nothing is in english probably if we see some english it's probably a good indication that it might be like a touristy place if we see some english but but we don't here so that doesn't help pretty i think this feels pretty like a little bit hilly but nothing mountainous or anything well this part of china is very mountainous right and i think there are some mountains up here somewhere or maybe he like this place looks mountainous but i think it was flat here it was flat here i think maybe here a little bit hilly oh i blocked it just at the last second i didn't realize how little time i have okay applied plant plonked near nanjing it was a little bit to the north west pretty good score i would say pretty good score yeah this was kind of i think kind of a little bit like a flatter flatter place in china if i remember correctly i'm definitely not sure about that don't quo don't quote me on that as they say okay again kind of getting like like mongolian vibes here from from the the buildings from the overall feel kind of like wintry feel maybe it's just because yeah it is it is like a winter coverage maybe that's why it feels kind of kind of like mongolian vibes or kyrgyz vibes oh wait what is that sign does that help us in any way or is it is it all in chinese it oh there is some english i don't know what to make of it i don't know what to make of we have some english some chinese is one of them simplified one of them traditional i'm so confused now this sign made me so confused because i was thinking it might be somewhere up here could this be like near beijing maybe maybe that's why it is like in three languages what what i was thinking somewhere up here but why would there be english up there right okay i would guess somewhere maybe a little bit north of beijing again kind of maybe a little bit of mongolian vibes oh it was ah it was the beijing itself oh okay okay that explains that explains why little to beijing almost 200 kilometers and damn yeah china is enormous uh but yeah 3600 points uh very happy with that so i already beat my the score of my previous round a previous game so yeah makes sense makes sense should have should have gone with beijing with seeing that english so okay so beijing can have sort of like like uh like mongolian vibes some parts of beijing at least that's what that's what i'm learning yeah this is my first time playing this map i'm learning along with you guys i guess you guys are ex like seeing many of you are seeing china for the first time too i would imagine so quite exciting quite exciting but i don't know where this is there's like a bigger road look like a bridge but we can't really get on to it the other the moving around is is my biggest criticism about all of this so sloppy feels yeah not the greatest experience there is like a phone number i wonder if that could help oh my god that's a such a long phone number oh my god uh where do we guess where we guess let's guess kind of kind of somewhere here g g g none near g none okay wasn't jin r but definitely could be worse it was above north korea north of north north korea okay fourth round uh but yeah those phone numbers make sense like the country has like uh 1.4 billion people or something i don't even know how many makes sense that the phone numbers would be long i'm kind of getting like a little bit of like thai vibes like thai or like somewhere there cambodia vietnam kind of those vibes a little bit so my first thought would be that it might be somewhere like nearby here is these like fields and and and i don't know how to explain trees maybe i'm not very good at like trees like distinguishing trees and flora and stuff i'm just going by the vibes just just the vibe connoisseur okay we have chinese flag guessing maybe one of those are like like uh province flags i think we just guessed somewhere like somewhere here no was not kunming it was gung sho gang zhou ah i thought i had it i thought i had it i thought it looked so similar to to thailand it must be somewhere there i guess not uh oh we have some water to our south west it looks like a is that a big river or is it a bay could it be like maybe this bay but but it is to our south south west oh god this compass is confusing uh the bay is going i don't know if it's a river or a bay somewhere there here maybe foshan gonna i mean we have some a lot of palm trees so i would think that it is like like kind of southern part of china somewhere um let's keep it there i think maybe a little bit like let's move it more a little bit more east i don't know if i did it in time it was okay not not too bad it was like southern part of china it was siamen let's see i mean okay it was like a bay port siemens fair enough fair enough but i'm pretty happy with this guess pretty happy let's do the summary i think this was a very good game very good game nine thousand eight eight hundred points um chinese pro almost almost a chinese pro okay let's go for one more game third time's the charm let's see if we can beat our our score okay let's go hmm again like kind of kind of like feels like northern china to me so kind of kind of mongolian vibes if that makes sense i'm getting kinda mongolian vibes in summer maybe i don't know maybe yeah i haven't played china enough for for like proper vibes to start start like like happening i um i'm just going going by by what i think china looks like not not how not from my actual experience um so i'm thinking maybe we're like somewhere here wait wait a little bit west of uh beijing still close to mongolia but maybe maybe not here maybe somewhere around here that's kind of my feeling is that feeling right i think we might as well make a guess some very high buildings though maybe it's a bigger city although they build these high buildings everywhere so okay let's okay i switched to a little bit closer to beijing in the last second it was jinan kind of in the general area it was south of beijing not west of beijing but i'm pretty happy with that guess 2200 points in the first round pretty good okay we have some sort of a is that a temple or what is that i'm not sure um okay um a road to nowhere cool so it's such a pretty big road and it literally just stops with like nothing no science just the road just stops what the hell things you see in china i guess um i guess this is one of the new neighborhoods they have just built road just there's nowhere else to go further no point in continuing the road i guess definitely very interesting but where it kind of feels south like it's does it feel southern i don't know to me i don't know these this like style of like lanterns this style of buildings again like feels kind of kind of myanmar uh like burmese la la ocean this style of this this building the these lanterns i might might be wrong again oh god how wrong i was wow i would have never guessed up there i didn't even know there was coverage there wow wow okay yeah literally in the middle of nowhere mongol autonomous county wait what is hobok sir mongol autonomous county wait so does this begul belong to [ __ ] mongols mongol autonomous county if you know it please leave it in the comments i'm very interested what's what's happening here oh but yeah obviously only 36 points there oh this looks very similar okay did it not load did it not reload is it glitching maybe it is glitching let's reload loading load yeah okay yeah it was glitching i was thinking no chance we get this wait we had this oh freaking hell where was this my memory my memory we literally had this this was the first round today right this is the very first round today oh was it not nanjing i think it was somewhere around here i don't know if it was nanjing or i think it was somewhere here i think we might well or was it a hung show it was a little bit north of hangzhou i think it was somewhere around here let's make a guess and see no so either i remembered wrongly or the coverage was glitched and it showed something different both are possibilities maybe i just misremembered knowing my memory it is entirely possible what do we have now again some some pretty epic lanterns street lights pretty epic street lights but different style different style than than those in the north the far northwest different style little bit mountainous okay we can't move in that direction is the road not finished no it is it is going further we just can't go there okay yeah a little bit hilly with hmm yeah i don't know what to think of this one these lanterns feel streetlights feel feel weird like where are people supposed to walk by the way i'm just thinking like i'm seeing these people walking on just in the middle of the road like pedestrian pedestrian like like uh pavement it's just just like all whole trees and like metal bars so so they can't walk on the pavement have to walk on the road that's weird i just just realized that seeing people walking on the road um it's a little bit hilly to our north let's go oh i didn't oh it was literally clicking here oh no oh my god it would have been such a good guess like i was seeing mountains all around that's why i was thinking maybe let's go somewhere guess somewhere here ah i didn't register in time i clicked a little bit too late oh that's such a bummer i think it would would have been my closest guest today ah that sucks that sucks uh but what can you do okay this is like a pretty big city with like some some glass skyscrapers and stuff so is this beijing or like shanghai or which one of the big cities is this something china there maybe ba or bank of china does it say the city maybe somewhere on the bank of china but the tree is in the in our way min shang is min shang a city it sounds like it might be i have not heard of min shang before min shang bank oh my god and china has so many cities there's no chance i found it find min shang unless it is really big maybe it's somewhere near beijing means shang i don't see mean shank i don't even know if it is a city might even not be a city name let's get near beijing maybe and and then hope for the best okay it was oh it was shenyang okay so mincheng was not the name of the city what was mean shang then yeah it is mean shank but maybe it's just the name of the bank i don't know but yeah mean shang was not the city let's view the summary what's the total score 5945 so in the middle the the not the best not the worst of my games let me know in the comments below how did you do if you managed to get this map working what were your scores two other videos i think you might find interesting will appear on the right side of your screen huge thanks to all the members for supporting this channel if you would like to become a member yourself click

will be recording a map of abandoned places so abandoned homes ships towns factories planes churches and anything else that the author could find uh i have played this map before it is quite fun it has more than thousand locations so probably we won't get any repeats so uh let's begin let's begin so we'll do one minute per round and not just no moving so we can look around you can play along without geogaser pro just make sure to play before watching this video so i don't spoil at the locations oh we're starting off with official cut with an official coverage here uh this poll um feels turkish and we also see a mosque which also made me think that maybe turkey um so yeah my main guess would be turkey here although you can sometimes see these polls in other countries generally i usually associate with them with turkey because i feel like they are the most common there um where in turkey could we be turkey is a pretty big country so so it's a tough tough choice where to guess but i think i will guess somewhere looking none of this area although it might as well be far far east let's let's make a guess okay not bad it was konya in cornea city so yeah hedging between all of these cities kind of paid off i guess um so that's cool that's cool good start i would say because these locations are pretty tricky usually because there are a lot of unofficial coverage as well okay so okay some some ruins we see a lot of a lot of like a asian asian people i don't know they might be tourists but but but um looking at the people around i would say it's probably somewhere in asia most likely um i don't see any texts so so it's hard to tell um look look there is some text there but it's it's i i cannot read it unintelligible was that the word i or yeah um i don't know if that was the word shall we go taiwan kind of in the middle between japan and other other countries okay it was china okay okay beijing okay okay looking nice looking very nice did wasn't thinking beijing there i felt like beijing is probably more urban than that but okay okay nice nice location ah so the author is wonderbind one wonderbind one you have like a shield graffiti pole like this [Music] i know you get similar poles in estonia oh this oh this looks like a polish pole but yeah you can get these these poles in other countries as well it's just uh it's one of the ways how to tell baltic countries apart is that uh in baltic countries if you see a poll like this it's probably estonia but outside of baltic's uh other countries can can can have those poles sometimes as well this ball looks uh polish to me with those whole holes oh holy poles um let's go kind of like this area maybe ah more south okay went with the wrong area but it was poland so four thousand points again nice oh rudolph core hummel is the author uh keep off caution yeah i would imagine it's it's quite dangerous to climb there oh yeah as as you know i'm not good at beaches guys not good at beaches at all um okay there are some big cruise ships so maybe this is like a like a big cruise cruise cruise destination possibly and this maybe is like one of one old old cruise ship or something i'll go caribbean i really don't know um let's go i don't know dominica this feels quite flat i want to ah i don't have time okay i'm glad i didn't switch it i wanted to switch it somewhere near maldives i'm glad i didn't switch it in time what was this turks and caicos islands what the hell cockburn town okay okay uh let's let's move on decent guess at least i get some points there okay yeah yeah some some inappropriate symbols on the walls by the edgy teenagers and what's the language the alphabet i'm looking if we see some cyrillic letters or are they latin they look latin i don't see any civilic letters at least um i cannot tell what language that is though by by the the text that i'm seeing sirec i hope it's nothing rude i read it out loud um oh [ __ ] somewhere in europe probably i don't know did i guess in time i might have guessed a little bit late okay i did guess in time and it was poland okay like the nature felt like like it's somewhere like like like this part of europe but i wasn't sure which country so i got lucky there with poland well that was the last round of this map 17 400 points 17 400 points that's pretty good i would say for for this map um the chinese location was my worst one um here but but but oh well what can you do all in all i think i did very well uh as always leave it in the comments how did you do let me know did you beat me did you not beat me i am always interested read your comments i read all all of the comments always let's go to the challenges again let's make another one can i do better let's see again if official coverage starting off with the official coverage um these boxes like like bundles on the poles where are they specific okay speed limit so this is america not canada in canada it would say maximum not in europe i feel you don't really see these these bundles so if you sometimes struggle to determine which continent you are in like north america or europe if you see these things on the polls you are probably in in north america i feel like these things are way way more common there yeah i i'll just guess i don't know illinois uh as my viewers my very regular viewers know i am terrible at that uh guessing where in the usa i am it was louisiana of course it was i don't i wasn't thinking that that south i was not thinking that far south so yeah it was louisiana fiba doll fiba doll okay i mean two two and a half thousand points not the worst start a generation for camera pericolo di crollo sounds italian we do have narrow front plates italian front plates um where where in italy could we be also uh this is the abandoned place i was oh i didn't didn't look for the abandoned place in the previous one wasn't looking for the abandoned place in the previous location um so uh yeah this is the abandoned place here where in italy could we be yeah i i i don't know let's guess arreso polonia okay but bologna baloney baloney i don't know how you pronounce it uh but for 600 points okay so another abandoned place what was this okay this is a weird one what it what was this some sort of a machine interesting one not sure speed limit again we are in the usa with some some bollards this feels like southern usa to me i would say like new mexico or something arizona somewhere here maybe just just judging by the surroundings by the vibes you know by the vibes uh let's go arizona it was nevada okay i mean in that area in that general area okay so arizona was a bit closer so good that i guessed it so 3 700 points here okay another official one we have small plates yellow middle lines so we are in uh america's somewhere somewhere in america's the car looks uh to be black do we see the electricity counters properly um not really i was thinking could this be peru could this be peru so yeah this is the abandoned building by the way i might not be paying enough attention to the abandoned buildings that's the whole point of the map i'm just super into into the oh yeah we have stripy poles so this is peru um peru has these poles a lot i'm guessing maybe we're near lima this seems like a pretty large city that we are in maybe not lima itself maybe it's like like one of the it was one of the other ones it was couscou but again 3600 points could be worse right always always gotta focus on the positives could be worse oh this is an interesting one ricardo castell blanco is the author here this is a cool place it's a cool one like a very very old real building like overgrown with trees this looks so cool oh my god this looks so cool there's these like roots wow wow like literally nature taking over uh an old building i have absolutely no idea um where this is though by the way i do apologize if i sound a bit weird i am having a little bit of a running nose so so if i do sound a bit different then that that's the reason okay um i don't know this feels like maybe europe maybe i really don't know i'm guessing somewhere i don't know croatia in basically in the middle of europe i have no idea where this is this might be brazil yeah like my second guess would have been south america i was debating in my mind between europe and south america there joe chose in favor of europe though so only 25 points damn it was like in the middle of amazonian like rainforest manaus nose okay damn yeah very interesting interesting place uh let's do the summary i definitely did worse yeah the last round if i had done good well in the last round i would have beaten my first first game but i didn't 14 613 points this time okay let's give it let's give it a third try what's what's what will be my my score in the third run okay again starting off with the official coverage driving on the opposite side of the road um do you see back plates does it say oh zone okay that makes more sense that makes more sense i read it as edna so i get very confused what the hell is ed um oh so this is the abandoned building right architecture doesn't help me i'm not good with with those things are the black plates yellow i couldn't tell honestly i couldn't tell they might be i think they i think maybe i see a yellow plate there maybe let's go northern ireland to kind of like like in case it is ireland i'm not too far away oh yeah it wasn't [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] should have stuck with me in the yellow plate that i thought i saw um near brighton near eastbourne hastings hellingly okay so we are we're in southern southern um united kingdom okay but again like 3 500 points not too bad okay what is this cam camera 360. that's not helpful the author is cam camera again i guess that that's the author's brand cam camera cam camera [Music] so this is like an abandoned bridge i guess which you don't see abandoned bridges very often yeah it clearly is missing the part i guess they have built like a newer newer bridge right there so this one they are not using anymore that might be the case where is this though this this feels quite tropical i don't know could this be i don't know if there's like a i know there is like a big bridge here in brunei i doubt that it is it maybe there's like an old bridge next to it no okay oh oh oh it's the the florida thingy i know there is like like a big road under florida i guess it still counts as florida but i had never never like been there okay so that was there bach railroad bridge okay i mean it did look like a railroad bridge so and this is the this was the interstate that we saw there very interesting place to have a railroad bridge to be honest but okay okay so didn't didn't get did i wha why is it not showing showing my score does it mean that i get zero points i guess i get zero points okay another another graffitied building hopefully nothing inappropriate this time um okay yeah this this house is falling apart this house is definitely falling apart again i'm getting european vibes i might be completely wrong was our okay we sing some english so maybe this is us or or uk or ireland or australia smash okay now i'm leaning more towards usa with all of these english texts on the walls may look like an old school building or something yeah i'm yeah i'm okay i'm fairly certain this should be like us or canada now let's go missouri kind of in the middle kind of in the middle let's guess it was buffalo buffalo oh very close actually to the city center actually interesting interesting so at least i got the right country i'm happy with that happy with that almost almost 2500 points this is a pretty building by aldis bloombacks oh that's a latvian name so i'm guessing this is a lot for you yeah we see some lefty and looking poles i didn't check the the author's name on the previous location so it might have been something english as well but yeah this is latvia all this bloomberg's is a latvian name and and and the polls also do look i mean everything looks like it could be latvia even without the author's name i would be strongly considering latvia here um where where um [Music] i'm maybe somewhere in this area looking there it says it's somewhere here maybe okay a little bit more south okay so it was what's sienna wednesday in this castle but woodsy in a castle i have never heard of woodsy you know but i mean the castle looked pretty nice abandoned unfortunately i don't know maybe maybe someone has restored it recently who knows who knows about 4 800 points i'm very happy with this guess recognize my own country that's nice uh what is here do not go beyond this point yeah i mean it does look like it might collapse at any point so yeah do not go beyond that point please oh this is official this is an official coverage english yellow middle lines huh oh are there flags is this a malaysian flag wait what are those flags is this it what are those flags malaysian american i mean we had english so america makes sense what is this flag i don't know i'm guessing that might be a state flag i don't know state flags but yeah since we saw english we have yellow lines on the road and and this flag kind of looks american i would go with america [Music] kind of like oklahoma let's go oklahoma i'm not sure at all don't know about those those state flags unfortunately philippines oh oh i guess it wasn't an american flag or was it let's let's have a look at that location again can we get closer to the flag can we get closer it was an american flag so i got debated i got debated we have a philippine the flag of the philippines right next to it but but it we i couldn't tell it was the feel i thought it was a state flag because i only saw red and blue okay let's continue then uh oh that was the last round uh yeah the these two these two rounds screwed me over so to speak only ten thousand eight hundred and eighty eight points really got you painted on that at the philippines round let's do the fourth one last last last game four four times the charm as they say let's let's go for the last one uh slama remy remy goose is the author okay we have a snowy coverage i would definitely say europe looking at the author's name i'm thinking maybe polish with that that the s s z ending maybe i don't know if like czech or slovakian has that ending i'm pretty sure that polish does correct me if i'm wrong in the comments um oh yeah the time is running quickly running out i i think i'll go with poland kind of in the middle middle of the poland of poland okay it was poland it was poland closer to the czech border okay it was a legnita like it's kind of close to where i was this year i was in rotslow and like like down here traveling along the border so i would i have been close close to this place okay another abandoned building pretty big one yeah multiple about oh damn this is like an abandoned town wow by igor rogov some factories nearby are still working okay this is a russian sign i was i was thinking in my mind this this kind of feels russian the author's name also sounds like it could be russian but this sign is russian with this uh white side white like white paul paul i don't know and bought a black bottom um where where where though i have absolutely no idea i mean this is winter so it looks kind of kind of sad and depressing even even if the buildings weren't abandoned let's maybe go kind of kind of meet russia wow it was very north above vorkuta okay wow yeah i mean no one no wonder it is abandoned it's in such a such a remote place such a remote and cold place um yeah yeah um yeah i never really understood why people settle in places like that where it's like the nature is so harsh maybe to to gather some natural resources that's that's the only only reason i can think of okay someone is is is reaching the basketball hoop the author is jay frillard frey lark jay freilark uh looks looks nice looks nice these like like rusty constructions and the style of the houses makes me think like ukraine or or one of the surrounding countries could it be russia again could be like i don't know romania moldova i think i'll go i don't know where which are the mountainous parts of ukraine maybe let's go more more to the west somewhere here ah georgia makes sense georgie is very mountainous yeah yeah if he could have seen some language that would have helped a lot there but but yeah i was thinking like eastern europe or russia somewhere in that area so okay uh next round four fourth round we are driving on the left side dunkin donuts so so so american influence oh that's a big air airplane i have seen this location before i remember this airplane i don't remember where it was my memory isn't that good cctv cannot read what it says 30 seconds remaining uh enjoys virgin islands they do drive on the left side right oh god are there any roundabouts or big intersections they are driving in the left side yeah here okay those arrows someone in the comment section gave me this tip that i didn't know if you zoom in on big roads they show the arrows on which side the they are driving so if you forget which side the country is driving you can zoom in and fight it out that way it wasn't a u.s virgin islands it wasn't uh it was indonesia it was indonesia uh yeah not the best guess but the tip stands the tip is a very very good one i i have used it a couple of times and it's it's a really good tip then it was so a big airplane just lying around in denpasar and the last round let's have a look um another another abandon like like a pretty big building like an office building or something i don't know or maybe a factory probably a factory in a place like this i don't know um seems like there are a bunch of other buildings to our like north east if if we can trust the compass mauro sione is the author orozioni i don't know sounds kind of italian maybe the author's name doesn't mean that this this should be italy but it definitely feels like europe to me i'll definitely see say that this is europe um hmm time is running out quickly ah let's go let's go let's go croatia kind of near italy near near the other other europe so where was this it was italy okay it was just italy she should have trusted the author's name this time so it was again bologna baloney bologna i don't know how to say it but it was italy again a lot of abandoned places there apparently uh but yeah not not too bad of i guess what is my score 13 000 points yeah some of these guesses were not the closest unfortunately but all in all i think i did okay like taking into account what kind of a map this was and then let me know in the comments how did you do i am really interested to do here if you manage

will be playing some more capitals of the world except this time in a different map just to avoid some repeats get some new locations but again these locations are from the world capitals by tino which is a member of the community which is always nice to see community maps let's play it with no moving and time limit will be let's say one minute and it will be the challenge links in the description you don't need a pro account to play just make sure to play it before watching this video okay let's go let's go so what do we have uh this is official coverage okay i have no idea what those little guys are some sort of public service announcement this feels like maybe brazil because we have a pretty red soil as you can see we have a generation four camera the sun is to the north so this is oh these are capitals i totally forgot that these are all capitals um so either buenos aires or brazil right no other options we're driving in the right side this isn't like africa or anything um should be should be should be brasilia i don't think buenos aires would have such red soil or would it i mean these are not argentinian plates are they no no so let's go brasilia yeah it was brasilia noise only lost 12 points well i probably shouldn't have guessed in the middle of a park in the hindsight probably shouldn't have guessed in the middle of a park but but but still okay another official coverage that's cool khal lakala is spanish color is spanish high street i'm getting european vibes so i'm thinking this might be mad madrid possibly can't see any like like license plates or anything but i don't know the architecture just feels very european and yeah just just getting huge european vibes universal it's in might the domains might say might say m.a madrid possibly i think it started it says m.a here which would also confirm that we are in madrid but that's my my looks quite central looks like city center to me possibly so let's let's just plonk it in the middle okay not a bad guess not a bad guess 138 meters away only one point lost nice start okay another official coverage official coverage is easier to me because i know at least some some clues about the countries with official coverage although this one looks tougher this one looks tougher i'm not sure which country this is to be honest oh i don't see the language properly [Music] yeah well oh slow slow so it should be slovenia then i was thinking it looks kind of like austria a little bit so it makes sense that it would be slovenia because it's right right next door right i hope this isn't like like a foreign car just arrived here i can't really read what it says but yeah slovenia oh let's go let's go so only three points lost on this one so doing very well recognizing getting only official coverages currently which is i guess lucky but i know for a fact there are some unofficial coverages in this map as well we have a yellow plate yellow plate no google car visible yellow plate makes me consider loss with a motorbike house is clearly location um driving in the right side [Music] with palm trees i think loss is my best bet here and yeah the capital works because the capital in laos doesn't have the car visible in other lotion cities you can't see the car in the capital you won't see the car so that works because we don't see the car let's see okay okay not not that close this time it was three kilometers away but i'll gladly take it gladly take it okay this is this without looking looking down this should be ghana right yes okay okay and we have some oh these are uh gunney's guineas cars with these like like patches some people have told me these are taxis some people have told me no these are not taxis so i don't know if those are taxis but yeah you see these like cars with like yellow the yellow side patches in ghana um and also of course the tape the tape is also found in ghana um is the capital the road i guess we can spend a little time aligning the road maybe like somewhere here going like this i don't think this is such a large road to either way let's let's go somewhere here because a lot of streets are going in the direction there okay yeah nice 1.9 kilometers away let's do the summary i think this game was amazing for me very good guesses i recognized all of the capitals and you can expect a lot of great scores on this map right but i in total in the whole game i only lost 37 points which is crazy that is crazy so let me know in the comments how are you guys doing in the these these challenges but yeah let's go for another one again link in the description let's go oh here we go another unofficial coverage this time yeah all of those previous ones were official which is interesting get a very very lucky scene okay we have some is this arabic might be arabic the author's name is marwan al tavane okay doesn't help much [Music] i don't know the plates the plates if you if you know the plates these the plates might be super helpful because they look quite unique like blue at the top white at the bottom yeah this is arabic i don't know which arabic country this might be arabic speaking or damask could this be syria iraq iraq let's go syria or iraq okay oh it was egypt wow okay okay okay fair enough at least i didn't switch to iraq i guess because syria damascus is way closer i guess that's good i'll always gotta look for positives another unofficial one drc vista honduras see this is why you always pay attention to the author because sometimes it just literally says honduras it gives away the author in like the country immediately in these unofficial coverages so it's a this is the capital right oh yeah yeah here is the the dark dot so um i mean yeah like we have spanish so that fits with honduras [Music] so the road goes like this i had another game like in the mcdonald's where he was trying to look for mcdonald's i think it was honduras well when the author's name helped a lot as well i'll leave the the game in the info card okay almost the right street almost got the right street only four points lost there okay not bad not bad at all what is this again unofficial oh very blue plate i cannot read any of this unfortunately so that doesn't help okay a yellow plate so blue and yellow plates [Music] i mean looks like arabic again arabic script so [Music] maybe this is like damascus or baghdad i don't know i don't know or or maybe beirut could this be berut maybe let's go damascus i guess it kinda is close to beirut it isn't too far from baghdad oh okay it was yemen wow sana okay yeah it's very difficult i had no clue no clue i just knew it was one of these these like uh countries that use arabic script that's that's about it okay the author is karen brown brown oh i didn't check the the author's name on the previous one right after i say how important it is maybe it said like like yeah yeah man or something courtyard hotel courtyard hotel oh my god this is such a weird photosphere are there any flags maybe maybe in the stadium hasley has haslee crawford stadium uh very english name um [Music] i don't know i'm thinking this might be one of the caribbean oh [ __ ] i'm turning out of town uh i don't know what dominica dominica i don't dominicus means spanish though trinidad tobago okay i mean it was one of these islands so at least i got that part right didn't know which one though i didn't know which one okay next round cd mohamed che guerre is the author doesn't really help what is this script looking very interesting [Music] i don't know i don't know about the script i was thinking maybe pakistan i don't know does the script match pakistan i have no idea of the script match maybe not i know like they use urdu in pakistan right [Music] i don't know afghanistan i don't know about this uh okay let's go islamabad kind of risky guess i guess in a way because it's so far from all the other capitals but oh wow wow i was completely off oh yeah this script lips looks more like it i guess wow okay okay that this this game wasn't as good as the first one unfortunately in total almost just just below 12 000 points just below 12 000 points so okay let's do it again let's do it again third time's the charm no moving one minute invite friends let's go okay again official official coverage again we have an antenna um as they're selling this property 1000 square meters oh wait oh we have rifts in the sky oh that that helps i don't see the license plates but with these rifts it should be either montenegro or albania and this feels more montenegrine to me these roofs i might be wrong i might be completely wrong though but i am going with podgorica here i feel like in albania the roofs in general are more flat than that you usually okay this was a good one very close very close another official one another official um i cannot read what it says at all oh we have the follow car okay this is nigeria then get your pvc your power to vote voting is important true um but yeah this is nigeria the capital is abuja i always think it's lagos but it's not it is a puja um the road might be this one we have turns there though so kind of here maybe i don't know if there is an intersection below beneath below us or not maybe it may i don't know okay it was a different one okay makes sense makes sense but still not too bad another official yeah we're either getting all official or on all unofficial this feels very lithuanian to me can we see some language laboratory the g means like got the uh on these signs so it is lithuanian yeah this g god mitchell so yeah this let's go vilnius a lovely city of avilnius we have some hills to our kinda north west west uh maybe let's go somewhere here i'm not sure where in vilnius there's like a church maybe more central then i know it was fine okay it was fine so lost only five points here next round another official let's go another official one we have one yellow plate a bunch of white plates with an antenna this is confusing me this is confusing me i'll be honest um i really don't know um i'm totally blanking i'm not sure i'm thinking could this be lebanon but does lebanon have coverage like this i don't think so jerusalem let's go jerusalem athens wow wow okay that this one tricked me a lot let's let's have another look yeah there was absolutely no greek those plates were all over the place like one plate was small yellow one was with a blue strip other ones i couldn't see blue strip here i guess there is a blue strip that one has a blue strip this one is completely white small this one was a small white one yeah this one this side looked spanish to me i was so confused on this round i i mean crease makes sense with these random plates greece can have like these small white plates sometimes just didn't cross my mind i was more like thinking like israel or something okay oh well um next round next round what do we have sk on the plate no no blue strip i'm not sure if there's any blue strip there could this be croatia kind of like a fall coverage as well could this be croatia would this be zagreb maybe like outskirts of zagreb maybe because in croatia you don't have those blue strips and this doesn't look like cyrillic well these are not definitely not russian plates uh definitely not ukrainian plates so sk well sk probably stands for like the city or region right i don't know sk which city could be asking skopje ah damn it ah i forgot the north macedonia exists i am sorry my north macedonian viewers i forgot that north macedonia is it makes perfect sense both with the sk and i'm guessing there was no antenna as well i didn't check if we have an antenna in north macedonia you don't get heaven at 10 a.m didn't check that that was my bad yeah yeah north miss macedonia makes perfect sense here oh let's be summary 19 i mean the score the last two rounds kind of kind of weren't as good but but in total the score isn't too bad so so 19600 okay let's do one last game one last game four four times the charm four times the charm so let's go and now we're getting unofficial again now we're getting unofficial courages again so we have black plates it seems the quality is just beyond terrible author is shido 13th black plates with white letters which makes me think that maybe these stripey balls maybe like um malaysia or i would probably say malaysia this is a cool looking house like a blob i don't know if this this like symbol represents something or uh but but i i don't know it doesn't feel like kuala lumpur to me what else could it be maybe it's like brunei maybe let's go let's go brunei actually oh let's go let's go let's go yeah because it felt very similar to malaysia but it just didn't feel like kuala lumpur kuala lumpur has a lot of like high buildings very like super modern everything right so nice i'm very happy with this guess so author is okay doesn't really help okay this script this script is is found in india and bangladesh right in northern india and bangladesh going on the left side of course that fits i would go india probably because with a coverage like this in bangladesh there should be official coverage there is official coverage in dhaka but in new delhi the coverage is i don't know if there is any official coverage maybe there is in like some universities or something but yeah i am inclined to go new delhi here just because of this script that we see on the bus and the fact that we're drawing on the left oh kathmandu [Music] makes sense makes sense they also use the same writing right right right oh well what can you do it did cross my mind for a second but but i thought india would be more likely oh well okay we have some some i guess arabic script again hmm what does it say something market i cannot read what it says at all 30 sings remaining we had very similar plates in what was the oh god we had the very similar plates before which country was it that had similar plates was it egypt or let's go syria maybe or was it was it yemen that had a similar plate i don't remember oh this was kabul okay i was considering maybe going luke muscat or baghdad i was not thinking kabul oh well okay some official coverage again some check this e letter is check if you see this like e letter with this like check mark above it that's check letter so you can only find it in check language also these red signs with like text on the bottom are are our um opponent prague in particular it says bracha one i think so in prague you can see there are like sections the frog is divided in multiple like regions so prague one is here prog five prog four so on these signs you can see like prague and a number so it represents in which region you are so i think it says praha one so we are in somewhere in this like this region so let's let's just plonk it somewhere there okay a little bit more more south but still only four four points lost good guess okay an unofficial one now distributor autoresay looks kind of french authority um sahil elementation which side are we driving on i can't tell what the hell i have no idea which shirt we're driving on okay we are driving on the on the on the right side okay that makes sense if this is like an x french colony makes sense that we are doing the right side instead of left oh spider net dot b i is bi guinea bissau i was thinking either guinea bissau i was i was actually gonna go like either i was considering going caught the war but bi might be oh oh so apparently bi is burundi i thought bi would be guinea bissau like for bi you know be so or benin but yeah okay burundi makes perfect sense that's what i get for not knowing my my um domain name extensions for african countries lost 5 000 points on this one summary basically 13 000 points here not the best one but i'm still very happy about the first game that i played where i got super high score again let me know in the comments below how did you

contains different animals from all around the world all official coverage so we'll see what kind of animals google has captured you can play along as well the links will be in the description you can play it without the pro account just make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil the locations so we will have 1 minute and 30 seconds and we'll be playing with no moving that's the plan uh so let's go what do we have here oh are these like stinking like geese but these are not keys i don't know what what what kind of birds these are um this is interesting as you guys know i'm very bad at islands i am very bad at islands uh of looks a little bit similar to penguins but those are not penguins i don't know what kind of birds these are i know there is like a like a island with a lot of birds on like midway at all i no this is not midway at all there's this bird island in the middle of an ocean called midway at all but this is not it i'm pretty sure um i i don't know where else to guess though i don't know where else to guess this is like an island in the middle of of nowhere is this midway at all where was midway at all i don't even know where midway at all was i can never wake island no but let's let's guess somewhere like oh here is midway at all but it's not midway at all it's way too this is way too mountainous what i guessed was guam i but it turns out it was just new zealand okay i was not thinking new zealand at all i probably should have checked the sun i always forget to check the direction of the sun god damn it let's have a look if that would have helped the sun was to our north yeah it would have definitely helped god damn i always forget to check like it's it's the first thing you should do you would think i i i know it i always forget okay what's the next one the sun let's check the sun sun is to the south good to know we have yellow place where's the animal we should start facing the animal where's oh here are the like like some deers that's cute i totally totally missed them that's cute um where do where are these deers from we have a yellow plate there we have some white plates all white lines this is like thailand with these like um [Music] these houses are kind of like asian looking and with these concrete like block roads i i'm thinking this might be which uh do we see the steering steering wheel we don't really um [Music] okay let's we have like water right to our like north east um [Music] let's get somewhere here kind of in the middle could be like here as well could be could be somewhere here maybe so we're guessing kind of in the middle hedging our bets it was japan was it a low camera yeah it is low cam just very hard to tell usually usually it's like a very clear white blur for low cameras this time it wasn't very obvious so i totally missed that this is low camera if you when you look at this wall you can tell that the car feels kind of low but i totally didn't notice that okay that was a mistake that was a mistake what can you do oh this is a cool bird i don't know what what kind of bird what kind of a bird this is but looks cool looks cool well i can tell this isn't latvia oh could this be midway at all could it be maybe i don't know i think midway atoll is my best bet because i know there are a lot of birds there whereas here is midway atoll there are a lot of birds there uh where's the sun the sun is kind of to our south it seems so it should be most likely in the northern hemisphere sun can be tricky and sometimes light as well so you can't always trust the sun the water is to our kind of south it isn't midway at all it's definitely not midway at all it doesn't align correctly is it like somewhat that's the thing i have no idea where else could it be i have zero clue actually doesn't have official coverage somewhere here i know i know there is some coverage there okay it was what the hell is this place even what okay i why does this place even has coverage oh um okay i i did not know that that place had coverage at all okay fair enough bad round for me again not doing very well in this video please keep country parks clean please do so you have a cute monkey cute monkey we have some chinese symbols uh chinese texts on the trash bins also the house looks quite like with an asian influence asian style architecture so i am thinking hong kong what could this be japan hong kong or japan or taiwan maybe maybe it's taiwan hmm [Music] my first thought was hong kong so i think i'll go with hong kong here but let's let's go hong kong and see oh okay it was hong kong nice pretty pretty close guess as well 2.3 kilometers away let's go let's go is this midway at all there are so many birds here oh there's a turtle as well or tortoise two two of them oh that's cute i think there's a third one in the distance too um could this be now this could be midway at all in my opinion because it is flat there are so many birds and there is like like a larger island i think well if this is midway at all there should be larger island towards our west let's have a look at the midway at all on the map again if we are like i don't think it works i don't think it aligns i don't have a le i'll just guess where's the sun sun is to the north oh god i don't know let's block in the middle of south atlantic ocean okay i guess i ended up guessing midway at all but where the hell was it huh french freak frigate schwalls airport what very near hawaii well i'm glad my guests didn't go through guessing in south atlantic ocean see but sun can lie the sun was to our north this time this time i'm glad if the guests didn't go through so at least i get some points what the hell i i never even knew this island existed you don't even see it you need to zoom in so much to see it what the hell are these locations okay let's do the summary almost 8 000 points yes so bad so bad let's let's go for another one guys so again challenge minute and a half okay we see some some are these bisons are these bisons okay we don't have front plates driving the right side oh we have an antenna where is the sun sun is to the south okay cool i think hmm this antenna is confusing me santana is really confusing me i think this is america usually you don't see antennas in america but i think this is like southern america somewhere getting getting those like these cars one has no front plate i think i was thinking it could just be mexico i'm just getting more american vibes could this be texas or i don't know arizona new mexico or maybe california somewhere here maybe oh look hilly with trees maybe a bit more north not that close to the border okay it was okay it wasn't close to the border at all it was wyoming okay okay yeah where i guess that's definitely not there that's so dry around here i was thinking maybe like here somewhere yeah okay it was it was wyoming fair enough okay bunch of birdies ducks cute ducks is this uk we don't see the plate i think this is uk yeah a very central london i don't recognize what this house is i might have been is this like this is like hyde park or something i i was thinking i might have been here even this feels feels familiar i'm pretty sure this should be london i'm not i don't know if this is hyde park or something else we have some water to our kind of north west the long water that's that's an original name the long water the house no i don't think this is hyde park i don't think this is hyde park which bar could it be maybe here i think this works dock island cottage yes uh we have we have the bridge we have dock island we have a big house nice okay okay okay [Music] so and there are docks obviously so we're right right right next to the bridge here right ah a little bit okay but we still get 5k points yes yes yes okay i thought it would be closer to this oh but i guess this maybe was the bridge that we saw this this green thing okay anyways at least one 5k uh in in this in the video that's nice taking into account how difficult some of these locations are um again like a small island in the middle of nowhere what why does google even cover these islands they call of these tiny tiny islands but they can't uh cover so many countries i know some some countries have like political reasons but i'm sure some of the countries they could easily cover too or like improve their coverage in some of them uh but yeah that's that's a different story look again island in the middle of nowhere the sun is kind of to the south but still very very high in the sky so we could be in either hemisphere easily could be either hemisphere can't see what language it is why is there a truck on this island it's not like you're gonna drive anywhere far absolutely let's go indian ocean this is not cocos islands let's go latte late let's go late late island it was seriously what the the same one oh my god the same stupid-ass island just the other side seriously that island will be in my nightmares from now on okay what is this looks like say look at some sort of a religious building is this like a i don't want to guess wrong so i better not guess but where is this a lot of pigeons a lot of pigeons i was thinking could it could this be turkey maybe thinking could this be turkey i see no language just just the architecture the people like with headscarves getting like like either turkish or like me the middle eastern vibes but since since this is official coverage then turkey is more likely yeah i think i'll go turkey do i go ankara do i go istanbul let's go ankara tunisia okay it was tunis what was that a saituna mosque it was very nice looking mosque oh what wha what where are the animals oh the crabs uh a lot of crabs i've never seen so many crabs in my life oh my god oh my god there are a lot of them i totally didn't see them at first on these glyphs what the hell um is this like a crab island or something i have no clue um i've never seen this coverage in my life looks like a cool place but uh no clue i think i will go in british indian ocean territory nah it's definitely not there definitely not there hmm let's go not hawaii not with midway at all i don't know let's go guam i have no clue what what was this this was the last round so let's see how close we got oh it is christmas island what okay i was not thinking christmas island here damn very nice very nice place with so many crabs there crazy at the end we got 9 500 points which is a slight slight improvement from the first game but still not the best score but some of these zones are so difficult so difficult i'm still very happy with that one 5k that i got okay let's let's do one last game maybe i can get more than 9 000 points on this one maybe maybe not there's some ostriches as the most which is sun is to the north okay um generation two so generation two center the north and ostriches um i don't know in which countries ostriches live um but uh i am are there ostriches in new zealand we have some some land in the distance to our east it could be like somewhere here i i don't know somewhere around here i have no idea if there are all stitches there no i no clue the other option was africa but i don't think so i don't think so i'd rather go new zealand it was africa god damn it god damn it so apparently there are ostriches in africa i still don't know if there are ostriches in new zealand let me know in the comments if there are if you know oh it was cape of good hope lovely new cape point lighthouse could we see it could we see the lighthouse to the hour or kind of south south ooh west i guess there is the lighthouse wouldn't have a guest wouldn't have guessed that one terrible start five points um what what's the animal here oh hello hello this is a big lizard is this komodo dragon is this komodo dragon because if it is i know exactly where komodo dragons live uh komodo dragons live in the komodo island where was here is komodo national park komodo uh yeah so they live here that's the largest lizard of the world in the world that's why i know it so i this looks like a pretty large lizard to me so i'm thinking this might be the komodo dragon and i know there is some coverage in in this island so i don't know where though where on this island but i think jesting just guessing the island itself i think should should give us a pretty good score nice oh almost 5k oh so close so close 499 i will gladly take it though oh the same oh oh we had this oh god my memory oh no my memory where was this some tiny island in the middle of nowhere oh no oh no where where was this god damn it i literally just had it it wasn't that french one it was a different one oh freaking hell um was this the the new zealand one was this the new zealand one where in new zealand there's water to our south wait what was this not the new zealand one i remember we had one location in new zealand i don't remember where that when i was really surprised that it was new zealand i think i'll go there because i don't have a better guess okay let's i won't remember oh it was that one right ah yeah another proof that my memory could could use some improvements that one god damn it oh no oh no okay and okay what is this around number four we have some cute monkeys very cute monkeys and bunch of rocks when i see these these monkeys i usually think like asia i always associate these monkeys with asia like thailand or or indonesia or something yeah not we could read that sign that would be pretty pretty cool but we can't you can't read anything on the trash either sometimes you can get some hints from trash sad to see so much trash around unfortunately but yeah um okay let's go thailand let's go thailand we have like like a river is that a river kind of to the north i don't know uh let's just like kind of here india makes sense makes sense i've never seen that coverage in india before india has very limited coverage gingy fort it was i guess okay and the last round what are the oh there are a bunch of birds or are those bats no those are bats oh damn so many bats okay just just chilling what because why not public toy let's keep left public toilets keep left um [Music] is this australia or new zealand koala lake street casino some mountains some palm trees oh i think this is australia but i don't know where i don't know where um brisbane maybe let's go brisbane let's go brisbane is this brisbane is this even australia i hope it is in new zealand it might have been okay it was australia oh it was very north it was cairns cairns i don't know how you say it it is all the way northern australia well technically queensland of northern territory but yeah oh what was my final score 8373 so in this map i did kind of struggle let me know in the comments how did you do did you beat me quite likely that you did two other videos i think you will enjoy will appear on the right side of your screen huge thanks to all of

a map focusing on different languages and you can play along as well the links will be in the description you can play along even if you don't have geographer pro just go click on the link and and you should be uh ready to go just make sure to play it before watching this video let's set the time limit one minute and 30. no moving and yes the link will be in the description so let's go let's go yeah this map focuses on different languages uh well more well-known languages some some smaller languages too so we'll see dot s i've never seen this domain name before what the hell is that eus so the language centro integrado this looks like interesting with an x these are like are these two different languages or is this the same language i i don't know i'm confused let's have a look at some other other clues maybe that i can see san miguel we have european i was i was thinking spain but this is not a spanish pedestrian crossing i know there is an x in french is doesn't feel like french maybe i don't know doesn't look like french at all but this isn't spain i mean this plate kinda does look like it might be french okay let's go france just because of that x it doesn't look like french to me but i i don't know guys wow um yeah it's i i don't recognize many languages okay it was it was it was spain it was spain on the very border of france what language was it i'm guessing one of those languages was probably spanish god i saw san miguel why did i go with france if i saw san miguel in the hindsight i should have gone with spain on the spanish side of the border oh well but still 3 600 points oh god i totally forgot that i read son miguel read it and forgot it esk was escaraz bisigara um okay one more language zirzako monastegria that looks like greek in the distance this this is french this this little yellow sign on the top of usually is french i'm so confused where the hell is this i am so confused i'm getting italian vibes i'm getting this looks like a spanish sign this looks like greek text and this looks like a french sign i'm all over the place i have no idea which which which one of them all this is the language looks kinda italian to me so i think i will go italy maybe near french border because this this kind of looks like a french sign maybe this is the french side of the border the this this place is very mountainous so that would fit this area so i'm guessing somewhere here it was spain again again like almost the same area i was thinking that that spain looked spanish but the language felt more italian to me ah god damn it this is a tricky map this is a tricky for me at least since i don't speak the languages i i sometimes struggle to tell them apart okay we have some cyrillic here with a blue strip cyrillic with a blue strip immediately like narrows it down my first thought would be bulgaria also these zone signs you see the zone signs in bulgaria a lot but this j letter or this j letter feels more like serbia or something we have no antenna we have no antenna with cyrillic with a j which which countries had a j in their cyrillic it wasn't bulgaria definitely not bulgaria i think serbia would be the best the best guess i think for for me we have a red red white a red blue and white flag here which serbian flag fits let's go belgrade i think belgrade is our best shot here ah okay it was in belgrade but it still was serbia still with serbia it was leskovats leskovats uh i don't know um was there any sign that it is kovats or or i don't know maybe it said somewhere let's go lots i have no idea that's a city in serbia sin salida dead end so i'm guessing that is spanish i would imagine and this is clearly english so my guess and oh that's a big palm tree my guess would be that this might be us near mexico or mexico or near the us border uh the sun is to the south yeah we have a north american style truck um also these rectangular signs you can see a lot in uh america's for sale so because this sign is in english would make me think that probably we are in the u.s near mexico rather than the other way around that's that's kind of my thinking here we have some hills some mountains our north um i'm not very good at like really if i don't know where exactly there are mountains i know there are some mountains here i think right so maybe we are somewhere here what what's the direction of the road i don't think that that's really important this could this road could be anywhere let's go here this road for example and i'm thinking somewhere okay oh even more to the left okay even closer to the to the cities but okay i was in the right area i'm happy with that getting getting the right area at least um a little bit closer but still 47 a hundred points that's a good score oh what do we have here we have some japanese i believe right or is it hmm or is it chinese no i think it's chinese i don't think that is japanese my my bad my bad um i think it is chinese so we have chinese and some english this is official coverage good to know so this this kind of feels like like uh hong kong or or possibly macau oh i would rather say hong kong i don't i don't think macau has coverage like this we have yellow back plates if i remember correctly for my own videos um hong kong did have yellow back plates right and they drive on the left side of the road i can't see i think the steering wheel is on the right side of the car which would indicate that we are driving on the left side which is another indication that we should be in hong kong in my opinion um what is this place natural natural trail beach natural trail and beach is nearby what what beach why beach do i see at any why beaches here anywhere there are a lot of beaches in hong kong as you can imagine um natural trail i'm out of time oh god okay i was completely off was it japanese then because it really looked like chinese the language maybe that was the that that's that script i know japan uses like different different writing systems right i i haven't really studied that too much so it was all the way here damn i was really really convinced that it was hong kong but it turned out it was what island is this uh ha ha ha okay so it was it was japan i guess oh yeah this this was the worst round of of this game i believe how did we do or how did i do yeah the the last one the last round was the worst but all in all 16 000 points kind of average i'm all in all i'm pretty pretty happy like uh these first two rounds also really confused me but i feel like i kind of kind of came back with the third and fourth round at least so let's let's try it again let's try it again hopefully i can do better this time again link in the description so what do we have uh do not touch oh [Music] okay what are the bollards bollards would be super helpful they're so far away [Music] what they kinda look like like those um czech or slovakian bollards really hard to tell if they are actually those this language looks more hungarian i know you can't see some hungarian in like the neighboring countries i know there is some hungarian in serbia i know there is some hungarian in romania i could easily see some romanian being in slovakia too um so with those bollards and this language which looks kinda romanian with all of uh sorry hungarian with all of these accents i would go hungary uh sorry near hungary in slovakia uh dunatorcas there is no point of trying to find it right i can quickly glance glance over but i i highly doubt that i will find um that yeah i don't see it so the time is also up oh but we were pretty close yeah my reasoning was was uh pretty much right we're just much closer to bratislava i didn't i didn't think we would be that close uh so almost 47 a hundred points good start um okay we have a car visible which is if you know car meta is always a good sign um this is a lao lo lotion lotion car you can find it in laos basically is what i'm saying and with this this language too um in laos only a couple of cities are covered the nta vientiane is is the capital but in the capital you won't be able to see this car so this is definitely not the capital we have like a lake big lake to our south um so which which of the other cities have a lake or is this a river maybe like somewhere here what were the other cities covered like i know this city was covered um maybe i guess this is a big river instead of a lake there is a river here but i don't know i don't know um [Music] it's either either luang prabang or it is savanket this looks like a very big um very big river so i would rather go here i'm not sure if it aligns correctly oh it was it was even more to this oh box yeah i totally forgot that foxy has coverage totally forget i'm not sure if i even if i knew it before i haven't had laos in a while so uh pardon my my uh lack of knowledge so okay it was boxy which lost a couple of hundred points but still 40 four hundred points almost pretty good uh this first sign gives me the area i was thinking romania at first but looking at the bollard i'm thinking it's more like serbia what's with the language um [Music] czechovapenzionera yeah i don't know which which country it is by the language itself but we can have a look around we have no antenna no antenna with these bollards these bollards you can see in a couple of countries but from my experience i usually see them in serbia these this kind of asymmetrical bollards [Music] having no antenna having a blue strip on the car as well it all seems serbian to me okay let's let's go serbia i don't think i have a anything else to to analyze here i mean i i know we should i should pay attention to the language much more but i just don't know i just don't know where uh where they use this let's go is it mountainous a little bit let's go then a bit more south like generally south southern southern serbia is more mountainous oh this was a close one 12 kilometers this was a good guess wow damn let's go yeah generally like more the the more south in serbia you go the more mountainous you get generally um okay next year is it is it the italian is it oh god santa san pantalon um panini mojito mojito whisky cola hello hello pas pastizaria i i know this feels so italian to me this was super italian to me i was in venice and these houses look very like i'm getting like big venice vibes here is this actually venice i i did release a geocaching video from venice like very recently um i'll leave it in the info card up there this looks so much like venice and they had these numbers as well i think this actually might be venice it does look super venetian three thousand where was three thousand i don't remember i remember seeing three thousands was it like somewhere up here maybe i don't i don't remember i might be wrong though do they don't show the numbers do they yeah on the map yeah i think this looks super venetian like the architecture these numbers the language everything it was venice the going to venice a couple of like like a month or two ago helped and went with the wrong part but still uh only lost three points nice yeah it looked super super familiar okay and the last round of this this this game rue rue would indicate france right we have double blue on france the uh friends they do have the double blue as well but uh the right the the right hand side blue will be generally a little bit more lighter um than the left one yeah i'm i think this should be france yeah south south is in french as well and the front plates are not italian in italy the front plates are narrow italy can also have a double blue but the plates will the front plates will be narrow um so yeah this is france uh can we see the phone number i think it's a zero six which doesn't help zero six doesn't help um you can use french numbers to determine the the region of france sometimes but zero zero six is of no help we have some trump tram tracks here so it's probably a decently said city let's go leon maybe i don't know if leon has tram tracks but but let's go leon if a city has tram it generally is like a decently sized city for it to have tram tracks i don't think this is paris this doesn't feel like paris to me it was strasbourg okay fair enough it was it was france just uh not not not the place in france that i guessed uh but i think in this game i did way better than in the first one let's have a look 20 almost 23 000 points this is more like it the last round again was my weakest one but the way way better than in the first first game okay third time's the charm let's play it for the third time again link in the description hank ko hanko okay so two different languages i imagine i'm thinking this this feels very nordic this house feels very nordic and from the language i was thinking that it might be like finnish and swedish i was thinking that this is finnish this is swedish probably generation two camera lots of like birch trees i see um i i'm thinking this might be like finland near sweden the swedish border possibly maybe somewhere up here oh we have like like is this like a river or two lakes or [Music] maybe somewhere here maybe this river what's the direction of the road definitely definitely not there i don't see anything that aligns correctly at least not on this river let's go somewhere here might be completely wrong though might be completely wrong but but this is my guess so let's let's have a look ah was it finnish in estonian or is it actually swedish i know in like helsinki you can see signs in two languages so it wouldn't surprise me that you can see signs in two languages elsewhere as well like finnish and swedish i have seen them are all around finland but for some reason i thought it would be closer to the border okay it was here okay i guess it was probably swedish okay next uh average start uh call zod calzada romana okay this is spain right the language like this phone to this this language felt very spanish to me and this sign also looks very spanish with like no white borders just just this sign so i would i would definitely go spain here puerto santa clara puerto mean sport right so there's like a second language as well sandero like some probably like like a very small language possibly i don't know or is it like uh catalan language maybe i i don't know i don't know let's go let's go near barcelona i have it was not oh it was very near or portugal what what was there like a sign to a port did it not mean port or or what huh i'm confused why did that sign said support or did it not was it not bored okay another average score almost three thousand well definitely could be worse definitely could be worse what do we have okay we have some hebrew hebrew is usually very easy to tell apart we have we do have some yellow plates so yeah this is uh israel [Music] pretty green i don't see any palm trees though um okay so in israel generally like the northern part of israel is more green the southern part is quite dry uh since i don't see like any palm trees at all i'm leaning more towards like further away from the the sea because generally generally closer to the sea you can see more palm trees right so i'm thinking maybe like here somewhere in this area there's like a roundabout in in a city city with a roundabout city with any roundabouts in this city there is a roundabout here let's get somewhere here i don't know ah it was i guess this is like a disputed territory because of these these like dashes okay fair enough fair enough but still 4 800 points pretty close my reasoning was pretty correct pretty sound i would say uh fourth round okay so uh velka okrugna is um what is this what is this uh i don't know um i was thinking like czechia or slovakia this like i'm leaning more towards cheki is this generation four i think this might be generation four maybe i'm not sure i sometimes struggle with them i think this is checky why do they have a why in check language yasikova skullah look like a language school right yes look his language in russian at least um yeah like czechia would be my best guess somewhere like here or ostrava let's go ostrava kinda yeah these it was slovakia okay so yeah i was couldn't tell at least luckily lucky to us it was close to czech czech border and we guessed close to lockheed border so um 4 700 points again so pretty good oh what is this what is this language this is norway but what the hell is this language uh huh we have no we have generation four camera here we have the long lines these long yellow lines in the middle you will see in norway basically the only country i think with such long lines in other countries they will be shorter oh okay we're in norway i have no idea where in norway they they have like they speak this very interesting indeed e45 okay i just noticed we have e45 have to be see e4 e5 anywhere let's make it bigger e45 do we have time e6 i don't think we have time 41 36 i don't know let's get somewhere here kind of in the middle e39 okay let's have a look where was it guessing oh wow wow okay oh my god oh that there is e45 oh if i if i had looked looked further didn't feel that north to me but i was wrong if i had looked further north i would have seen e45 indeed it was kautokeno oh now here is that avg as well that that place on the sign is off damn yeah well got the country right but it was very far away let me know in the comments below how did you do in this challenge and two other videos i think you will enjoy will appear on the right side of your screen a

one with official coverage and one with unofficial coverage in this video i will be playing the maps he created for me and on his channel you can check out how he plays the maps that i created for him in each of the rounds zigzag will give me a short clue about the place that i am in and also i have three lifelines i can use i can ask what continent it is i can ask which hemisphere it is or i can verify if that's the country that i am thinking of so let's go okay so let's begin let's begin oh my god okay oh no i'm so bad at islands this looks like an island i uh the clue for this round is that uh this um in the subdivision of this country this is the most southern point of that specific subdivision state or problems oh okay most southern right okay oh this number on the house i don't know reminds me of north america i'm not sure um i'm thinking maybe canada but i can't read what it says ah this is a tricky one i picked them to be tricky yeah that's the whole point mine will be tricky as well so you you will see also what the hell is this thingy well i don't want to waste my my power-ups just just yet so i am thinking maybe canada so the southern point of the subdivision so i i think the subdivisions maybe provinces possibly uh which province though yeah that's what i'm referring to provinces or states well this looks pretty flat i don't know if this is official or not this looks official looking at the blur it looks like it could be like generation two camera so we have water to our south west it seems south west southern point of the province ontario's southern point would be like probably belly island could this be like pele island but i see no land in the distance though so this is not pele island could it be somewhere here like a mufon land maybe southern point of newfoundland somewhere here there are no roads though down here this is frustrating i don't know which i have no idea which one but okay let's go let's go with this one let's go allen's island for example i don't but that's not this is southern fine let's go back shore oh my god okay what the hell i should have checked the sun i didn't check the sun god damn it wow [Music] game sent francis oh my god that's a terrible start i like your logic but uh that's a terrible story though so the prompt for this one is that uh you're on an island that is smaller than newfoundland that's actually kind of a coincidence that you guessed newfoundland last time but yeah you're on an island somewhere in the world that's smaller than newfoundland oh yeah well that's the islands yeah okay hmm oh yeah this i mean this is is official um we have white lines all white lines so where is the sun you gotta check the sun sun is kinda to the south sun is to the south hmm kind of hilly looking sun to the south smaller than newfoundland i am thinking could this be like one of the canary islands can we see i can't tell if those like reflectors are yellow or not they might be yellow and if they are yellow [Music] okay i think i will use one of my lifelines and i will ask you is is this wait which one should i use um so you've got the hemisphere you've got the uh continent and you've got the um the uh oscar for if the country is correct [Music] okay i will ask if this is spain uh this is not in spain oh okay so these are not canary islands it's not canary islands i i totally uh agreed with your like reasoning and everything but no it's not canary islands damn that was my best guess what the hell is this then i was thinking that this might be chile maybe all white lions chile can look quite similar to spain and if you have designed for this to be tricky i guess this this counts as an island right it does it does and is this is kind of similar to size i think it is smaller yeah the newfoundland so maybe i mean but the sun is to the south i mean sun is kind of in the middle though it's with these clouds is very tricky to know i i think the sun i have to trust the sun now it's not chill i have to trust the sun here what the hell is it then okay all white lines no car visible no antenna if it's not spain could it be portugal azores where was the water water was to our west okay i think i'll go azores because i mean they are pretty like also hilly as well let's go somewhere up here maybe i i don't have a better guess so let's go ah sardinia okay well i'm glad i'm glad i trusted the sun at least yeah true true that was a good play much better points than had you gone chilly that's true that one was really interesting because i was surprised when i found such red soil over in sardinia yeah definitely there itself made me think that it might be like uh one of these these islands maybe i think they have a bit red more reddish soil yeah yeah yeah for sure i kind of thought that's where in the world you'd probably go um you you knew perfectly well the uh prompt for this one is that this city has a year-long average temperature of minus 8.8 degrees so that's a year-long average temperature temperature okay wow okay so oh this looks very russian very rough and with this long antenna with this yellow pipe uh also with these like blue blue colored uh windows you see this blue color a lot in uh like not only only russia but like eastern european countries as well um blue roofs and if the year-long temperature average temperature is negative well it must be pretty pretty northern more monsk could it be somewhere here like the thing with russia is that like this part doesn't have much coverage at all yeah that's true so if we are very northern it is more likely to be somewhere here in the western part so i'll give you a further clue which is basically what i've already said but um this is i believe uh the coldest city in the world oh oh interesting i think as far as i know if only i knew which what was the which was the call the city of the world that would be very helpful right now why is this person rocking around with a t-shirt what the hell the coldest city in the world i think it still gets up to 15 degrees night of summer so they're probably i guess during the summer i guess so yeah well well there is no snow i don't know but the coldest city of the world i was thinking like svalbard probably is colder than this but i mean this is rush i think uh sombra doesn't have any cities though uh like i think it's it's not talking about towns it's talking about proper cities doesn't isn't this like longier i don't know i don't know i guess with the definition of steady being more than like 30 000 people or something like that because even even newark doesn't have uh more than like 20 000 i don't think so yeah well this definitely isn't more mansk itself it looks smaller but i'm thinking maybe it's somewhere nearby this is kind of like risking it a lot but i feel like i have to risk it yeah okay so i will ask about the continent then is this this is in asia is in asia okay okay that's very useful knowledge then mm-hmm and then it's oh god i don't know which of these cities have even coverage here oh i will just give you a final hint i'll give you a final hit this uh this i believe this uh city has more than a hundred thousand people in it a hundred thousand people i believe so hmm so usually pretty big city as well any big cities up here well from the coverage it certainly doesn't look like a city with hundred thousand people i would have never thought it's that big yeah um so yeah it has it has almost three hundred thousand people yeah wow okay let's go i don't know let's go yaku it's kind of kind of for hedging purposes as well if it's more to the east or to the west i'm kind of kind of here kind of kind of central yeah let's go wow it was yakuza wow i mean i couldn't have done it without your hands to be honest no no no i think i think that's a good one because it's so interesting that that is actually the coldest city in the world i would have never thought yeah wow i i couldn't live there that's for sure yeah well latvian winters is already are already too much for me already enough doesn't even really go below zero where i live i wouldn't i wouldn't deal with that okay so the clue for this round is that uh the um the vegetation is not typical of the country hmm so let's have a look where the sun is the sun is to the north so that could be helpful sun is to the north and generation 2 which also helps because in southern hemisphere there really aren't too many countries with generation two camera southern hemisphere well i don't think this is south africa doesn't feel like south africa at all what else do we have we have some brazil australia some new zealand as well i think with the gen 2 and that's it i was thinking could this be like australia or new zealand i was thinking somewhere around there maybe i'm thinking possibly new zealand because i know new zealand can sort of look similar to baltics in a way and this feels a little bit similar it does have a boat with this road yeah yeah i have had some locations where new zealand feels eerily similar to baltics um except that sun is to the north so with gen 2 and potentially it could be australia but i mean i i have to guess one of one or the other there's no point guessing in the middle in the sea i have i have seen some people guess in the middle to get point a little bit more points i feel like it's worth risking because if you guess in the sea you lose a lot of points either way yeah they're deceptively far apart it is pretty hilly i don't see any like high mountains though so i will still go with northern ireland i think i go with i'll go with southern part of northern new zealand let's see ah it was australia ah chose the wrong one in my state of south australia that is an infamous uh an infamous region in my community just because of how strange it looks there's lots of pine plantations over there near my gambia yeah it definitely doesn't look like your typical australia yeah at least i'm glad i got the like correct region of the world at least yeah yeah that was good that's good okay okay and let's go for the last round well i might as well yeah i might as well ask which hemisphere is this so this is southern hemisphere and also to the prompt for the round is that to the south you can see the pacific ocean oh okay we can see pacific ocean to the south well my first thought when i saw this was uh like south america so and if we can see pacific ocean so it's not brazil good to know because i was considering brazil but with these little houses could it be indonesia with the yellow line though oh god which set are we driving on oh no oh no the first thought was does it count i think it counts as indian ocean though yeah okay so it's not it shouldn't be indonesia since it's an indian ocean there okay so let's return our thought process to south america then these houses felt very asian to me but yeah the pacific ocean wouldn't work with asia then would it be peru i don't think it would be chiller with the yellow lines so central yellow lines if you have no antenna ecuador these these uh arrows were reminding me of ecuador but could it be one of the ecuadorian islands though oh are you tricky and take going with some islands would it be here maybe could it be does it align i don't know if there is even kind of coverage here to be honest i'm just looking at the roads and trying to align them or is this just the mainland ecuador or is this not even an ecuador what is this i don't even know if this place is it has coverage but i think this would be a place that you might choose just to be tricky just to be tricky there are comments field in their comments no comments yeah yeah this is such a risky guess though oh my god such a risky guess but i mean there is a pacific ocean to our south as well so i think i'll have to i i will risk it i have to risk it i feel let's let's go all right oh no oh no oh no it was mainland ecuador ah god damn it you weren't as tricky as that sweating i was absolutely talking because uh when i realized that this was the last round and uh you're gonna ask for which uh hemisphere it's in uh actually forgot because it's right on the equator oh it is right on the equator wow oh my god i thought you would be trickier than that ah yeah what was my final score though six thousand eight hundred points yeah yeah that's that's not a bad score especially the best score you could guess was good so your uh your three hints uh will will be back again okay uh power-ups okay perfect perfect let's get it let's go so unofficial no moving the clue is that this island has a population of 32 in the summer and 16 in the winter 32 in the summer and 16 in the winter wow approximately of course [Music] this is tricky i was watching like a documentary a while ago about some some canadian fishing town that also has like super small population but this is probably not it we have some pretty high mountains here yeah that's going to help for sure yeah well it definitely helps a little bit helps to eliminate a few places but because i imagine many of those canadian fishing towns wouldn't have such big mountains in the background if they're in the hudson bay or something um that is true i mean i'm not even sure if this is actually canada though this might be it might be like greenland norway of course you have your three power-ups as well so yeah noise oh this might be the type of ram where you want to go for one looking for there's absolutely no text no nothing you've chosen a good location architecture architectural geography i'm not very good with architecture though that that's that's my my downfall okay i am i don't think these houses look very very nordic i think like in norway the houses would look different i am leaning canada with this mountain remember this is an island well this is an island oh i mean yeah there are some there's 32 in this oh okay yeah thank you i miss missed that part yeah um i am thinking that i'm i am thinking that this might be one of these islands like on the western part of british columbia maybe oh no idea which one with such a small population maybe it's like finn island there are absolutely no no towns though marked there i think a lot of these bc islands are uninhabited yeah it looks like that looks like they are not i mean maybe it's like us as well maybe it's like one of these towns doesn't have to be canada could be us alaska somewhere in this area that's my best guess somewhere in this area so let's let's see wow wow what the hell oh my god two points nice wow amazing start very similar to the previous map i was hoping you'd use the um the uh maybe the hemisphere clue or something this hemisphere i was considering yeah i was considering it i decided to save it for later maybe i should show oh my god my batman's out there i like that mindset all right next round oh okay sorry for this one the clue for this one is that uh on the beauty parlor you have a clue into this country's colonial history the beauty parlor goody parlor so beauty parlor what is this beauty what are your shops is cathedral stationery oh beauty parlor here we go yeah gianni uh gianni sounds italian i don't know which country is it italy colonized this is an interesting looking language i have no idea where they s right right like this oh no um which okay we're drawing the right side some red redness is that an israeli flag that person is carrying this language is like throwing me off it's a super easy looking alphabet huh i am thinking could this be like don or somewhere there but no their their script looks different sudanese script ethiopian script is super interesting i guess it is ethiopian actually i think one of these letters matches this one this weird one i see it here oh yeah okay nice so i guess i knew ethiopian language looks weird but yeah i didn't realize that i thought it looked different oh i guess let's go out this abba maybe let's go oh it was eritrea um i mean pretty close though i i'm still happy with my guess to be honest i didn't know why you used that alphabet as well yeah they have a difference they have a different alphabet on them at some point yeah i was i was wondering yeah about the the colonial history because i think ethiopia wasn't colonized right yeah yeah i think it's one of the few countries yeah yeah that's uh that's why i was wondering like what what's the connection there yeah but okay this is interesting the cliff this one is that this radio telescope was constructed in 1974 by the ukrainian navy but this location is not in ukraine interesting this is hmm absolutely massive this is massive i think we have a big big like dish like this in latvia as well but i've never been there i don't know how it looks i'm wondering could this actually be latvia or maybe not it's definitely like looking at the the uh flora looking at the surroundings this might be some well since it's constructed by europeans it um probably is in europe constructed by ukrainians um well by the way you still have three power-ups left so you can actually three power-ups use yeah you can actually use um one of them that's around guaranteed yeah so well the hemisphere i'm pretty sure i know the hemisphere uh continent i'm pretty sure i know the continent i am wondering wait i think i see this uh bollard this is a latvian bollard it is a latvian pollard um so yeah this is like i don't know where that telescope like the radio satellite is though lpg i was thinking uh that it means like latvia's propanagas or something so um i don't know where it is though that's the thing this looks kind of coastal probably with these like like dunes sure yeah yeah maybe it's all the way here on this coast i feel like if it was closer to riga i would have probably visited at some point since i'm from riga myself maybe it's like close to leopard that's a relatively big city artillery battery number one there are some some army things here maybe it's somewhere around here can i tell you something sure you have you have indeed figured out the country and i was literally going to choose a uh location at artillery battery number one and then chose not to chose not to use it that's an insane coincidence actually damn that's crazy yeah i i i don't know where this unfolds i i have heard of this place just just for hedging let's go somewhere maybe more like here closer to riga okay let's go kind of here let's do it okay it was okay i don't know ah here we go okay yeah you really need to zoom in for it to show up yeah yeah okay yeah that's what i have in there okay i'm very happy with this piece together the evidence there that was good that was good yeah i'm glad i recognized the bollard indeed that was impressive i had no idea that i was even in the photosphere okay so now the clue for this one yeah yeah the clue for this one is that uh this country uses orange license plates yeah we that is i don't know which countries use orange license plates unfortunately not not only the official coverage can i find some writing maybe see fortunately you still have all your hints left yeah that is true on this round two i probably will use at least one of them on this round i'll let you i'll let you use uh two on a single round if you if you so desire because you've been frugal with them so far um okay i think i will ask the continent this one is in africa africa okay yeah i wasn't sure i was thinking these houses feel a little bit asian so i was wasn't sure if it's africa or not yeah okay so we are in africa yay okay and i will ask also which hemisphere this is this is in the northern hemisphere northern hemisphere okay so that kind of kind of helps a lot knowing that we're in northern africa like the equatorial line divides it very neatly in half orange plates i don't know about that and i don't know which side we are driving either unfortunately yeah it's just obscured by the sun [Music] that's unfortunate the steering wheel yeah i don't know if the windshield wipers are the other direction if you're driving if the steer is on the right side yeah i've no idea i've never thought about that i'm just thinking though the only the only um countries in africa in the northern hemisphere that drive left are kenya and uganda anyway and neither of them is also a good point yeah also a good point yeah yeah i guess like it would make sense that windshield wipers would be the other direction if the steering wheel is on the other side uh i don't know i'm feeling cameroon is calling my name i don't know why i'm not sure if cameroon has orange plates or not but i feel like cameroon is calling my name let's go with cameroon let's go oh my god wow even though it's out of town let's go that's crazy oh my god one kill 1.3 kilometers away wow you're literally walking distance right there damn that's crazy yeah so that is that is uh uh the country that uses orange number plates for all their cars so they go damn did not know that okay so what is this this is this the prop for this one is that this is the country's parliament house house okay i feel like i have seen this coverage before but i don't remember my memory is terrible but i feel like i've seen it before that's annoying fortunately you get to guess the country and find out yeah you're right or wrong before you guess [Music] i feel like this might be somewhere in the caribbean i have a feeling it might have been in caribbean okay let's ask okay i'll ask is it guadalupe it is not guadalupe not quite alone i'll be honest i don't know which which can't which of these countries drive on which side so that that doesn't help me we could just look for um for uh like uh english names to find out the british ones i guess but there's also american ones in there as well so it doesn't really help me yeah exactly uh okay i'll give a further i'll give a quick uh this parliament house is like somewhat of a replica of the white house actually it does look similar definitely the the like the top it's the top side modeled after my house and this country has a significant american um would you say influence bahamas maybe the bahamas possibly i think i'll go with bahamas i don't have a better guess than that and bahamas definitely have american influence so do we have like parliament house somewhere well anyways i i'm not even sure if it is bahamas let's just plonk it in nassau the torch takes so long you wouldn't have guessed there yeah i only gained independence from the us like 50 years ago i think but um yeah they uh they have they have their own white house despite only having 20 000 people yeah that's that's crazy i really thought it looked very caribbean to me personally well 13 000 points that's pretty good in my in my book i'm very happy with this that was a fantastic round that was a fantastic round especially after the first guess i thought oh but uh no you pulled it back that was right yeah the first one was bad i i kind of thought you'd get that lapian one i was like ah he's he's probably gonna know this but i'm just gonna put it in there anyways thanks for making these maps they were really really interesting and i enjoyed them playing me on paper if you enjoyed this video i'm sure you will enjoy zigzags video where he plays the maps that i created for him it will be in the description below two other videos i think you might enjoy will appear on the right side of your screen huge thanks to all the members for supporting this channel and if you

by mr beast and mark rober to raise 30 million dollars to remove 30 million pounds of trash and plastic from the oceans rivers and beaches all the money earned from this video will be donated to team seas and every dollar donated guarantees a removal of one pound of trash the money is split evenly between ocean conservancy and the ocean cleanup which both are amazing charities that clean up oceans and beaches if you want to support the cause you can head onto teamsies.org to make a donation there or you can help by going out picking up some trash buying less plastic packaging and sharing this video to spread awareness as per theme of the video i will be playing a few water related maps and you guys can play along the links will be in the description just make sure to uh play these maps before watching this video so i don't spoil the locations okay so the first one this is an official coverage uh the map is called islands of the world so could be greenland as well britain is an island looking at this i'm thinking could this be greenland um not sure really the sun the sun isn't usually helpful in these like uh very north or very south locations um hmm i'm thinking currently i'm thinking greenland or maybe canada northern canada as well maybe possibly let's go somewhere here maybe kind of both close green and then coast close to the rest of canada somewhere okay it was it was even more northern canada so it was northern canada what is even with quit park national park okay very northern i didn't i didn't even know that this far in the north they have official coverage so learning something new today again official coverage this might this map might only have official coverages i'm not sure uh we have some japanese here oh and we have the shape of the island if i could read the the japanese text then it would be even better but can we find the shape of this island no that's not it in the time that we have oh no oh no oh japan has so many islands though oh god damn it this one this one kind of fits i think this yes yes this is it this little thingy at the bottom right yes this is the island where are we it does this red thing marks where we are possibly where is the sea the sea is to our kind of west north yeah this fits hey let's go 5 000 points oh this was a good one this is good i'm very happy i've managed to find this uh like island the shape the shape really helped it helped me there i'm not usually very good at islands guys so don't expect a good result of me in these maps because i'm really bad at islands the last round wasn't it was an exception okay we have a canadian flag that's good that's good so at least we know the country even though the country is pretty big uh we have water to our south we have watered our south there don't appear to be like high mountains or anything so i'm thinking we might be somewhere like like like somewhere in the eastern side i think maybe can we see like we can see some land in the distance we can't see some sign this is some sort of land i don't know this is definitely not that place exactly but i think it's somewhere here ah okay a little bit more west west of this but still i i'll gladly take it it was grues isle garu soil gru's isle and the irish memorial okay the next one okay we have a oh we have a dog oh that's cute that is cute we have a grey car we have these uh like concrete roads these concrete roads and the grey car both make me think the this is the philippines um we have water to our south well in the philippines there are so many islands water to our south doesn't necessarily help there are some small smaller islands i mean that's not it that is not it but we're just basically we're just basically guessing somewhere um somewhere kind of in this middle of the philippines hoping that won't be we won't be too far oh my god that actually was that island oh my god i didn't even think actually that it would be wow okay okay i'll i'll take it i'm getting so lucky here oh god this is the us now oh where though let's keep in mind that these are islands so this isn't mainland us we have no antenna no antenna on the google car i really don't know where this could be i don't think this is hawaii this doesn't feel like hawaii at all the trees don't match up so we have like looks this looks like a lake this might be like a lakeside this may be an island in the middle of a lake or something could be one of the great lakes somewhere near that's canada though i mean this i guess this oh no this is usps so this is not kind of oh i don't know guys let's get somewhere near washington maybe it's one of the like kent island maybe i don't know oh it was here ah gru's isle wait what wasn't what was the the canadian one called wasn't it also called like groove soil or something i don't remember where it was yeah agro oh it was gross aisle it was gross isle and this is oh also gross aisle okay not sure what it means but there are i guess this is the second gross aisle this time in the us though okay i was thinking maybe somewhere near the great lakes but i didn't see any like islands in the u.s that would match i saw some islands in canada here but yeah overlooked this one what was the summary 19 000 points for an island map i would say it's amazing score for me at least the the first round was the wor the worst but i think i did pretty well in that one two so the great game breakdown here we go so the next map we'll be playing is a water world hand selected location and spherical photos from rivers seas lakes etc so again challenge now moving one minute and let's go oh god this is official coverage but oh god this is literally in the middle of a river at least we don't see any trash in the river that's always nice to see trash free rivers um [Music] i don't even know which part of the world this could be well since this is official we can trust the sun the sun is to the south sun is to the south so this probably isn't brazil i was considering brazil could this be like the us or canada somewhere okay it's not there it's not that mountainous but i don't know where else maybe somewhere near again the great lakes somewhere near the great lakes maybe that i have no clue that's my best guess okay not not too bad i was expecting worse i was expecting worse it was in the us the random river was what is that it's mississippi okay mississippi river yeah had no clue but uh pretty good for the first round for for my standards i'll take it again this feels like like i'm getting kind of grand canyon rhymes but i don't think there are like water like river is like this in grand canyon though like like the rocks remind me of like kind of like grand canyon vibes uh so again official coverage good the sun to the north this time wow okay that that's confusing why is the sun to the north if the sun is to the north it indicates that we should be in the southern hemisphere most likely um which makes me really confused i wanted to guess like us or something but um see no flags i i honestly no clue where to guess let's guess i don't know bolivia it was the u.s oh my god seriously the sun tricked me sometimes it happens sometimes the sun does trick us uh god damn it it was actually where i was initially thinking ah god damn it oh it didn't get lucky this time what do we have next again like a a boat in in the middle of a big river the flags are too far can't see the flags anything useful on the on the shirt no yeah this again sun whereas the sun the sun is a little bit south but it's it's very high up in the sky so it could be could be either hemisphere they get is this the us again god oh the time is very rapidly ticking okay let's go to the u.s again maybe the map maker only included the us locations here i have no idea let's go mississippi uh river again ah poland okay i was not thinking paul like i was getting a little european vibes from the cars the cars looked kind of european on the on the coast like the river i had everything else felt american to me okay so this was what is this river vistula river okay nine points great great score great score forecast okay this is unofficial coverage we can see the author samir hansen hansen sounds kind of nordic a little bit to me hansen so maybe this could be somewhere near like like norway or something i don't recognize the skyline no clue yeah i don't know what's this this globe looks pretty unique but i don't know where it is um from i am thinking kind of maybe like somewhere near near norway stockholm denmark somewhere here let's go maybe oh wow okay okay completely off it was los angeles wow okay um yeah i did so good at the fir in the first map and this one oh my dear lord okay what are these paddles okay in the middle again literally nowhere absolutely not close in the first map at least you could like tell some some clues from the roads and and and other other like signs and stuff but here literally you're in the middle of a river i'm guessing this is the river or maybe a huge lake from the sun and to the south which continent are we we could be anywhere let's go to europe i'm kind of feeling europe here a big lake in europe or a big river let's go big river let's go danumba mir brought this lava maybe let's see okay again got the wrong continent oh god okay yeah my performance in this map was just horrific i couldn't get the continent right most of the time in total 2018 almost 2021 would have been pretty epic to get the year uh year right oh my god i got i got the continent right once once the first round was the was was my best one okay um yeah that wasn't wasn't the best wasn't the best but let's go to the third one which will probably be even worse and the third map will be an underwater world and as you can see the average score here is 2 900 points which will be rough this map all the locations in this map are underwater as the title suggests so um wish me luck the locations are very beautiful as you can see amazing like fishies but i have no idea in like which part of the world these fishes live no clue no clue at all i am thinking maybe like near caribbean maybe but that's just a pure guess uh i'm just basically admiring the view admiring how beautiful this location looks trash free so let's keep the oceans oceans trash free guys and let's support team c's i think i'll go near guadalupe just just a random guess in caribbean hoping for the best uh it was australian coast it was the great barrier barrier reef i guess riff riff rip but i i have seen some other reefs near there like here near brazil didn't recognize that it was the great barrier reef unfortunately let's go for the next round [Music] okay a lot of very very oh wait there is something here excel cut catlin seaview survey okay yeah like a very very diverse looking nature here could this be caribbean i think i'll go caribbean again this looks a little bit different than the previous one right or or is it just me this looks a bit different to me very interesting looking fishes almost looking looks fake like so so they look so stiff and straight um let's go i don't know let's go caribbean again i don't know guys i don't know let's guess caribbean oh for frick's sake it's asia it's oceania again or does this condemnate is asia already i don't know um it was indonesia it was near cape cree okay still on zero points so doing amazing excel catelynn seaview survey again the author of this one um what do we have here day month year altitude longitude well if i so wait latitude it's a little below equatorial line longitude 143 so the zero is here 143 it should be i mean also taking into account that it's the same author as the previous well the previous one the author was different but it said uh catalan sea view survey so i think it should could be somewhere nearby again i think so latitude negative 12 longitude 140 i think it it's around here maybe that would be my guess all right all right it was more more to the east even so 140 is here then okay again the great barrier reef at least i got some points this time i'm happy about that again same author any no no coordinates this time uh not here okay the sea life this time isn't as colorful here not many colorful fishes just some some dark ones um okay let's go again pure guess your guess but let's go this part is very colorful as we found out so maybe let's go somewhere near again here in caribbean this time maybe oh seriously it's uh moroccan coast monaco coast amazing oh oh my god two points two points okay and the last one f the suffering will be over okay again catlin sea view survey this looks like a very deep like trench or something like we're on the edge or on an engine oh of a very deep trench that's really fascinating um is this a tortoise or turtle okay let's go great barrier reef somewhere here again northern part somewhere near papua new guinea that would be my guess let's let's see if that's right one two three hundred and twenty three points it was near philippines this time it was sulu see and in this map i got whopping 451 points let me know in the comments if you did better than me in this map again every dollar made from this video will be donated to team c's so share this video so we raise more money and also visit teams that are to help us reach 30 million dollars raised by the

guarded and others you don't even notice uh it should not be too difficult since we know that we are on a border we'll we'll see might turn out to be very difficult who knows but the links will be in the description you can play along you don't need to have a pro account to play just make sure to play it before watching this video um so what is this obra ruta national so what border is this uh we have a black car we have a black car argentino argentina so yeah well i was thinking it probably is argentina which border though that is the big question argentina is pretty big country so would be nice to know with which country is this border with um i don't see any flags there uh so we are exiting argentina to our east so i'm thinking this might be like uruguayan border possibly not there though no there is there a river here there isn't a river or is there a river there somewhere that i don't see what there is a small small river here oh god this is too little time guys i don't know ah i don't know too little time i was up there is the border with paraguay um okay i went with uruguay makes sense makes sense okay we have some rifts in the sky this is europe chronos so where is the border oh there is the border uh any flags hello okay this is probably montenegro right now we have only one blue strip on the plate so montenegro going like that so is this like border with albania what oh my god this is confusing guys it might be a border with serbia here i have no idea there are a bunch of houses around oh my god but i don't know let's leave it there oh my god it was all the way up here oh my god it was with serbia oh no 125 kilometers away not doing super well what is this james daletsky is the author this is a photosphere so we can't move around and we cannot trust the compass uh well this feels like africa but again like it could be anywhere in africa there are some mountains what which border could this be i don't recognize the bollards [Music] could this pretty red soil green mountains i don't know where are the mountains i know there are mountains some mountains like here could it be somewhere like here like south africa and mozambique border i no clue guys no clue it's quite risky let's maybe uh but there are no let's go maybe somewhere go mozambique zimbabwe there seem to be some mountains here so maybe or somewhere there a little bit more north oh it was all the way up here in burundi burundi in tanzania border okay 1500 points from this round not good at all so oh this is an official coverage what such a terrible coverage canada so this is a u.s canada border perfect coverage amazing coverage um outlet um um are you kidding me that look you literally can't read anything 30. what is the state road 30 but i guess we can have a look at the border which state has a road 30 when entering canada if we have enough time to find it if we have time to find it oh no 24 13 16. 28 oh god i'm running out of time 30 30 30. let's go i mean it must be here then border lounge is there a border lounge here is that a border lounge no it's an outlet oh okay we're like here right i think and that that probably is border lounge is it i'm confused i don't know but this should be it what the frick well well i was thinking that something doesn't matter turns out there's another road 30. there is another road 30 when entering canada and it is pretty far away pretty far away from where i was unfortunately so yeah well my plan of finding road 30 failed i would have been much better just plonking it somewhere here oh no oh no okay and round five okay what is this border okay one of the countries is france is the other one like luxembourg or something we're exiting france we're entering which country with this bollard oh i can't read anything this this this this uh oh this is belgium oh so french and france and belgium of the oh god where which which border so the it goes basically north basically north oh it could be anywhere here it could be anywhere zone refuge what is this is that oh that's not the shape of the place i don't think orga philippe or philippe can we find forge philippe i don't see forgive philippa guys not too bad actually not too bad taking in god that was just a random oh here is forge philippe was it on my screen when i was looking through i don't know but it is here yeah it is here oh send ron i think he said cendron as well okay at least one of the rounds was pretty good at least one of the rounds so in total 14 838 points oh i was i was hoping for something better let's try it again let's try it again guys oh no not single player uh challenge so the link will be in the description let's go can i get more than fourteen thousand points wonderful indones visa free uh to indonesia so is this like malaysia indonesia border or something we have indonesian flag uh indonesia we are we are exiting indonesia to our east wait is this papua new guinea are there any roads connecting indonesian papua new guinea no so this isn't papua new guinea i mean it must be it must be like malaysia somewhere right there are no other land borders indonesia's land borders with malaysia and papua new guinea that's it i don't see any flags there oh god there are no roads i'm so this this can't be there look the more freaking lester i forgot it exists oh no i forgot timor-leste exists it makes so much more sense oh no oh no i forgot it exists oh that's a terrible start oh what what the hell is this now this is official coverage what oh my god this will be even worse than the first game oh no oh no this is a border particularly the border is just a jungle it's some sort of a national park why is it covered officially google doesn't usually cover just random forests so this is probably like a national park is this that ugandan national park by any chance like this one where they have the uh ak guy with an ak-47 following us at some points getting kind of those vibes here i haven't seen that guy though but i'm kind of getting those those vibes from this coverage but just around the corner might be that guy guarding us maybe i think it was this nash like national park or whatever this is okay this was uganda just the other other side of uganda makes sense i guess it did feel very similar to this one does it make sense it would be a different ugandan national park okay what do we have here a north high invest fallen um [Music] what do we have here what is it is this it feels kind of like the netherlands that the language the all large i think they're the dutch so we are going north huh not travis it must be the the netherlands and germany uh north high invest fallen is it on the map somewhere are the hanfest fallen is it on the uh i don't see it we have only 15 more seconds this this might not be it might be over like the name of the region or something so it might not even be on the map i think yeah let's the road goes wait it was belgium oh god it was a belgian boullard oh no i mixed up my bollards guys this is not my day clearly clearly this is not my day okay ecuador ecuador is to our west ecuador is to our west which country is to our east we don't see probably colombia i would imagine or could this be just no i don't think this is that is peru probably colombia this one maybe ecuador to west columbia to east there's like a bridge here i think we should be like here i think seems there's like a kind of like like a roundabout looking thing yeah colombia it is colombia colombia i'm pretty sure it should be this this place but we are we on ecuadorian side or no we're in the colombian side oh we are on the colombian side oh no over an ecuadorian side no oh no one oh my god this is confusing gracias thank you for being so we are exiting ecuador so we're on ecuadorian side oh my god that was confusing so we are somewhere here somewhere here okay okay okay five thousand points okay i'll take it gladly take five thousand points here okay and the last round last border of this video venezuela venezuela and bolivar something apolivar is the like the currency so yeah it has nothing to do with bolivia so venezuela so is that the border with colombia we have a bunch of yellow plates yellow back plates that i can see so it probably is colombian and ecuadorian yeah colombia colombian and venezuelan border which one which one there is a big river here um would be here is there is like a river here right i mean there certainly is like a bridge i don't see there is a very small river oh no is it is it is is that the river i don't think that is it either i think this might be it and maybe the river has dried up or something i think we might be around here possibly i didn't it didn't go further down the road it was here yeah nice okay and we turned out turns out we were actually in venezuela already it was a spilled coverage venezuela doesn't usually have google coverage but in some countries you can get like a little bit across the border so 19 000 points okay so we did better in uh than in the first game well i did better than in the first game let me know how you did in the comments below and if you did better than me in any of these games two other videos i think you will enjoy will appear on the right side of your screen huge thanks to all of the members for supporting this channel and if you would like to remember

country so let's see what locations do we get let's do it as a challenge one and a half minutes per round with moving around if we can uh the link will be in the description if you want to play along just make sure you do it before watching this video and you can play along with a free version as well of geoguesser you don't need to have a pro um okay uh i'm not sure what what vibes am i getting it seems that the we have some head scarfs possibly people uh women might be wearing some head scarves here so it might be like a muslim country possibly the what is that flag oh god what was that flag i think i know that ah i don't know what country that flag represents i think i know which which flag it is but of course i don't remember which country it was oh god damn it like a big circle in the middle oh which one was it it was one of the african countries guys i don't know flags zambia could have could have been zambia oh god damn it oh there's no chance we can read any text and we can't move around here either so that sucks um i don't know which i'm pretty sure it was an african country but which one let's just guess central african republic i thought it was an ethiopian flag now that i can find it uh but it wasn't turns out i guess it was some other flag so it was central african republic so i only got 600 points on this round oh that's not not the best start unfortunately but okay let's see if we can get better we have some turkish language here some arabic language as well some english hmm some sort of a memorial uh like monument question is this turkey is this this probably is turkey i would say oh it might be like a neighboring country somewhere could it be syria do we go on kara i haven't been to turkey i have no idea if this is like a famous place in turkey or somewhere else um i mean the the houses feel like they might be found in turkey definitely in that area somewhere turkey may be one of these countries let's go on kara since it's the capital maybe it's like a famous place in ankara ah it was oh it was damascus it actually was syria damn and the thought did cross my mind hmm okay so it was damascus fair enough fair enough still 2500 points could be worse so this is an official coverage for a change project so we can move around here um do not throw trash okay how can we get down this is like a what is this place we have a spanish speaking country right oh oh we have some text here number some sort of a bird like there is this like description of this bird i guess you can see a lot of those birds around 20 seconds remaining oh i think could this be mexico somewhere here i don't know maybe okay it was not mexico it was guatemala turns out it was guatemala what was it was what was that place uh templo de la serpiente self-fala okay parkway national decay decal oh otical national park okay um i guess it's a famous place in guatemala i had never heard of it before but okay still 3 700 points i'll take it taking an inco into account i had no idea where it was 3 700 points uh is okay so we have a big hand holding us here and the author author's name is sagir some sort of a pathway through jungle where do they have jungles where do they have jungles uganda kenya tanzania i i don't know it could be anywhere drc could it be drc maybe should we should we plonk in the middle of the drc sort of in the middle of of this area maybe a little bit north like maiko national park i i i have no idea wildlife reserve let's go here maybe wildlife reserve it's completely i have no idea it was nigeria lagos so close to lagos wow what was it leki conservation center scenic 78 hecto hectare hectare uh nature preserve okay it did seem like like a in the middle of jungle so i'm very surprised it is so close to the to the city such a big city as lagos so that one is tricky damn i'm doing very poorly here see you guys all have a very very relatively easy job to beat me i again i have no idea where this is most touristic locations cute horses and is that a cow not sure um hmm this river i've seen some youtube videos where they looked like like boats like these i don't remember which countries were they was it uganda no this isn't like victoria though definitely not burundi i don't remember guys i'm having such a bad memory so i remember i've seen like uh people like maybe it was drew binsky's video possibly where he and some some other people were like traveling with these boats but like a bridge pretty big bridge is there a bridge across this lake no um oh god let's go i don't know congo river let's go somewhere here are you see oh my god it was mali what wow how many points did he get 7 600 points oh my god that was just terrible that was just terrible this is a very difficult map for me personally since i don't know famous places i don't know touristic places so yeah this this is a tough one let's try it again let's try it again one more one more challenge again link in the description maybe maybe i can do better i mean i must must be able to do better than 7 600 right so we have like a big big cruise ship died died up here um [Music] feels like a yeah like an island i'm guessing this might be one of these islands possibly i'm getting getting that sort of a feel um we are okay we're in like the port right next to the city pretty hilly pretty mountainous we can't trust compass since this is unofficial coverage we cannot trust compass here gotta keep that in mind um like the shape feels like no not there i'm trying to look at these look at the shape of the shape of the the island and figure out which one it might be maybe here i have no idea but there is so it's so difficult to tell especially without the compass some grenadines no idea let's let's go dominica let's go dominica and then see it was grenada uh ah it yeah makes sense yeah the shape makes sense ah had the right to like thoughts thoughts thought process just chose the wrong wrong island ah that sucks that sucks okay we can move around here we have some is that thai possibility of a visit um or is this oh is the sound car what this might be ankara what in the from the inside i've never i don't think i've ever been inside ankara what all the times i've seen it from outside but i i think we had some uh the cambodian flag yeah yeah this is angkor wat where was ankar what it was somewhere up here um cross in this city was it yeah here it is ankara what um so we are kind of it is to our east where did we start we started somewhere inside um i don't know maybe here let's go let's go let's guess here oh let's go 5k oh my god i'm glad that at least one round i 5k to be fair this was an easy easy round but i'll take it i will take it hans is this like italy is this coliseum i've never been is it not no it isn't no no no no this doesn't feel like coliseum but what else is this though what is this then i've never been to coliseum i have no idea how it looks from inside again and i know how it looks from the outside like who doesn't right but from the inside hmm but i don't think like in colosseum you would have just like have some some room for people to watch what's happening but there aren't really any like like stands around or anything i have no idea i'm guessing this might be like europe maybe greece let's let's still go i don't know okay let's go let's go rome but i'm thinking might be italy might be like greece feels like feels like probably europe but let's i don't know let's go coliseum because i don't have a better guess but it was coliseum actually okay i i had imagined coliseum to look differently from the inside okay i guess now i know i'm glad i did go with coliseum last second uh got 5k points i'll take it i'm doing way better this uh this um game than in the previous one james deletsky james daletsky okay we can move around but will it will will it will it help us so this is like like um the bird watching tower or something i don't know guards tower watchtower something this this is just like uh completely random just pick an african country and then hope for the best kind of okay we can't go any further that direction which african country could this be i i literally no idea could be anywhere um let's go with rwanda or burundi malawi i don't know you won the game reserve let's let's go here i have literally zero idea tanzania oh it was burundi actually okay so didn't go didn't end up going burundi but uh i'm very happy with this guess to be honest it could have been way worse could have been way worse and the last round what what is this is this chai no i've seen like similar mountains in china before but is it this i mean these are tourists so oh doggos cute can we we can't read what it says no text i'm definitely getting asian vibes from this like house not sure if if china or maybe it is like nepal or or or or something there somewhere there could these people ton definitely feels in this area kind of in this area to me shall we go bhutan or shall we go nepal kind of kind of leaning towards nepal to be honest um let's go here kind of eastern and nepal i mean this might as well be indie i guess let's go here i don't have a better one ah it was bhutan um well it was one of the countries that i thought it would be ah it was bhutan well i would have probably guessed eastern bhutan either way so it's not that much worse let's view summaries 20 600 puts way better than the first game i am happy with this well to be fair there were a couple of easy rounds the encore what and the coliseum those two were like three five k's if i had more time i probably would have found granada this this one i got lucky and this one also i'll take it i'll take it so leave it in the comments below how did you

flags etc so i already don't know all of the country flags so if we get some state flags i am so screwed but um yeah let's let's try let's try let's do it there's a challenge two minutes per game uh the links will be in the description if you want to play along you don't need to have a pro account to play along just make sure you play it before uh watching this video so i don't spoil it to you so let's go well this is the us of a the us of america i don't know what this is this is an island right or is it or maybe it isn't it felt like an island at first maybe it isn't what what does it say kentucky okay well maybe it isn't an island wait where is kentucky guys oh god damn it where is kentucky god damn it here is kentucky okay kentucky fried chicken right right right right a little bit of chicken shape chicken shaped state um okay kentucky transportation cabinet well if it's a transportation cabinet then i would i would assume it's in the state capital right is louis louisville louise louisville louisville i don't know but i'm guessing um that's the state capital maybe so uh merrow street 200 and 200 merrow street the street goes like this okay and it looks like we might be in the southern part of the city possibly merrow street mero street third street no saint andrews well the chance of us fighting freaking mero street is very low but terry road well maybe let's go a little bit closer to the city center phillips lane yeah i know it might not even be this city for all i know it just it's kentucky and it because of this this cabinet i'm thinking it might be the capital if this is even is the capital of kentucky sometimes the capitals aren't the largest cities in the state which i find amusing so it was frankfort okay well okay well it was kentucky at least so 77 kilometers i will take it could be worse could be way worse so good job me is this malaysia i think this is malaysia um okay so i don't know what's the other flag oh yeah that's definitely a malaysian flag there that's definitely malaysian flags oh we haven't even a sign here hello okay so koala berang oh god road number three man near road number three this is probably yeah row number three hello who so was there pekka no with the respon pantai [Music] can we find maneer somewhere oh my god voila oh god damn it just just to make sure let's check if there is a road three here oh no there is a road three on the other island oh god damn it that's bad what is why is there another freaking road three oh but that road three is super small okay okay okay um but i don't see any of these places though quantum quality 14 where's road 14 maybe maybe we can find road 14 14 is here 14 it goes here so are we like somewhere here and this intersection somewhere maybe does it uh or does it align i don't have time to check if it aligns correctly okay wrong intersection but oh i will take this gladly only three and a half kilometers away wrong intersection but uh the right area so very good very good next round okay so this is unofficial a lovely swiss flag i know this flag that's a big plus big plus of switzerland um hmm well i i i don't think i will find any clues of where is it zh well that's probably tsuri right s e f ah okay plates are all over the place i'm garten look like a hotel i'm guessing with different like lags well this is like like a ski resort i'm guessing they're like 101 ski resorts in switzerland so it's not like that hubs well we have that one car from turis so maybe we are somewhere at least near zurich maybe what was that other other um other plate i couldn't read that z h s e where could s e be from which city i don't see any that would make sense for s e hmm 30 seconds remaining you know i don't know i don't see any any sc's shelf enough housing could that be sc no idea maybe well i will do a risky guess guessing the very north of switzerland if it isn't then we will lose some points but let's let's go for north okay i mean definitely could be way worse it was kinda close to just the the other way which okay fair enough oh sc might have been saint gallon maybe maybe anyways next round if anyone any swiss viewers know where where is se from let me know oh this these are faro islands right this lovely flag guys just chilling or ladies just chilling with with maybe like a kindergarten group or something so um it seems like a pretty big port lots of containers and stuff [Music] let's go let's go [Music] maybe like somewhere here let's let's have a look around does this align we can't trust the compass because this isn't official but we are like like it looks like we are like a not an island what do you call this this this kind of thingy so we might be here we might be here i don't really have anything to to align it with i think this could be it i think this definitely could be it let's go let's guess hey let's go 5k 47 meters away but still 5k very nice very nice let's go next round last one oh no so this was oh the stars kind of make an h right someone told it in my chat in one of my live streams so i think it's honduras because the stars i think they like you can imagine that the stars kind of make an h later because i always mix up these these flags i always mix them up they're super similar to me um san felipe is san felipe a city san felipe i don't see any sun philippe's here don't see any san felipes okay so it is by drc vista honduras okay the the author literally says honduras so it is honduras um okay cool uh where where in honduras now that's the next question i have no idea what any of that means it is even one of these words maybe a little play location maybe not oh but wait we can move around wait this isn't the photo sphere we can move around um i realized it a little bit too late so where is this where is this bus going i want to find out come on with the salsa is it actually salsa is that a place san pedro sula sauce i don't see any sauces this is unofficial so this could be anywhere oh god i wanted to change it because i realized how small this place is well it's still like decently sized city but yeah should have just logged it in capital ah god damn it god damn it i wanted to switch it but i realized i didn't have enough time so 24 000 points though that's really good that is really good one 24 and twelve point let's go let's play it again let's do one more again link in oh no not single player whoops uh link in the description let's go so is this austrian flag or is th this is ukrainian flag what the hell is this i don't know uh land tag land dog well lantac does sound german right so i'm guessing this is austria um i wonder why is there ukrainian flag there i understand austria and european union maybe maybe ukraine was like the like the the governing country for i think they switched like every six months or something i don't know let's let's see if we can find this looks like a big like european union building so i would imagine it's like in vienna maybe or maybe salt i don't know would it be in salzburg can we find any clues if it still wasn't apparent that we are in austria it says usted which means austria in german um well let's let's plonk it in vienna because we don't have much time i still haven't verified that this actually is vienna oh hello is it vienna is this vienna any any any uh oh [Music] is this vienna i don't think it is actually but i don't know where else would it be with such a big governmental building centro veen oh god okay i thought i switched it last second but i guess it didn't register i wanted to guest somewhere like i guess here because it said like a veen vienna in that direction uh so it made me realize okay we are definitely not in vienna oh where was it oh saint paul it is actually the place okay would i have been able to find it i guess i would have yeah it's actually pretty big okay fair enough okay that's what i get for not knowing saint pulpin oh well definitely could have gotten a better score there oh well uh so this is japan right this is the locum camera we have some japanese language zero five four phones starting with zero five four zero starting with zero three it's tokyo zero six is osaka zero five four might be near nagoya maybe i don't know exactly where it is um well i don't understand anything what that says um there seems to be some english but office something yeah okay um not very promising oh i just realized that this is the like the flags so i wasn't even paying attention to the flag in the previous in this one um in the start but we have some flags here okay japan's number one green tea brand ito n is that the t brand or i'm guessing that's the t brand not not the city and the boss is gone lovely oh and the bus is back well i don't really understand either way where where it's heading so oh wait there is um i don't see any synagogues okay i'm guessing somewhere near nagoya because that's that's just based on the phone number but it might be completely wrong okay it's all the way here okay fair enough fair enough okay okay so we have a black car is this peru this car feels very peruvian to me but uh let's wait where is the flag this is supposed to be flags of the world what the hell is that flag that's probably like a regional flag right so i have no idea no idea where that original flag is from oh i are okay it's argentina not peru good to know good to know good to know good to know which city which city um pretty big a pedestrian street total sale oh god damn it okay everything's in spanish trying to find like maybe some city names but radio taxi micro pancho i have no idea which city could this be should we go buenos aires just the capital or could it be like cordoba rosario something else seems like a pretty big city so it's probably one of those three should we do let's go rosario actually kind of in the middle if those three are my options let's go in the middle that's that's my thinking here okay so it was neither one of neither of those three uh but uh okay this was at least closer than buenos aires a little bit it was santiago del estero okay wasn't even considering that okay what is this flag i cannot tell what the hell is that flag well this is japan again okay another japanese location any phone numbers that's the only thing i know kind of know at least zero eight this looks like uh doesn't look like a useful phone number though okay there's like a sign above our heads totsuka kawasaki totsuka road number one it which is probably like super big and doesn't help as much otsuka kawasaki god damn it kawasaki there is road too road 8 road 4 road 6 road 7 road 5 okay amazing i didn't see road 1. god damn it i might have glanced it over i don't know let's go near tokyo i don't really have much time left either way so let's go near tokyo and and see how close we are probably not very close but oh a new badge popular creator you build a fun map people will like it oh did my map okay it was yokohama down here it was actually near tokyo so 489 points let's go ggs ggs i think that i got that badge because a map of mine called a learning world has just reached 1 000 likes i think the last time i checked it was missing two likes so i think two more people have liked it so if you haven't checked it out i will leave the link to it in the description it's like designed for new players if you are learning geo guesser that's the map to try uh but yeah it was here next round yeah if you do enjoy this video press that like button it really helps the algorithm to to show this uh video to more people so this is canada i don't know the provinces i don't know the province flags departures the parts so we we have the text in french as well white horse that he is glitched i don't think there are two e's actually i think it might be like prince edward island or something these i i don't think i've ever seen this flag well at least i don't remember and it's i'm thinking it might be like a small one and can we find a white hor white white horse maybe i don't see white horse on prince edward island though so it might not be here hmm nova scotia i don't know how the flag of nova scotia well i know only flag off we're back basically that's the only only canadian province flag that i know i guess maybe let's let's try to look for more clues more info arrivals immediate pickup passengers some golden taxi no front plates i don't know where in canada they have or or don't have front plates 16 seconds oh what do we have here yukon okay that helps yukon white horse uh where where are the arrivals i don't know where is it like a boss bus stop or bus terminal okay here international airport oh it was an airport okay fair enough okay so we found a white horse in the last second literally oh okay so one and a half kilometer away let's do the summary 22 822 points still pretty good result that argentinian round was my worst one here surprisingly i did surprisingly well in japan let me know in the comments how did you do in these challenges and two other videos you might find interesting will appear on the right side of your screen huge thanks to all the members for

at first so that's the eiffel tower replica um okay we're somewhere in i'm guessing canada smith rip okay not canada we use miles here so this is the u.s then but phil is definitely northern to me feels like northern us oh can we find any clues you guys know i'm bad at us you know that oh so we have a road us199 us199 uh i don't think that helps us much does it 2 20s yeah yeah okay oh wait 191 could it be close it could be close it could be far away so uh let's let's look for more clues maybe the state ca okay see wait ca i i don't think that ca stands for canada which state had ca as the ca california okay could this be california i'm guessing that's what the ca stands for and what road was it 199 road 199 in california can we find it oh god damn it well not uh not not from the first glance i don't see road 199 at least from this zoom 198 are you serious 198 okay great nice um i don't know let's oh the time already i ran out oh my god i'm glad i plonked it somewhere i went to check with how much time do i have left and i noticed one second oh my god so okay it was all the way up here oh road 199 yeah i guess yeah i hadn't zoomed in enough but i saw 101 i didn't see 199 maybe if i had zoomed in more maybe well if i had more time i would have definitely found it but oh well okay i mean could be worse at least we found the state that's a that's a pretty good um start i would at least for me uh something clinic well okay let's first look around is this the us again okay okay where do we have the oh this is the eiffel tower replica okay let's move a bit closer so we can see we can admire it properly bordeaux center that's a pretty nice replica much bigger than the previous one uh bordeaux tower at bordeaux i don't know where bordeaux is guys well not in the us um first citizens bank such an american name walgreens john england looking for like maybe again state abbreviations or something cape cape fear valley no idea where that is either do not enter uh yeah pine valley speed limit nationwide is on your side cool cool cool which state are we in nc is that the state nc which state is nc nc nc is here north carolina okay we have 28 more seconds i hope that's the state uh i'm i'm glad we found it this looks like a pretty big city looks like a pretty big city so what's the biggest city in north carolina charlotte might not be charlotte though i don't know let's go charlotte though it might be like one of the other ones but that's my best guess here looks like a pretty big city this one wasn't charlotte it was fayetteville fayetteville okay so blocking in the middle would have been a better choice i guess i guess but oh well still the right state i'm i'm very happy with getting the correct state in america yeah because uh north america isn't my best uh best area to guess okay amazing are you serious this is america again we have u-haul chicago just because it says chicago doesn't mean that this is chicago well i'll probably end up guessing chicago either way because i there's no i have no clue one of these might be the state flag i don't know yeah this is the eiffel tower this is an unofficial coverage we have like this cowboy hat which maybe indicates that we are like closer to texas i don't know like i always associate the cowboy hats with texas but um i don't know like this i'm not gonna i'm not gonna trust that chicago i'll i'd rather go texas like near dallas or something as these u-hauls can have like these stickers from from anywhere just because it says chicago doesn't mean that we are anywhere close to it that's what i think um is there any point of of spending more time in this location there's like a school bus there yeah let's let's just guess i'm guessing dallas okay it was not dallas it was paris paris texas eiffel tower wow okay i didn't know that there was paris in texas if i had known that i would have probably gone to paris in texas makes sense yeah the cowboy the cowboy hat on the top of the eiffel tower definitely helped me here it is such a such a texas thing to do i would say okay so let's go with the next round okay here is the replica up until now all the locations have been in the us which is okay this is canada this time which i mean isn't us but still it's north america i know for a fact that there are locations outside of us in this map so i feel like i haven't been very lucky with this seed a free samsung galaxy cool cool where are we which pro province are we in plains view uh can't read it oh okay um catalog here seers john's i don't think it says the province anywhere there municipal library building i don't know the state flags or the province flags god damn it yeah this this will be a bad one i have no clue no clue where in canada we are absolutely zero idea well we are definitely in canada i know that much but yeah besides that no clue now we're in like a like a private private like a house area ah winnipeg i don't know let's go near maybe it's near winnipeg no idea no idea very flat very flat i think winnipeg is pretty flat and saskatchewan let's go here kind of in the middle as well for hedging purposes um if the time is up oh okay it was saskatchewan still i'll take it i'll take it we got the wrong province well i was thinking in between these two because of how flat it was so okay it was it was saskatchewan but uh still 368 kilometers away for north america i will gladly take it okay and this is the last round eiffel tower and for a change it's not north america can you believe it i can't i can't believe it so this is austria this is austria and eisenstadt oh god damn it i don't know where that is eisenstein i don't know how big that place is is it worth looking for eisenstadt 50 s4 i don't see any s16 s oh god damn it okay yeah i don't think there is a point of looking for an s4 road oh damn it if you had more time you could definitely 5k this but with a limited time and me not being the best 50s word maybe we can find 50 65 64. are they grouped together s3 50s 90s oh my god are they grouped together or no i don't see anything starting with oh 50s oh here we have 50 okay 50. oh ober pulandov open polandoff is to our uh south west oben pulandov over pulandorf here to our south what was the other one i already forgot but let's go somewhere here i don't know the last round always takes longer to load okay oh it was oh even more to the north even more to the north up here or 50 went all the way up here okay fair enough farah but still 24 kilometers away i will gladly take it uh well glad i think so what's the summary 21 175 points which i would say a pretty good score especially taking into account that four of the locations were in north america which yeah isn't the best uh area for me to guess let's do one more let's do one more again two minutes per round uh challenge so the link in the description let's do one more uh attensa attensau i don't know if you that's how you say it but that is portuguese that is portuguese and this is brazil uh so wait where the the replica where is the replica wait is that the eiffel tower replica okay um very interesting replica i guess it's like like the chimney of a factory that is made to look kind of like an eiffel tower um [Music] some pretty big like like uh rides here like a theme park or something um can we find out where we are doesn't help well there seems to be a big road here and big road would hopefully mean big signs towards cities sao paulo let's go sao paulo is to our north west san paolo so we might be near very near san paulo maybe that's possible oh what's the other place but that's hotel i don't know if that's the name of itapevi that we have here not e to pever i don't know if is the place name or is it just the name of the hotel oh let's see what do we have on those signs maybe they can help as well okay sao paulo left hoppy hottie hoppy wet and wild a lot of theme parks here like this is like like a water park okay uh any sense in the other other direction maybe oh we ran out of time okay okay so okay not too bad not too bad 75 kilometers so it was more to the north west okay not a bad start at a bad start so this is the next one this is a photo sphere this time so we won't be able to move around okay let's see what can we find here a really cool like a replica [Music] do not enter signs this is a very poor quality the author is ash bulagadan as you can see in the bottom right corner she doesn't really help us i don't think these houses feel kind of european to me lianduro oh my god i can't read anything hmm i don't know like these these the cars and the houses the style feels kind of european but um i'm i don't know this lienduro sounds i don't know spanish maybe could this be spain though the architecture doesn't feel spanish i'm confused here i'm just thoroughly confused maybe a spanish island let's go let's go palma here in palma i i don't think it is palma but i just don't have a better guess this feels like an island like we have like sea or ocean here at least in that direction yeah well let's let's let's make a guess it was france i was considering france i was considering france but yeah i don't know the language the the name of that store just felt more spanish to me yeah that wasn't a very good round uh so next one access strict the strictment okay okay it looks like a french flag again well it looks looks like one yeah the sign looks very french as well so okay so we're in france again yeah french bollards um that doesn't help i don't think the numbers in france are just terrible we no point in looking for them uh well let's let's block it somewhere in france for now but uh maybe we can find something useful probably not but we can try we can try d80 oh there's a sign there's a sign maybe i know some of this is mulhouse belfort heimsburn belfort belfort have i heard of belfort before or mulhouse i don't know maybe belfort or mulhouse teleport house um i don't see any of them on the map belfort or mulhouse yeah time is running out very quickly so i think we'll just have to have to have to have to [Music] i guess randomly yeah i don't know any of those places either okay so let's just i don't know plonk it here and see the other side okay belfort for mulhouse okay oh but yeah you really need to zoom in to see them yeah i was like on this zoom level i would have needed to zoom in a little bit more oh well yeah this game is definitely worse for me uh so we have the uh eiffel tower lombard looks russian yeah the car isn't visible uh well this is russia this is russia but i don't see the city name anywhere trying to look at the signs maybe one of them has like the city name that i recognize uh federal provider selling internet sauna um this side maybe i don't think it says the city doesn't say the city we have one more minute remaining i was complaining about getting u.s locations and now i'm getting russia um yeah i don't see any any city names there either um i mean this feels like a big city okay we're running out of time seems like a big city but i don't know it does doesn't feel like moscow or saint petersburg to me let's go yekaterinburg maybe just a random guess just because i don't think it's moscow or seat saint petersburg let's see and it was krasnoyarsk it was even more to the east oh my god it was all the way across new york yeah and we only get 1100 points uh out of this round that's that's rough so the final round the final round so we have a nice eiffel tower like cafe looking nice shopping center casino international a very tourist touristy area beer in germany well the beer is from germany it doesn't mean that we are okay we have some cyrillic excuses i don't know where these places are i'm guessing they're like famous places tourist places i just you guys know how i am with geography um so yeah um it is bulgaria okay i was kind of kind of thinking this might be bulgaria because of the cyrillic okay that i mean the health flag helps so balchik kaliyakar so we are near water obviously to our east which well makes sense uh so what what did we have here called kalakra balchik a locker ball chick it smells like a touristy place so i'm guessing it's like a big city and kalakara and balchik [Music] i'm guessing either burgas or varna 10 seconds oh god damn it burgess let's go here let's go in burgess i don't know if you think the alliance it aligns better i might be wrong but i think it aligns better with a compass no all it was neither it was neither it was off of outside of varna goddammit vana would have been a much better guess oh well yeah no chance i would have found this golden sands yeah oh well uh 99 kilometers away still not too bad but i would have been much closer though oh well let's do the summary of 15 842 points well worse than in the previous uh previous game but still could be worse could be worse how did you do leave it in the

randomly put you in one of the 198 country capitals including somaliland uh so let's see let's do a challenge let's do one and a half minute no moving let's do one and a half minute now moving the links will be in the description you do not need to have a pro account to play along uh but make sure to play before watching this video so i don't spoil anything oh god okay so all of these locations are inaccurate oh no i don't know flags oh god damn it oh hate i don't know flags guys oh no oh no png papua new guinea right okay papua new guinea what was was one of my guesses which fl which uh like this might be okay png committed to papua new guinea oil oil search okay good good so this is like a like a pretty big football stadium can we find it in time guys that means sir john guys stadium is that it i don't see it on them like here but i don't know if that that's the ones that's the stadium but uh that might be it maybe it is in the capital city there are probably some other stadiums here as well but well i just don't see them so we're guessing here hopefully it is right it isn't it isn't it was a different stadium which also wasn't on the map but anyways at least at least i got the uh red country damascus i love damascus damascus damascus damascus um [Music] well probably quite central right you because of this first of all because of the sun you usually get these like touristy signs in quite central places um some sort of like a soldier here soldier statue we cannot trust the compass by the way because this is not official coverage um this is like a big roundabout right this is like a big big roundabout so we oh um would it be like oh would we be like somewhere there are like roads going yeah we're like somewhere here we're somewhere here sword monument it's a sword monument i love damascus monument yes yes yes yes yes here we are i love damascus monument we're like in the middle basically but between the monument and the in the street somewhere there is like a sword-something monument damascus damascaine sword monument okay nine meters away let's go let's go 5k okay what is this huh iran is this uh irani is there any flag i think might be um samsung well there aren't really any landmarks here to do or maybe this is a landmark i don't know but yeah this the author's name is matin as you can see at the bottom right corner so doesn't really help us but i mean we know it's it's the capital city i think this is iran looks like the uh iranian uh iranian flag i think i'm not the best at flags though uh and again we cannot trust the compass so we just i think we just block it somewhere in the in the middle of tehran and hope for the best okay it was iran we're too far away as well so pretty good oh no oh no okay again unofficial coverage clearly and i don't see any any hints where could we be well this definitely feels like an island c a clark is the author c a clarke and zed made so made in new zealand remind me i was thinking maybe one of these islands if the strap is made in new zealand so maybe it's near new zealand i was thinking maybe maybe one of these islands may be one of these islands um so let's go wally's send for futuna or should we go or should we go just fiji suva maybe let's go fiji it's kind of kind of in the middle of this this pack kind of let's go fiji i guess okay not bad it was samoa okay fair enough i mean could be worse we got 1800 points but for for island guessing i feel like 1800 points is very good but nz made really helped here okay this is turkey this is even official coverage yeah um we have so easy lay uh sankaya easily tan kaya what are those like books are those cities or district names or something i don't see easily or tankaya yeah maybe you need to see me zoom in more i don't know well i don't see those places on the map but i mean we should be in ankara right radisson blue looks like the city bigger city part is to our north so i'm guessing in the southern part of ankara do we by any chance can notice radisson blue hotel somewhere here huh by any chance i probably should have looked at the road road direction let's go here and it was not the southern part of ankara so i was wrong with that assumption it was like literally the center okay fair enough fair enough okay i've where is i don't even see the radisson hotel maybe it isn't on the map i don't know but anyways like uh 20 almost 22 000 points pretty good score pretty good score now let's do another one let's do another challenge uh challenge 1.3 uh 1.5 minutes let's go trans-millennial official coverage is this is this brazil oh no oh no never mind we have all the yellow plates okay this is colombia then colombia very big very big boss what the hell that's a big boss um [Music] are we like near an airport maybe is there an airport somewhere here there is an airport i'm thinking maybe this boss like takes people from from an airport or something maybe i don't know so the road direction is uh huh oh that's not it there may be this with like something in the middle or here this one i don't know some somewhere in bogota let's let's switch to the middle ah god damn it i was my first plonk was closer my first block was closer 12 kilometers away ah okay uh where are these oh god where are these taxis from uruguay or no no yes no maybe a black car might be uruguay where these uruguayan taxis or were they peruvian taxis oh god damn it one of the two i think one of the two i don't know guys either peru or your uruguay i i'm gonna go i'm gonna go with uruguay i might be wrong though but my first my first instinct was uruguay when i saw this taxi the road is going that so i don't know maybe somewhere here i don't know let's see okay it was uruguay it was monte video just again chose the chose the wrong part oh but i'll take it oh god what is this okay um your logo here sponsored by your logo here areas area perspective now arie expected um this doesn't help lovely again some some island island nation i would guess i don't know i'm thinking could this be like cyprus by any chance could this be cyprus by any chance for some reason i'm getting some european vibes but that my vibes might be wrong my vibes might be completely wrong here should i go cyprus aries that doesn't help the author's name doesn't help us that's quite risky if it's not cyprus then we get like zero points basically but let's keep it in cyprus let's let's let's risk it for the biscuit oh but oh no that's a capital oh i forgot that these are capitals in cyprus like the capital is in the middle okay so my last last second plunk somewhere here i guess paid off at least i got the holy nice one three three seven uh points um i guess it paid off if i had a little bit more time then i would have had a little bit more points but uh at least there weren't zero points i totally forgot that these are capitals so this looks like the bulgarian flag right and we also have some cyrillic and and i think these uh signs with the green at the top are bulgarian as well so this is sofia swedish barber shop swedish barbershop in sofia sofia well it's not like we're gonna find a swedish barbershop the road is going kind of like that so it might be one of these streets mall of sofia swedish barber shop swedish barbershop now i don't see any swedish barbershops but like uh from the from the road direction it might might be one of these i mean could could be anywhere else as well could be here could be here oh it was all the way up here okay the road was a little bit bigger than i thought and i swedish okay swedish barbershop but you really need to zoom in to find it no chance we would have found it uh and round five okay this looks like andorra andorra yeah andorra it says here even um we are next to a roundabout um enemy 5k it's probably not well there's like a round about here the first round but i saw the road goes very curvy it could be i it could be actually it was literally the first roundabout that i saw but i i i guess they don't have too many roundabouts i mean it's definitely not that not that not that i think we are on the right roundabout guys i think we we 5k this yeah it's not there yeah i think we are on the right roundabout let's just guess it let's go five meters away five meters away it was the right roundabout so let's see the summary how did we do again twenty one and a half thousand around the same score as the first game how did you do let me know in the comments below two other videos i think you might enjoy will appear

"in this video i will be playing a map called i saw the sign which contains the location of the place that we are in somewhere in the front of our location so let's begin the link of the challenge will be in the description if you want to play along just make sure you play along before watching this video so i don't spoil anything so let's go let's go with the first round so we have harriet community center oh god wait are those holy poles oh maybe they just appear to be holy maybe they just appear to be holy poles or are they holy poles there might be holy poles oh well with these signs and i think we have holy poles this should be new zealand then right are these kiwi bollards i cannot really tell but they might be so this should be new zealand then okay well i'm glad it's not like the us right new zealand is way smaller than the us so uh oh and also oh we have an antenna and we okay yeah okay that settles it this is new zealand then harriet i don't think i've heard of harry yet before which isn't good which isn't good oh no oh no okay let's let's let's uh start glancing over slowly maybe maybe we find carry out from from afar if not then we will need to zoom in closer than this and we find harriet okay i did not find harry yet just by glancing over well this looks like well to me this looks like either like in the northern ireland or like the southern part of south southern ireland so let's i guess let's start with southern part of southern island maybe so here yet here yet it was harriet yes harriet okay so okay i do not see harriet in this zoom either which isn't good which isn't good oh god do we really need to zoom in even more okay i do not see it on the on the northern island let's let's glance over the southern one so so so do we see harriet anywhere well it shouldn't be in like the very mountainous area here right so i will focus mostly on like the southern part but i'll probably glance over the northern part too just just in case just in case oh my god i found it oh my god i found it oh my god okay it was near the other one that sounded similar i already lost the other one it was a teriyaki or whatever uh okay but we found harriet we found harriet it's a small place who would have thought so harriet community center shouldn't be difficult to find right so what what direction is this road it is okay almost almost south to north with a turn to the right in the distance imagine this isn't the only harriet in new zealand that would be like a slap in the face i see no community centers nearby though so well that that sucks no community center at least not on the map i'm not looking for another harriet in new zealand let me tell you that much um i cannot read the road names so no no chance of using that as as our help this this sun is completely blurred out so this is literally the only thing that we can can base our guests on community center and the could it be this road does it line up well i guess it does line up right to the little angle and the turn right i think it lines up i think it lines up just there is no community center here so there is like a street here there is a street here there is is this count as a street there is like a like a neath street and almost the opposite not exactly opposite but almost the opposite there is yeah not really a street some sort of a road with a house there i think this is where we are i think this is where we are there's no community center here though but i don't know this this is my best guess that we are on roxburgh street let's let's guess there five meters away yes okay okay 5k 5k good start okay what's with the car we look is this brazil very red soil nothing nothing with on the car that really helps us says that this is generation four but the the super red soil wouldn't make me think that we are in brazil so where were we focusing on oi what's this oh this yeah this is portuguese so this is definitely brazil then where is the city name oy oy no way oi is the the city name i guess attend is the city name right like oy inattend i'm thinking that's what oyatenda means oi office in a tender so a tender is the city name i think it should be it so attend so very red soil usually you get a very red soil in kind of like southern part of brazil are there any like phone phone codes maybe phone numbers phone numbers can be helpful in brazil there's a phone number but there is no like that that prefix 99 something something a phone number would be super helpful here if we can find like a phone number with those those numbers in brackets in front that would be very helpful this is literally like looking like for for a needle in a haystack looking for a small small town in freaking brazil also this doesn't look like like a super small village this looks like a like an actual city a small city so shouldn't be too tiny i think i hope i hope the attendant is actually the name of this place but that would be dumb if it isn't there are a lot of a lot of places beginning beginning with an a but i haven't seen atenda yet i wonder if attend is even the main place uh the name of the place maybe the actual clue is somewhere in this i don't speak portuguese though so i i think this must be it right i think it must be it i just i just cannot find a tender anywhere i i feel like i will just have to plonk it somewhere and move on and take the loss here and unless unless i find it in the next few minutes yeah i cannot find it guys i cannot find it i think i need to take a loss on this one which is unfortunate but brazil is such a huge country and without any additional clues like like area codes and stuff like that yeah i think it might be somewhere here maybe but but let's let's have a look okay where was it it wasn't even dorados okay so it wasn't even called freaking attend where was dorados then where was dorados was it on this this sign where did it say dorados okay apparently there is dorados on this boss but like according to the map's description we should have been facing the the city name so there is absolutely no mention of dorados here so this must have been a faulty location in my book that's a faulty location i i would say but still like i was at least i was correct that it is like southern part of brazil so we still got a decent chunk of points but i definitely did not like that location uh parker castell bran castelol or bran might be might be the location named braun another brand so i'm guessing we are in braun let's look around we have an antenna we have blue strips on both sides is this we have yellow plates as well we have holy poles this is romania yeah yeah but dot ro as well yo what the i'm guessing there are a lot of tourists with different plates because this plate has double blue this plate is yellow there are some completely white plates as well so in some places so yeah okay a lot of tourists in romania so if there are a lot of tourists i'm hoping this might be a big city or at least a findable city bran i'm assuming puran is the city here because it is in uh two different we see bran in two different places run okay we don't see bran from this zoom far away so maybe let's let's try to zoom in a little bit more no brown oh i found it i found it okay it's very small but it was visible from pretty far away okay good good good so this is bran good so castello well this does look like some sort of a castle right castello yeah i did say castell here castell bran uh okay so this road is in the north ish parking is to our west where is the parking here do we see parking ground castle parking here and yeah the road the road fits good uh this is like the hotel i'm guessing any any signs with the name lost something i mean it must be villa bran it does look like a pretty big villa there's another house though which isn't there oh it must be here i believe right the road goes to the to the yeah the road goes there there is another road i think we must be here yeah so uh i think we're like here i think we're like kind of like here two meters i will take it two meters away okay after the previous round this feels amazing okay we have yellow a yellow plate we have an antenna western halter blue plate is this the netherlands i think this should be with blue blades and yellow plates this should be the netherlands this should be the netherlands this looks like like a bus station it must be it must be like the city so oh okay it's a big city okay found it immediately good uh i mean it must be at least quite central right if it's like like a bus bus terminal [Music] i don't know how it will be displayed on the map um oh that's a hospital but oh no that's or is this is this a could this be train station this this looks like a bus terminal [Music] could this be a train station behind this this maybe there are trains behind there i don't know what do we have what do we have we have a starbucks we have starbucks nearby well we have the the the toilet thing to our south there is starbucks here so i guess we are in like train train station because yeah we have starbucks the station is to our south or southwest which would fit where is the the street there's like a roundabout here do we have a roundabout we don't we don't have a roundabout here huh well that sucks um mexican mexican huh i mean there are even these things i mean it must be here there are even these like boss thingies on the map visible maybe the roundabout was built recently i don't know maybe it's not on the map because of that hm it must be here right we have starbucks we have the the station we don't have roundabout we don't have mexi cam those are what is this a and b armbro we do have a and b ambro ambro as well we are 100 here the road is a little bit wild there kind of here right kind of in in the middle of all of these thingies so yeah it should be yeah we should be here six meters away i'll take it yeah i guess i guess the roundabout isn't on the map but luckily luckily it didn't didn't cause many problems so last round last round iban mik which one of these words is the city name well not batista national national mission de colinas i think colina is the city name right colleen has something national baptist mission so colina i think will be the city name we have generation four i think this is brazil again isn't it yeah we have brazilian poles and also in this map we have brazil in the center so lovely and of course we don't have any phone numbers again because why would we why would we get any phone numbers that would help us even if there are phone numbers i cannot read them oh lovely just lovely oh okay there are some phone numbers here but those are not the the area codes are they colina what if egregia is the city name not colinas wait oh my god holiness oh my god i so hope this is the one i was just about to start looking for both igraya and colinas i so hope this is it um so what do we have we have some christina something this looks like a very small uh small road ebon mick eben mike the road is kind of like that and this is was this like oh this is not a dead end where is this a dead end no there there is another street going there right but this is like the last street there is no more roads to our north uh what the street ends to our north west so that's a clue and this is a very small road even though this isn't a very big city this is a very small road and we have no idea what's the name of this road we only have like ebon mick which is like a baptist national mission we have we have walt in here and we have christina cabell they might not even be on the map so well something a batista no but this bit it's a pizzeria pizzeria pizzeria i need to look for like like where this like a street ends our like east or west northwest as the street ends there and the road goes like diagonally from from southwest uh southeast to northwest restaurant i think oh without knowing it says that that that i wouldn't know it but where was it here okay perfect whiskey rock something something well i don't know about that there might be a new vault in here we have vault and near here yes okay good i guess that this must be a new bar somewhere here i guess of course the baptist mission isn't on the map as i suspected or maybe the bar is in place of the baptist mission now well we are definitely somewhere here so this is the last house one one house over is this second house a very narrow house though i don't know which one of these are the this narrow house well there's like like a gap between houses now there is like a gap here yeah we are right right next to the gap so so i'm guessing this this narrow one might be the missionary mission or this one so we are kind of here i think and it is one meter away it is one meter away let's go i am very happy with this all in all i think i did very well uh this second location kind of screwed us over because we were not facing the name of the city as we should have been but still 23.8 000 points very very good how did you do let me know in the comments below huge thanks to all the members for supporting this

"in this video we will play some geogaser play along challenges trying to find where in the world are these mcdonald's restaurants you can play along by clicking the links in the description just make sure to play them before watching this video and you can play along even without the pro version so keep that in mind let's see so this is mac express a small one a very small mcdonald's with some some places to sit outside this is i'm guessing france looking at the flag uh we have some palm trees we have some palm trees so and we have a tram um i don't know which cities in france have a tram but usually if you see a tram then usually it indicates like a larger city usually small cities do not have trams june fest i cannot read like any city names i don't think i have a fedex andre this is like a south big supposedly big southern french city um like marseille maybe i don't know if marseille has uh uh trams or not um so blurred out i cannot read it i'm looking maybe maybe something says marseille or or something else but um not really not really this is like a city center city center with these like uh fountains and and this beautiful building rue de la luch no chance we find it but uh we can look for a mcdonald's we have a burger king in the city center sepia oh my god so many restaurants starbucks starbucks i haven't seen a single mcdonald's yet what the hell what the hell oh mcdonald's stakeouts oh you don't know sticker i don't think this is it i don't think this is it i'm pretty sure it isn't but uh i haven't seen any other mcdonald's here might be a different city might not be marseille montepelier maybe maybe are these trump tracks mcdonald's takeout it also isn't it but are these [ __ ] tracks i think these actually might be are they i think they might be [ __ ] tracks so okay let's let's let's maybe try to find some different mcdonald's in in this city i don't see any other mcdonald's i think we might need to go with that one which doesn't really line up with our location but at least it's it is in mcdonald's right burger king kfc oh mcdonald's hello does that work i don't think that works we are like on like a corner here do like a big uh square like a historical building but this one doesn't work either where was our one oh yeah our one is this one is more central um i mean what was the name of the street rule de la luge or something like that yeah doesn't work doesn't work but okay uh let's let's just let's just guess it here and see it actually was the city it actually was the city we found the right city oh yeah here is mcdonald's it's it's so you really need to zoom in like as you can see there is nothing here you really need to zoom in even more to find that mcdonald's there no chance we would have found it crazy uh rue de la lodge actually yeah well well i'm very happy with our guess though only two lost two points let's go oh this is unofficial drc vista honduras okay okay could this be honduras maybe like where's the mcdonald's here is that mcdonald's mac cafe mac cafe okay let's see i'm guessing this might be the capital probably that that would be my guess um still a pretty large capital oh dear lord oh dear lord um mac cafe so we cannot trust compass and since this isn't um official coverage we can't trust compass which complicates things that complicates thing um it doesn't look like we are very central okay let's let's scan over let's see if we can find like mac cafe somewhere mcdonald's or mac cafe or something oh hello mcdonald's mccafe i literally just zoomed in somewhere is could this be it i mean there are lots of like roads around like some some um what do you call them like overpasses i guess was that the word like some some uh burns and then and curves and could i think this is it i think this actually is it what literally zoomed in somewhere is this actually it i don't know is there a k i have i don't see any signs towards the kfc could this maybe maybe a kfc sign supposedly there's like a kfc there in the same building but like looking at the roads i think they line up though we have like this road coming out here but let me pin this we have this road we have this road like going there like road straight ahead we have like an overpass here i think this is it i think we are like here nice oh my god how lucky did i get that's insane i literally zoomed in somewhere in the city and instantly saw mcdonald's and and my cafe okay um let's hope i get as lucky again that pt okay this is portugal well we also get portuguese plates so that wouldn't be that difficult porto okay it says porto porto is a city in portugal oh it also says porto here and it says okay it says porto everywhere so um it should be porto so we know the city this is official coverage so we can't trust compass uh so this is the mcdonald's mac drive [Music] i don't know how you say it in english but he was like a portuguese explorer portuguese spanish explorer i think um so porto and like uh avenue of of megalane or or however you pronounce it so this should be 5k able with enough time we definitely uh should be able to 5k this let's see if i can find like this is like a big church we have a church here we have a church and mcdonald's and like pharmacy and a petrol station everything you need in life everything you might need right here on this corner um okay so church and mcdonald's basically like a megalodon avenue should be i i would imagine it isn't like very small i would imagine it's like a decently sized street so we could maybe look for that as well julio san paolo um hmm this might take a while but i am committed to finding this i haven't seen a single mcdonald's yet but i mean this is most certainly porto we have a burger king i guess yeah we don't need to be zoomed in okay we have mcdonald's here of the new no wrong street names that's not the one was also an explorer so maybe maybe magellan is somewhere nearby pizza hut burger king mcdonald's no way oh my god no way i found a mcdonald's which is although but it says that this is the like street not avenue on the map here it says avenue here it says like uh like or whatever i think in portuguese it was rua right but i mean it it has to be it right it has to be it but okay let's look around does it kind of line up so i guess this is not the road this is like the the not the right road we need avenue what is tv we have uh like road we have tv you need avenue yeah the the roads do not line up like the road directions at all do not line up we would need to be go go like we're like almost almost from south to north [Music] oh my freaking god i found it i found the avenue not the mcdonald's yet but okay i finally found it i was looking for streets relatively large streets that align in this direction i guess i should have should have done it earlier on should have but oh well at least i finally okay mcdonald's church oh my god i think i finally found it um okay so we have mcdonald's here we're basically on the very corner here um i think it works out yeah there's like a repsol petrol station as well yeah we are 100 here five meters away that took way longer than necessary italy italian plates uh i'm like oh god this is such a bad place there are no clues beyond italy oh god i've had such such a sitting such an amazing run up until now and then absolutely no clues here absolutely no clues just that it's italy stronger we have like a pretty big like a road like well i don't know how big it is but we have like a highway going north to south here that's that's our clue espec doesn't help doesn't help oh some random this isn't even a city it's just like a random mcdonald's next to a highway this isn't even a city i feel like this made like kind of like central italy uh we have like a highway going north to south yeah okay i have no clue let's plonk it somewhere near rome let's block it somewhere near rome any any mcdonald's here at least i want to plant it on a mcdonald's here we have a mcdonald's definitely not the one but at least it's some mcdonald's all the way up here oh my god you really need to zoom in so much for this one i would have never found it i would have never found it still i mean lost only 500 points definitely could be worse okay what is this the author is priyank m unofficial coverage clearly a marquette marketplace marketplace so an english-speaking country mcdonald's 24 hour is working looks like an uh a cold place well american style um license plates well not not being europe this isn't europe um pretty high mountains i'm thinking maybe like british columbia or something look this quality is so bad you can't read anything the royal plate the royal something well it being royal would confirm maybe it'd possibly be in canada in canada you see a lot of like royal places um [Music] yeah uh let's let's guess somewhere in uh british columbia since there really isn't much to to base our gas on quality is very bad i don't know the plates again my my lack of plate knowledge bites me but um i don't know these mountains when i see mountains so high with an english-speaking country i am thinking of uh um british columbia let's try to find like a mcdonald's somewhere here in one of these towns i don't know how easy it might be to find a mcdonald's somewhere here maybe maybe you need to like look for a little a little bit of a bigger town a little wet in no mcdonald's no mcdonald's okay we're here no mcdonald's boston flats no mcdonald's oh i don't this isn't funko whistler mcdonald's hello um well this isn't it i highly doubt it but um yeah let's just leave it there and and hope for the best no way actually what no way i get i guess this side fits more but i i just plonked it thinking no chance it is it this might have been the luckiest game of my life honestly so many lucky plonks well i i couldn't find that italy one because that was just too too too crazy but oh my god this is literally one of one of my best games of my life two videos i think you might enjoy will appear on the right side of your screen huge thanks to all the members for supporting this channel if

beautiful locations from all over the world and i will be doing it as a challenge so you guys can play along the links will be in the description and you do not need to have a pro con to play along just make sure you uh play it before watching this video so i don't spoil it a disclaimer i am very bad at this map it's very beautiful but i am terrible at it so do not expect a good score by me but do expect some beautiful scenery this is insanely beautiful we have some houses maybe we can use these houses to like get some some architecture vibes also in these photospheres you can always have a look at the author's name this time it is santi sp doesn't help this time but sometimes like you can see like maybe a domain name there or maybe the name like gives you gives gives away the country somehow um not this time though looking at these houses as you guys know i'm not the best at architecture as well but i'm like feeling either like south southern europe or maybe like turkish vibes that area possibly maybe greece maybe turkey so that that would be my yes here also you cannot trust compass in these uh photospheres in any coverage that it's that is not official you cannot trust the compass because you don't know if the author aligned the curse photospheres correctly or not sometimes they do sometimes they don't you just do not know let's go i don't know let's go with turkey some coastal turkey maybe maybe greece okay never mind never mind it was canary islands not very good not a good start not a good start oh wow what is this what uh taken by kostov ken okay what is this this is like uh like like like a skiing uh resort all year round it looks like this guy has like some skis are they skiing on a grass somehow i don't know i'm confused but it looks very cool it definitely looks very cool it's a long climb up though so many stairs where is this though i've never seen anything like this before let's have a look what do we have around hofbar um which side are we driving on we're driving on the right side so okay that eliminates a few countries we have we have a bunch of like wind wind generators power generators and this looks like a very flat country i see no mountains in the distance what i don't know about wind generators is that supposedly denmark has a lot of them and since this country seems quite flat maybe it's denmark maybe um this definitely feels european getting european vibes from like the houses and everything so i think i think denmark is a good shout no idea where in denmark if it even is denmark i mean it seems like a relatively large city right with this this construction it must be our house maybe maybe is there is there like a land in the distance there is land in the distance so it might be like this this this part or something okay it was denmark it was just copenhagen okay maybe i just should have blocked it in the capital but still i am happy that i got denmark here very happy about uh getting the correct country so dj veg is the author of this image okay we have a baseball stadium which basically indicates that we are in north america in europe baseball isn't really that popular we have some football football fields as well and more baseball spade stadiums and american football field too oh no this is a regular football field a bunch of tennis courts uh i do not recognize i don't know any american football teams that doesn't help maybe some american football fans immediately immediately know where that is from where that team is from i don't i just know that this is somewhere in probably the usa this might be like a town hall or something looks like an old old building um yeah i i don't see anything that i recognize unfortunately well there is an american flag that i just noticed so we know it's not canada at least at least we know it's not canada um the trees well there are no palm trees so i guess this won't be like florida or something very southern um and it does look like look like this is coastal possibly it look it looks like this like ghost goes into the ocean small islands um which coast i don't know i'm guessing east coast i'm guessing east coast um this is new york boston maybe could this be boston we have like a river going through the city in boston there are some small islands here could this be the river going through the city there is there is like a pretty small river this isn't the big river so this might could this be it could we be like here what do we see here station butler station milton playground i don't see any uh like uh stadiums around so it's this is probably not it probably not it maybe like some something somewhere here um [Music] auditorium tennis courts wait we did have some tennis courts here is this actually boston we do have some some tennis courts hmm i think this is our best shot i think this is our best shot let's plonk it somewhere around here not bad okay i didn't get 5k but not bad like uh taking into account how bad i am at the us locations this was a com very lucky of me to go boston i just knew it was coastal it wasn't new york it was a big city so and it wasn't too southern so i don't know boston made sense next round let's go okay uh gotta wait for a second for to load mitrim the mali uh malishev mitrim alicia well looking at this church it definitely feels like uh russian like a russian church i don't know the the exact names of religions i'm sorry is it is it like an orthodox church i don't know i'm sorry i don't know um that's a thing i still need to learn um we do not have any blue strips on the plates so this might be russia that is russian but it might be ukrainian maybe i don't know but currently i would guess probably russia from what i have seen here well okay there i see nothing of use anywhere nearby um so i think this is russia and uh but we do have some yellow pipes you just get these yellow like gas pipes a lot in russia so yeah let's go russia you can get them in ukraine though sometimes uh mostly russia with these mountains i think this maybe could be like near krasnoyarsk novo maybe this doesn't seem like a very big city more like a small smaller on a smaller side like a village or something so it might be one of these maybe smaller ones bellow ball i love all i'm not sure how mountainous it is i know it's get get some more mountains down here maybe maybe maybe let's go corner altais a wild guess i i don't have a better one so let's let's guess it was ukraine well yeah i wasn't sure i was thinking it's more likely russia was ukraine this time unfortunately what can you do oh and the last ah the last location is bugged out i can try to refresh the page yeah image might be subject to copyright it has been removed unfortunately so uh that sucks when this happens uh i don't know let's go germany maybe just gotta gotta we gotta make a wild guess and and hope hope for the best it was not germany but it was sweden so we did get some points but uh i can't take any credit for it it was just a lucky clunk but all in all 13 000 points in this map for me personally that's a pretty good achievement let's do another game uh let's uh the challenge link will be in the description just as the first one uh stefan miss oh this is beautiful i am getting maybe african vibes here maybe african vibes again we cannot trust the compass so yeah as you guys know i'm not the best at like landscapes and and like trees and stuff like that we have a road going here we see there are no cars inside so we don't see which side we are driving on there are some signs but it is hard to tell which side like which way they are uh direct like directed um i think we might be driving on the right side based on this sign hmm [Music] interesting so if we are driving on the right side and if this is africa that's a big if then we should be maybe somewhere in the northern part because like these these like southern states southern countries drive on the left side i'm not sure madagascar might be driving in the right side but i i don't think this is madagascar does cameron drive on the right side i think cameroon might be driving on the right side let's go let's go with cameroon i don't have a better guess than that okay it was australia so as i was completely wrong we were not in africa and we were not driving on the right side so i couldn't be more wrong and i only got three points here oh well oh well not not my best round but let's move on let's have a look what do we have this round um we are driving on the right side this time okay and this does feel very european to me like southern europe maybe france maybe trees what are these like ruins ancient ruins could be i don't know could be anywhere i guess um maybe italy i can't really see those signs properly maybe if if i could see that sign closer maybe it would help but not not from this distance and i also can't see those might wait the front plate does look kind of small and we might have blue on both sides so this might actually be italy this might actually be italy because of that i mean italy was one of my guesses so this plate kind of confirms it to me um not very mountainous at all so it's not like the northern part northern part of italy is quite mountainous um i'm not sure about like where are where there are any hills in the in here um [Music] let's maybe guess somewhere like here let's see okay it was italy it was italy it was just more uh more to the like uh southeast but i'll take it i'll take it pretty decent score for me personally hmm very beautiful location very beautiful but i have absolutely no idea where this is taken by victor posnov victor viktor posnov i've seen some other locations taken by him he always takes such beautiful locations beautiful photospheres always taken by him a sight to behold extremely beautiful but where right um i am thinking could this be somewhere like in british columbia maybe we have some pretty high and and icy mountains i don't know i that i think my best guess would be somewhere in these these mountains in british columbia um let's have a look okay no no just wrong it was greenland it was greenland southern part of greenland ah rip rip very beautiful though very beautiful so the fourth location of the um game ours are way too far for me to see anything useful there um i see no flags on the boats lots of construction going on here oh which set are we driving on do we see do we see are you driving on the left side i can't tell oh no it looks like we are driving on the right side based on uh this highway here and looking at these uh trucks big trucks they look like european style european style trucks have like a flat front the american style trucks will have like like a card curved front so these trucks do seem that like they have the flat front so uh i am thinking europe because of that where where in europe we have a very large river here very large river um which might probably like in one of the direction it probably like enters the c so my guess that is that we are close to a c um the trees don't feel super like uh tropical nuts doesn't don't feel solid uh they don't feel southern so i don't know maybe we could be but that's my best guess here okay not too bad actually it was a big river that is uh entering a sea or is it a canal mid i think mir i don't know well either way we are 320 kilometers away i'll take it i'm happy with that and the fifth round of the game luckily this time it is a proper photo sphere not not like a removed one as we had in the previous game we are driving the right side with this rectangular sign you get these rectangular signs in americas what i find interesting is that we have white central line you get white central lines usually in chile you can't get them in other countries sometimes but usually in chile so and we do have uh like big water like a large body of water in one direction which beats with chile right so i think chile is a good shout i think chile is a very good shot here um looking at the nature they are also pretty mountainous it's with chile looking at the nature i would say i would say it's south of santiago maybe like somewhere here maybe even more to the south although maybe not [Music] i don't know was this this the pine tree that i'm thinking of there is like this pine tree that was like i think in these mountains somewhere around here there was this pine tree maybe here let's go a bit more south like here and guess and hope for the best this was a very good guess 71 kilometers away so uh the correct location is up here but still i am very happy with this guess only 71 kilometers away i will take it again 13 000 very similar to my uh the first game that i had very i'm very happy with this very happy with this okay let's do another one let's do the third one again link in the description um [Music] i don't know if that's correct but all that feels kind of like a nordic like name and this i think that it has that a with like a circle on it if i remember correctly that a with a circle on it was in uh was it in swedish i think it was in norwegian for four was it in swedish too but looking like this i guess it could be both sweden or norway it's definitely up there definitely up there one of the nordic countries let's go let's go somewhere where shall we go sweden i guess we can have a look at the letters on on google maps right i'm not sure if oh apparently yeah sweden does have that a letter within uh with a circle we can see it here so sweden does have so let's go sweden then because i think like looking at a map it looks like sweden has more like these kind of kind of i don't know how to describe them like like curvy curvy lakes and then and the rivers and stuff city has so many lakes and and islands so let's go somewhere here in sweden i don't know hopefully that's close it was norway it was norway well i was between those two i was between those two um but still not too bad 450 kilometers away uh juan carlos oppa is the author of this one uh he might be one of these two uh gentlemen so a nice location uh a name juan carlos would uh maybe indicate that this is a spanish-speaking country since it is a spanish name not necessarily but it might be uh might be a clue we don't see any license plates so we don't know how they look like here yeah i i don't know the trees i'm not very good at trees recognizing trees so that that's not nice could this be mexico could it be mexico like a mountainous part of mexico maybe a guy fishing oh a doggo and a lady uh watching the guy fishing i mean maybe i guess this could be could be america like i mean the usa has a pretty big large spanish population right spanish-speaking population this might be actually usa now that i think about it this kind of does feel like it might be the usa let's let's go to the usa maybe um where in the usa maybe like colorado idaho i don't know let's go colorado oh never mind it was chile again very close to that location we had before ah yeah this time i did not recognize it like a chile did come to my mind but i don't know felt something felt off i thought america is is a better guess oh what is this i might have had i might have seen this location before or have i or maybe not maybe it was a similar one maybe it was a similar one no i think it is the one that i remember there was i think there was like a like some like um entertainment park or something in this this large building or if i remember correctly if that's the one that i'm thinking of these are some i think like all all the power plants or something i think and if i remember remember it correctly if i remember it correctly i think it was in germany i think it was in germany i have no idea where i do not remember where i'm not even sure if it was germany um yeah let's go kind of like this part maybe it was not germany okay never mind it was ukraine oh it was chernobyl ah it was chernobyl okay so obviously it wasn't that location i was thinking of it it looked so similar to the one i was thinking of if anyone in the comments know which location i'm thinking of please let me know damn i usually do recognize certain a bit it's got it's kinda kinda hurts me hurts my feelings that i didn't recognize it this time that sucks that sucks but oh well now i'm wondering now i'm wondering what was that place that i was thinking of because it was so similar also with like like some big towers and like an old like a big big like a warehouse looking looking thing hmm could this be maldives like the the no i think it's too mountainous for maldives i think maldives maldives i think maldives don't have like these heels like this do we have any any flags nope no flags on the boats i'm pretty sure i've had this location on my one of my streams uh on twitch link in the description but my memory isn't isn't that good my memory is pretty terrible uh i just remember that i've had this location i have no idea where it was it was either europe or asia i think pandelini asia maybe like indonesia island indonesia maybe like solomon islands usually when i don't know where to guess i guess somewhere around solomon islands let's get solomon islands what the hell okay never mind never mind it was brazil so yeah my memory is letting me down as always as always not doing very well in this this seed and this is the author oh i didn't check the author on that one i think this one is norbert zalhoffer the name look it sounds kind of german maybe sal hoffa sal hoffa the houses could be german could be like could this be maybe like uh luxembourg maybe this yellow house kind of feels maybe maybe it could be from luxembourg small like river a bigger river some hills not too large factories as well i'm kind of thinking germany i am thinking germany because of the uh author's name and because of that building i am thinking maybe this is somewhere near luxembourg this this like style of building kinda uh reminds me of uh neuschwanstein castle which is in the southern part of germany so maybe let's go like near tupingan kind of in the middle between uh luxembourg and neuschwanstein which is somewhere down here let's get there and hope for the best it was not the germany it was not germany it was is it slovakia i know it was austria right on the border ah okay i mean it makes sense the german name makes sense the author was probably austrian i thought i thought it was germany but oh well still a decent score neeson score what what's my total result 9500 the lowest one of the three how did you guys do leave it in the comments below two other videos i think you might enjoy will appear on the right side of the video huge

back to another geographer play-along video where you will be able to play the same map that i do i will leave the challenge links in the description this time uh i will play city centers basically cities with one million population at least are in this map one location per city we will play this map a few times see how i do see how you do leave it in the comments below later did you beat me did you not beat me uh so let's go so challenge let's do 90 seconds so minute 30 no moving so uh let's go let's go let's see so again city centers with one million population i think there are both official and unofficial coverages here this one is official um so main street los angeles police department okay that's a good clue that's a good clue main street los angeles can we find a main street in los angeles what not mexico no no not mexico main street in los angeles you would think main street is pretty big right you would think that it should be easy to find a main street in los angeles but uh i somehow doubt it oh no let's plug it somewhere main street main street so many streets no main street east east first street mean this is literally the very city center right i don't see the main street though once we find the main street we can start looking for the police department but okay i don't think i'll be able to find the main street guys 14 seconds remaining wait south main street whoa whoa military academy is is it the same is it south main street a part of the main street or no no north oh no it was north it was north main street where is public restroom lapd headquarters yeah well we found north street but uh we went with south north street not the north north street uh north main street sorry yeah anyways next round but at least i got the cd right right oakland wait where was oakland oh god oh hello uh floyd mr floyd oakland was oakland but where was oakland no america never has i'm not an american guys i don't know where oakland is oh god i should probably just learn some some of the like american cities right where where they are i don't know where oakland is oh god damn it oh god damn it um i'm not an american oh oakland where is oakland no orlando oh no oh no 22 seconds remaining sacramento las vegas phoenix albuquerque oklahoma city link called omaha no that's omaha overland oh my god san francisco oakland oh so oakland is part of san francisco then i didn't know that okay i'm sorry i didn't know that okay um yeah let me know in the comments if you knew it after that terrible round let's move on let's pretend that one never happened um okay this looks turkish izmir well i know where is mir is okay where is this mir here is this mirror right uh izmir easier to find in oakland okay um is mere are there any like landmarks or something that i could use to to find where it is so a big pretty big round about it some seems like some mountains to the south so do we see any do we notice any big roundabouts this one is a pretty big roundabout um so we are kind of in the southern part of roundabout does this roundabout fit maybe not really not really if do we see any other roundabouts this one oh no this is definitely not that one any other roundabouts that are pretty big not many roundabouts in this mirror it seems oh this is a pretty big one oh i think yeah i think this is it i think this is it actually i think this one fits better there is some some statue or something in the middle as well dramvay i don't see any trams there but let's go hey let's go five meters away five meters away in izmir let's go let's go that was a good what is this so when you get these photo spheres first thing you want to look at is the author name author's name because sometimes it says the location where it is so this is patrick karanghwa so this time it doesn't really help us what the hell is this coverage well i'm guessing there this is from a country which doesn't have any official coverage i'm guessing and again cities with a population of at least 1 million so this is a pretty big city really big city i can't read what it says at all at all people seem to have a black skin color so i'm guessing it is somewhere in africa possibly driving on the right side which would indicate we are more towards like the northern part of africa um pretty mountainous driving on which side wait oh we're driving on the right side yeah um again pretty big roundabout but if you don't know the country there is no point in looking for roundabouts right um i i don't know which country to guess cameroon maybe like the the yonde or dwala i don't know which which city is bigger oh it was rwanda okay rwanda well [Music] jawanda would have been a little bit closer but they are still pretty far away eh so queson city where was cuisine city i definitely have seen cuisine city before aquazon city i have a feeling it was somewhere hmm oh here oh yeah yeah here it is here it is here it is okay um queson city uh any any other district of sixth congressional district are there any numbers here which is sixth congressional district maybe i don't see any sixth districts with project eight no but i don't see any district six here um any any other clues maybe some um pretty big road counselor merry christmas merry christmas and joyful new year everyone merry christmas yeah well somewhere in quezon city the junction maybe this one i don't know jolly bee wait did we have a jolly be here wait it's a jolly bee wait where was jolie bee what are we actually here are we actually this i just found a random t d like this t shape uh intersection okay that was a little bit lucky okay that was a little bit lucky but uh six meters away okay i mean i'll take it some two of the runs were just terrible but uh i'm really proud of the the uh the other like the third and the fifth round okay uh what was my high score 16 254 again leave it in the comments how did you do let's play this map uh for the second time i guess i'll play it three times i guess again one minute 30 no moving challenge link in the description okay i was thinking like it won't load um okay we have some arabic here a blue strips okay some some leather balls or or half holy poles or whatever you call them so that doesn't really help doesn't really help like iraq or something this is clearly unofficial coverage there might be like a cd name or something in arabic but i can't read it can't read it there is no english at all here probably not a very touristy place um [Music] people do we see people i don't know okay let's let's go like iraq or something baghdad baghdad must have at least million people in living there right um i don't have a better guess okay so it was iran it was karaj karaj well not too bad not too bad 2900 points i'll take it we have the wrong country unfortunately but uh still pretty okay so this is official coverage this is official coverage oh which country had this plate i'm not the best at plates wait what is that stop sign very bad looking stop sign oh no but the sun [Music] is above us nice sun is directly above us stops and does it say para does used to it say i don't know um i'm guessing this is somewhere in south america um the car is kinda like white-ish is this mexico maybe 23 seconds oh rip i don't really know i don't really know honestly i don't really know let's go mexico this isn't mexico city though guadalajara let's go guadalajara i don't know it might maybe it says alto i think it might be an o in the end okay it was alto it was tijuana well at least i got the country right so i'm happy with that but um i'm not sure how i could have gotten that it was tijuana there anyways next round again official coverage here definitely feels southeast asian um could this be indonesia maybe do we see any any license plate what is this uh the hell is that i think it looks like a latin's okay yeah it is a latin script uh indonesian or malaysian i do i cannot tell those two apart but since i was thinking it might be indonesia so i guess i will go with indonesia then um oh yeah yeah these these uh like hats are more common in indonesia um which city uh don't know about that english is a pretty big country let's go bandung might be i don't know might be any of these cities yeah it was this one it was pal-em oh my god i guess 500 kilometers away eh again average but at least the right country at least uh another official one um another official one no car visible where is the sun the sun is setting lovely well this is uh this is latin america of course right of course that electricity counter feels like mexico maybe could this be mexico again those electricity counters do feel mexican but well i guess let's go mexico then let's go mexico then i know these these uh treeless hills i don't know where exactly they are i mean it seems like there are some hills here so let's maybe i don't know if this city has let's go monterrey i don't know if this city has million population that might not have maybe monterrey has one million well it should have right and there are some mountains around so oh it was chihuahua i didn't know chihuahua has a million population damn damn didn't know that didn't know that again 3 000 points eh average so the author is pra prashant chauhan sorry sorry for my pronunciation there okay this script is this india maybe uh surrey enterprises tax include i don't know how indian license plates look like to be honest ominous wettest range well we have both english and and uh this is bengali or or i don't know the proper name of the language um dot oh there is a there is a like a website but you don't see the domain name is it a dot in or not well definitely if it isn't india itself it must be somewhere around india definitely like the whole language and the the people that clothing everything just just feels like that area and let's let's go i can't see the domain in there let's go india the time is running out i mean in india there are very many cities with like million population so let's go with nagpur in the middle basically in the middle of india let's see if it actually is it said ta i just noticed it said ta on this does it maybe mean which city we are in i don't know d a no i guess it doesn't well it was india again very average score um it was northern india would i have known that i don't know maybe if i if i could read what it said maybe well this time lower score twelve thousand three hundred um but all in all i think i did okay i mean i got the countries four times out of five but but uh yeah put average scores in all of them basically and let's play it for the third time um and see how we do again link in the description and make sure to play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything of course i didn't mention it before but i feel like it is uh obvious um what does it say miss no it's not mrs is that ca it's not mississippi me uh proud local support missy sausage what does it say well it doesn't say sausage i assume that much unless there's like a location kind of called missy sausage which would be funny [Music] well we have a flag as well join the movement missy sausage i don't know what does it say do i maybe see some large cities that start with an m monreal it's not monreal it doesn't say monreal there winnipeg edmonton calgary vancouver well it might not even be a city name i don't know oh god i don't know the license plates so they don't help me at all i don't know north american license plates at all city center which city which city well i mean let's go monorail since that starts with an m toronto oh here is missy oh totally didn't see that missy of course of course of course i mean yeah i mean now that i know it is there yeah yeah i see it now i see it now how did i miss it i i always miss cities as you know if you if you watch my videos you always you definitely know that i miss cities all the time um well this is of course kenya because of the car right um how many cities with in kenya with official coverage would have one million population um so kenya so nairobi for foreign probably as well we have some palm trees so i am leaning mombasa here lots of palm trees yeah let's go mombasa should be mombasa then uh near the water i don't think any of the other other other the other cities seem quite small near water mombasa mombasa should have one million though i think i think let's go somewhere here maybe up can we find like maybe land some landmarks or something like a tt t junction again going uh kinda like that maybe one of these intersections although this is a pretty large this one made no but it's not a tea i don't think so i don't think so oh it was this one oh i have i mixed up my compost then i mixed up my compost then well still pretty close though pretty close yeah i mixed up my compass that sucks i would have guessed there if i had my compass right oh well but still only lost three points here still i'm really happy with that guess uh generation four uh what's that language no idea oh we have a portuguese license plates that's portuguese then that is portuguese [Music] patriarchal um any city names what does that say pichella pichellara does it's a pichellara um any picholadas on the map porto might be porto might be lisbon of course each a lot maybe there is some pizza lot as visible when you zoom in pichailottas here not that i can see no pitch a lot is there maybe some picholatas in lisbon i hope picholar isn't anything rude um no i don't see any picture letters um palm ball mq what is mq is it like a mountain mountain pombal is that a mountain or probably not a mouth i don't know it was lisbon ah rip just lisbon i was trying to be cheeky and guessing porto does porto even have 1 million population it might not have i assumed it has i think it's a pretty big city maybe it doesn't even have one million so should have gone with lisbon there in hindsight we have that yellow we have multiple uh red plates not yellow plates red plates historical center historic center these plates feel brazilian do we have like city names somewhere maybe princess celebrate if it says porto then it should be like a port so we might be uh like uh this might be a coastal city if it actually says porto might not say porto it might not say porto that's the issue lots of palm trees pretty hilly could it be some power loot it is pretty hilly here could it be some paolo via de genero maybe let's go rio de janeiro let's go rio historic center [Music] there's no chance i'm finding this intersection in time but let's plunk it here or this ah it wasn't it wasn't rio de janeiro it was salvador well it was brazil it was coastal just just the wrong city just the wrong city unfortunately and another official coverage here okay with palm trees lots and lots of palm trees and party so this is south america generation four black sun backs again so this is uh brazil this is brazil again again lots of palm trees um there are some some mountains as well as we can see um well it can be the same city it can't be a salvador again since there's only one location per city i believe so maybe let's go to your designer again and hope for the best um hope it isn't one of the the even more north cities like receive or whatever you say it uh yeah there isn't really anything else to to look at here there's like a roundabout i mean we can try to find a roundabout in in rio this doesn't feel very central whichever city this is doesn't feel very central so i don't know any roundabouts here don't see any roundabouts this here too late anyways uh ah porto alegre of course of course uh rip i mean again average score right country brazil is a huge country i don't see how i could the same distance basically i don't see how i could have known it was porto alegre and not rio or sao paulo for example but all in all 16 000 points i think it's okay if you know any maps that you think might be interesting to do a play along videos for uh let me know in the comments as well huge thanks to all of the members for supporting this channel if you'd like to become a member

doesn't feel like like scandinavia let's play some nmps at games again the link as always will be in the description for all of the games just make sure you play before watching the video so don't spoil any of the locations so let's have a look well this is north america right this is north america definitely feels more canadian to me uh we have a single yellow line in the middle of the roads which is i feel more common in canada does it say stop or array it says stop yeah it definitely says stop um feels quite mountainous maybe not not necessarily bc mountains like not necessarily british colombia um hmm could this be like no these mountains are too high are there many any mountains in manitoba i'm not sure like more like hills like hills mountains winnipeg somewhere here maybe maybe somewhere here like saskatchewan let's go saskatchewan okay okay was it actually british colombia it actually was british colombia ah tried to overthink as always i always liked to overthink those mountains didn't feel high enough for for british columbia but i guess i was wrong but still got like 2400 points i'll take it uh hmm what's that poll stripey what is this google car this is an interesting one i think this might be nigeria i think this might be a nigerian google car that poll is interesting but this definitely feels uh african to me feels african looks like we're drawing on the right side as well so nigeria would make sense [Music] with these trees and everything i'd probably go somewhere more north maybe not that far north maybe let's go somewhere here okay okay okay i'll take it i'll take it 51 kilometers away off of that i feel like that's a good guess i feel like that's a good issue what is this what is this well definitely europe right oh which country though i'm thinking this might be um the netherlands or denmark do we see plates are the plates white i think the plates are white i think the plates are white [Music] is that a bike lane or no oh god could this be belgium maybe might be belgium actually i don't know these these these signs don't really feel super danish i don't know why this one i'm not sure if i've seen the sun in denmark before so i'm thinking maybe maybe belgium maybe this this barn or whatever this is feels super weird like red like this but this doesn't feel like like scandinavia to me at least let's go belgium let's go northern belgium i'm still still feeling it might be denmark maybe you should go denmark here oh i'm torn i'm torn here this is generation two right looks like it i mean both belgium and denmark can have generation two that doesn't help we see no poles let's go belgium okay let's go belgium it was belgium okay nice nice nice oh i'm so happy about this 85 kilometers away it actually was northern belgium just as i guessed got a bit lucky there i'll be honest so what is this what is this uh we are shadow we're driving on yes we have steering wheel on our right side so we're driving on the left left side uh the cars are drying on the left side um we have white back plates which would indicate ireland and also the houses these white houses with great roofs i feel like they are more common in ireland so um where in ireland where in ireland might we be feels feels near coast feels quite coastal i might be wrong about that just just a general vibe that i'm getting where shall we go in ireland well luckily ireland isn't like huge right so even if you guys like the completely wrong side we'll still we'll still get a decent amount of points let's go maybe maybe here somewhere like not super coastal but like a little bit hedging but i feel like it should should be a pretty good guess okay okay i'll take it i'll take it 76 kilometers away and one last one last round in this game um with these bollards this should be australia right australia australia very green a little bit early not really hilly i mean maybe little hills looks like this is coastal which is interesting but is it a lake or is it actually actually an actual coast it doesn't look like a lake it doesn't feel like a lake it feels like an actual coast here to our north oh god where could we be could we be like somewhere here maybe i don't think it's darwin this doesn't feel like darwin to me well not there doesn't feel like darwin to me uh i'm feeling we might be near brisbane or something not necessarily here but i'm assuming that is like the ocean it looks like it might be it doesn't feel like a lake to me these are australian pollards so the country country is clear but yuck australia is pretty big pretty big could it be somewhere no no could it be for philippe bay doesn't feel like okay let's go near brisbane let's go near brisbane and hope for the best ah heartbreak it was tasmania what oh my god yeah i mean whale lookout we had water to our north yeah oh that hurt that hurt basically completely opposite side of australia almost got 1600 points only here uh all in all 18 000 points well in three of the rounds i feel like i did really really well in the other two uh average let's go for the next game again link in the description what is this what is this you're driving on the left side going on the left side those green signs yellow is that yellow i think we have yellow back blade is it yellow i think it is yellow yeah i think it is yellow somewhere in the uk then somewhere in the uk um white house white house feels where does it feel like um somewhere like somewhere in this area i feel we might be i might be wrong but but but i would guess maybe maybe maybe maybe let's let's go shively shivali lovely lovely name it was even more southern i was thinking kind of southern southern england i wasn't thinking that southern though wasn't thinking that southborn uh 100 points there an okay score and okay score again these white houses with gray roofs i'm thinking ireland getting lots of uk and ireland ireland i think this is ireland so yeah with these these gray houses uh like light gray houses gray roofs thinking ireland we're in ireland we might be kind of kind of close to where we were previous time like somewhere here this time it was the very north of ireland so um yeah but still got the country right at least oh this is a this looks tougher this looks tougher this kind of looks like australia but um australia is big we keep getting the same countries which is kind of annoying i think this might be near perth maybe like western australia i feel this might be maybe may that's a big maybe but i if that would be my best guess the road goes quite horizontally so i don't know we might be somewhere here um was the right country but uh was not what was it the border border between south australia and new south wales oof not a good guess 1500 points only there let's have a look well this looks like tunisia at first glance looks very much like tunisia where in tunisia might be no way i can read that sign probably wouldn't have any useful information either way could be anywhere in tune easy as far as i'm concerned let's go massakin maybe or fox let's go masakin oh it was tunis just tunis okay well 4700 points almost decent decent decent guess driving on the left side generation to come again australia oh my god what's with the australia today in so many australias that's such a huge country i'm not the best at it as well so oh rip rip a very good chance to get higher higher score than me if there are any australians playing along who or or anyone else who knows australia better than i do um generation two that poll could that pole be southern australian pole or no hard to tell it might be might be might not be again i don't have a better guess than that unfortunately so let's go south southern south australia somewhere with the road is going kind of like this um where could we be i don't know i don't know let's let's go somewhere baga what does it say bhagat well okay let's go there let's i don't know was it south australia or not okay okay it was it was pretty good a pretty good guess it was south australia indeed so just just uh across the the spencer gulf so but yeah 4 500 points almost 19 000 points in total pretty good better than the previous game better than the previous game so i'm happy with that and the final game of the video let's hope we don't get any more australia's than we already have had well this is the nigerian follow car right this car is following us all over nigeria where is this location though um we have some some interesting like i think that's mosque here um does it help us i don't think it does but um i mean this looks like a relatively big city right or would they have this this grandiose mosque in a small city looks like pretty big mosques so i'm guessing that might be a big city because of that maybe not necessarily like lagos or abuja but but maybe it's like benin city or something maybe actually go benin city let's go benin city and then hope for the best um was was more to the north okay so it actually was quite quite a small city i was thinking it would be bigger abaji okay it was a bhaji central mosque pretty beautiful looked very beautiful what is this what is this [Music] oh god is this australia again are you kidding me or is this new zealand this might be new zealand the sun is to the north well that doesn't help to distinguish the two i'm looking at the poles and the poles feel more new zealand the new zealand dish i don't know um it feels more like new zealand the poles it looks like they are a little bit more wider in the bottom and the narrower at the top so yeah that's what i would say um that's what i would say uh yeah let's go somewhere here maybe near let's go the uh wakyoru let's go wakioru it was southern ireland oh rip rip it was tuatapere next round what do we have what we have uh feels well very middle eastern from the first glance um i'm thinking this might be uae maybe we have those yellow uh sidelines i can't see the plates it's just the houses feel very like fancy very rich expensive i don't think you'd see houses like this very much in israel and jordan i'm sure there are some houses like this but just in the uae you see them way more um let's go uae then also these these like sandy sandy sidelines look very uae-ish um let's go kind of here it's always closer to dubai than i'm that i'm thinking so let's go somewhere here yeah it's always closer well this time it was closer to sharjah but again it's always closer to the city center that i'm that i'm thinking 53 kilometers away i mean decent decent okay what is this what is this um i'm thinking probably malaysia looking like this this the blue sign you see a lot of blue signs like this in like malaysia and then also some there is like there's like some stripy poles also typical uh to malaysia i'm currently thinking is this like the mainland malaysia or is this borneo island um which one is it i'm thinking this actually looks a bit more like borneo it's hard to describe what exactly but feels like it but um yeah feels a bit more like borneo i might be wrong might be wrong um but could it be up here that would be very impressive it if it actually was up there um or near bentulu shall we risk it and go up there near sandakan um the road it would be somewhere here near kenyan gao let's go somewhere near kenyan go let's see if it is actually there oh it was it was actually closer to bintulu but not not that bad not that bad 40 uh 4300 almost okay and one last guess with these uh we see these concrete block roads here concrete block roads with white lines in the middle you get these concrete roads as you probably know already in thailand and the philippines those are the two two countries that have them mostly with white lines in the middle i would say i'm leaning towards the philippines is because in thailand you get a lot of yellow lines in the middle instead of white so yeah i'm thinking the philippines here um philippines is isn't a huge country but but it's quite stretched out with a lot lots of water in between so you can lose a lot of points there shall we go paneer kind of hedge kind of to hedge might as well be penne as far as i'm concerned let's go penae i guess let's let's go with panerai let's hedge it and then let's see i hope it's not actually the thailand i am leaning towards the philippines here so so it was the philippines it was even more to the south okay so i'm glad i didn't go near manila there almost 4 000 points for the last round twenty thousand so slowly slowly increasingly first game was eighteen then nineteen thousand now it's twenty thousand so slowly slowly increasing the score let me know in the comments down below how

and do not get i will donate one dollar to a charity as usual i will be playing three games in a diverse world with no moving and one minute per round if you want to play along i will leave the link in the description to all of all three of the games again no cutting out any footage however poorly i do i will leave it in so let's have a look where we are well this is israel immediately uh yeah this this hebrew confirms it we see some arabic though as well which is interesting which means we might be near palestine possibly or even in palestine uh but yeah now we we see only only yellow plates which would make me think israel and not palestine um we see a lot of trees a lot of greenery and from what i have noticed you usually get a lot of greenery in northern part of israel um i don't know which city this is by any means let's go nasher maybe or nasher i don't know how you sp how you pronounce it let's guess somewhere somewhere there or no maybe maybe a fula let's go a fula let's guess a fool ah it was very close to tel aviv okay fair enough very close to tel aviv uh 4 800 100 points which is quite good good beginning i would say uh good beginning so it was like 17 cents to charity or something for that well this is australia right we're driving on the left side these poles it's very useful to know these poles actually you get these poles in the like southern australia south australia uh i believe only only there with this like like dark sides so that's very useful to know we see a little bit greenery here and there yeah we are doing in the left side indeed um where in south australia might we be looks like we are near like a pretty big road maybe i guess we might be kind of near to adelaide maybe like i don't know somewhere here maybe somewhere there uh let's let's go okay i'll take it i'll take it we were 69 kilometers away pretty pretty good uh all things considered i would say for australia especially 69 kilometers in australia i'll take it any day of the week we have this generation 4 camera with these bollards uh you get these bollards in thai uh thailand and indonesia those are the two countries but the yellow line in the middle driving on the left side yeah in this language of course uh would indicate thailand so this is somewhere in thailand um where in thailand might we be that's the big question we see some hills lots of greenery hmm i'm not the best at thailand i'll tell you that much so this will be quite lock-based um i have a feeling we might be either somewhere here north or we might be somewhere here even but let let's go somewhere north let's go kind of northern thailand uh and and hope for the best okay it was northern thailand nice nice nice 4300 is even super far north even fair enough but i'll take it i'm quite happy with my score there okay this is dominican republic i just finished filming a deep video about this so i will leave the tip video up in the info card which yeah that side up in the info card if you haven't seen the uh new tip video about battle royale uh new locations yeah this is dominican republic in dominican republic we have mountains to our north right we might have like ocean to our south in dominican republic we have coverage only in two cities we have coverage in santiago de los caballeros and santo domingo i don't know where there are mountains are there mountains here or not but i think i'll go santo domingo because i think there might be like ocean to our south possibly maybe do not know about that but yeah let's get somewhere here it was the other city but still these decent amount of points i'll take it lost the coin flip basically okay this is taiwan when you get these uh orange or yellow and black um stripes all the way to the ground you are most likely in taiwan and we see lots of chinese as well all around us san may road does that doesn't help me at all do we see any mountains not really actually not really not really oh there's a road 17 south road 17 can we find road 17 somewhere 17 24 17 oh oh my god that was quick that was i mean it said south so i started from south uh let's go somewhere here maybe i don't know how long road 17 is maybe it goes all the way through through the whole country yeah road 17 let's let's let's leave it somewhere here maybe and then hope for the best hope for the best the last one yeah there there is another road 17. i guess those might be some local roads or maybe the road 17 the road 17 ah yeah the road 17 actually goes through all of the country nice nice well at least i got the country right so so so could have been much worse right let's do the summary we got well i got 23 091 points uh which would uh make it like 1.91 i believe towards charity so let's go let's go uh let's see another challenge again link in the description if you want to try it just play before me so i don't spoil to spoil the locations oh god what is this oh this might be bad honestly this might be bad i am thinking maybe new zealand here can we see the poles this pole though oh god the sun is to the north yeah um i might lose a lot of points here there really isn't much information but from all from these vibes i'm thinking northern ireland of new zealand we get some hills but not like huge mountains or anything so i would guess maybe somewhere up here let's just guess ah completely different got the different country completely rip it was south africa east london damn i did not think it was there honestly yeah as you can see i make mistakes as well i'm not perfect so that's five five dollars towards uh thor's charity so nice okay this feels like south korea right we have this black car uh hard to see the language but it might be korean we cannot see the symbols properly but but very very well might be korean um some hills as well towards northeast uts or north west let's go somewhere like they go no okay i mean it was it was not south korea but but yeah wrong side let's move on let's move on driving on the left side here white lines all white lines we see any bollards yes we do see some australian bullets kalarka alarka kalarka no idea where that is [Music] yeah i really should study those there are videos how to tell apart australian local locations like parts of australia i haven't watched them yet i keep keep postponing it so it would have been really helpful here would have been really helpful here well thinking we might be like somewhere in queensland maybe maybe i really don't know just just a guess okay we were in queensland that was a good guess by me that's 3 700 points almost 3 800. this is south korea again can we get these yellow and blacks the stripes that do not go all the way to the ground uh that indicates that you usually are in south korea so again south korea uh again black car but mountainous again [Music] where shall we guess i think let's guess shall we guess they go again or is it here again let's use again this time okay it was all the way up here okay fair enough well for 4 500 points i will take it is this south korea again what the hell how many south koreas are we getting like i mean it's a small country so i'll take it sure sure i'll take it but yeah again black car these stripes not going all the way down back to the all the way to the ground and these uh yellow sometimes yellow signs you will also see in south korea um shall we guess they go again i don't know or dejean i usually like to guess dejean actually let's guess dejean and it will be daegu now right the one time i don't i guess they go it probably will be there okay no it was actually down here south okay then decent score 4 500 points yeah that one round that one uh south african round really messed me up a lot so we are donating how many uh how many how many dollars here seven dollars and seventy cents for this uh this round okay and let's go for the last uh last game and the challenge in the uh description copy link for sure let's go what is this what is this america or canada neither one both are big countries i don't like it i'm not the best at us and canada oh no oh no i might lose a lot of points here quite green um white green a little bit hilly um could we be like in i don't know missouri illinois somewhere there maybe that would probably be my guess oh not too bad honestly i'm really happy with my guess here 3 300 points that's good for me at least in the u.s these holy poles these holy poles are the uh hungarian um in poland i think the halls are smaller than this kind of getting polish vibes but i think it although maybe maybe this is poland i am getting polish vibes here so i'm kind of leaving poland especially with these these two poles leaning one against the other i feel like it's more common in poland with these holy poles yeah this pole looks very polished with these smaller holes um let's go poland because of that where in poland might we be um not sure let's go kind of uh yeah okay we run out of time but yeah i'm pretty happy with my guess 4 600 points what is this this is israel again getting lots of repeats today uh like getting the same countries again and again like south korea we had like three times israel this is the second time or is it four times south korea um let's see um again quite uh quite a lot of greenery that i see around a little bit hilly these palm trees would make me probably lean maybe against like tel aviv near tel aviv possibly okay seven kilometers away 7.5 kilometers away only 20 points lost there that is a good guess right there oh what is this again again neither america or kinda we have no no front plates no front plates any any clues that we can see we see no flags think it says array on the stop sign you get array in uh like quebec uh let's go let's quebec city maybe quebec city somewhere near quebec city well this is insane city center for sure but i think it may be like like somewhere near quebec city let's go somewhere there hey not bad not bad a little bit further away from the city but i'll take it for canada 65 kilometers very good score i would say um hey you have an antenna oh poland again like again same countries same countries this is a polish sign with this very thin red border yellow sign it's poland it's a polish sign um again i probably won't find any any clues about the city um looking like this looking like this i would guess maybe kind of like like like maybe somewhere here more towards uh southwest in the central southwestern poland maybe maybe that's that's a guess that's a guess um so loading loading and it is more to the center but still like 4 700 points i will take it what's the final score it is uh how much am i how much do i owe 2.40 i got 47 cents if my calculations are correct i need to donate 12 dollars and eight cents let's round it up to 13 let's see which of these lovely lovely charities will get 13 from this video pesticide action network europe is a lovely ngo that promotes sustainable alternatives to pesticides let me know in the comments how you did in the challenges and another similar video will appear on your screen shortly make sure you apply to the monthly giveaway of

i do not get i will donate one dollar to a charity you guys will be able to play along this time so i will leave the links to the challenges in the description one minute per round a diverse world you can play along without the pro account as well just make sure you play it before watching this video and i will not cut out any footage however badly i do i will put it in so we are driving on the left side here where is the sun do we see the sun the sun we have those yellow lines uh yellow lines on the sides uh so that would make me think that this is southern africa looking at these plates i'm thinking i'm thinking south africa [Music] um let's plonk it already just so we if we run out of time at least we have plonked it we don't see we see these like uh rolling hills with lots of trees so i'm thinking we might be near eswatini somewhere i think we might be somewhere around there let's go here maybe maybe a bit risky oh nice that was a good start actually a bit more closer to lesotho but i will take it that's a really good start i would say what is this uh this looks like an australian bollard let's have a look around is it an australian bollard i think it is they are all over the place uh which [ __ ] are even driving on they look a bit weird but i do think they are australian i do think they are australian the sun is to our north as well so that fits um looking like this australia i think this should be somewhere uh down here in victoria somewhere close to victoria at least um maybe like new south wales that's also possible anything we can see on this sign house and land hotendo homes ortondo i'm not sure is hotendo a place maybe well if it is it's probably a very small one there is no point in looking let's go somewhere around there oh more to the north way more to the north it was queensland near brisbane we got the right country but yeah it was not where i expected it to be so oh god what is this i have generation 2 camera oh this is italy these are italian license plates with italian license plate with blue on both sides we see another one right there in the distance these are some mountains italy is quite mountainous there isn't too much information and read the name of the street well it wouldn't help me anyways let's plonk it let's plug into northern italy maybe oh let's go somewhere up here let's let's see if it is it was southern italy epa epa i mean we got the country right again but oh god so this is uh either argentina or uruguay i'm leaning towards argentina so yeah argentina here because these poles in uruguay usually get different poles um do we see the argentinian plates yes these are argentinian license plates as well and these signs are also in argentina looking like this looking like this i would say we might be somewhere around here somewhere in this area maybe a little bit to the south actually somewhere here that that would be my guess here we cannot see uh what where was it we cannot see this like road number or anything so there's no point trying to looking up anything okay not too bad not too bad 186 kilometers that's that's pretty close i would say and the last round here oh god so is this do we see the car the long antennae yeah no strips this is russia this is russia um russia is a big country though so we can lose so many points there so many points if only we were a little bit closer to that sign there must be some large cities on that sign oh god that would really help us but um i would say we might be somewhere like here i don't know i'm feeling like western russia vibes i might be completely wrong here oh we have a flag russian flag as well here just noticed but um maybe a little bit more to the east near here let's see and oh right in the middle that's that's such a bad place how did we do 16 000 points that's not a good score well that's an average score not a good score for me i usually perform better so this is uh i believe 10 8.10 to a charity for this game okay let's move on to the next uh next game second game i will be playing three games i'm not sure i'm not sure if i mentioned that but let's go again link in the description play it before watching my my guesses so this one is quite obvious if you know some meta this is one of the most well known meta the kenyan snorkel this is most certainly kenya um we're in kenya though you guys already know i'm not the best at like pinpointing locations it even says kenya right here in case someone didn't know the meta and this is kenyan follow car as well um ministry of x something penalty i mean if there's a ministry here this should be like the capital right if there is some sort of a ministry here that that's what i would assume there are some mountains here as well mountains towards our south i'll be honest i don't know where there are mountains in kenya there are some mountains here maybe let's go somewhere here so maybe we're looking at those mountains no i mean still we were near nairobi we were near nairobi just the other side if i had gone there to the other side the same distance that would be a really good guess i mean 98 kilometers that's not bad either way then we have some yellow plates immediately some bollards i am thinking this is netherlands feels quite flat as well yeah uh you sometimes get generation two with yellow plates the first start usually is luxembourg but this just feels so flat and the houses feel more dutch to me um again finally we were a bit closer to the sign and we could feed it that would help so much um but still netherlands is not a big country i hope this actually is netherlands not not like zlemberg um again i won't be cutting it out if this actually is luxembourg but this looks super flat this should be netherlands for sure um somewhere here maybe or here oh no up there okay i mean it was netherlands uh 4 700 points that's a that's a good score i would say that's a good score and this is switzerland guys this is the swiss bollard we have the low camera that i keep telling you about again we're in a location that we don't see the the locations there must be like some some city names on this side oh my god where are we getting these locations um okay uh somewhere in switzerland somewhere very very mountainous probably more towards south then because south is more mountainous than north um let's maybe go somewhere here maybe [Music] maybe it's kind of hedging kind of hedging our bets but uh we'll see i mean it should be i mean switzerland isn't very a very huge country either way so we should be okay 103 kilometers okay not too bad not too bad again 4 700 points [Music] what is that language hu hungary hungary hungary is a bigger country so it would be nice to know the city we are in [Music] well at least we know the country right we're not in paris no that that's a hint that we are not in paris for sure um yeah i have no idea which city um budapest is towards our south i can read it there budapest to our south budapest is already very northern this is right like road two or road three i can't see road two it might be road two to our like [ __ ] are we like on walk or something oh no oh we were here oh there's road three then ah i wasn't sure is it road two or is it road three i saw road two right here uh to the to the north of budapest that that's why i was thinking uh maybe it's road too makes sense makes sense it was road three then but okay pretty good still for hungary this is not the but not the worst guess i would say 4600 this game we're doing really well and this is new zealand guys these are new zealand bollards um [Music] why is the streak zero though weird not sure it should be automatically like incrementing when i get correct countries but oh well for whatever reason for whatever reason it was reset there um looking like this i don't see like any super high mountains so i'm inclined to go to the northern ireland in new zealand uh but still it could be southern ireland for four definitely could be um yeah not too much to see here not too much to see let's go southern part of northern ireland somewhere here maybe a bit more to the south just in case it is northern ireland it might be actually just in case it's southern ireland i meant let's see it was northern ireland okay we were right on that one again pretty close pretty close i'm really happy with this score twenty three thousand four hundred and seventy three oh my god how many dollars is that it is one dollar and fifty three cents and let's do the third game let's do the third game um again one minute the link in the description play first if you want to play along oh no is this usr canada very petroleum company that's a us flag right there let's see it's like 60 oh god which which state had these red signs though i don't know which state ah that's the thing i should actually learn because those state like highway signs how they look in each state that's a very useful useful information highway 40. does it did it say 40 it says 60 i think though but this feels quite southern to me um [Music] my my long long time viewers know that i'm bad at us i do not know how u.s looks like how each state looks like so let's let's go somewhere in the middle maybe okay i'm actually not mad at all this is a decent guess for me at least in the u.s 2600 points it was utah i was not expecting for it to be utah to be honest at all oh no why are we getting these huge countries first u.s now russia what's next like brazil will brazil be next we still need brazil and australia for for the full uh full combo uh well this is russia this is russia and russia is a pretty big country pretty big country though um i'm thinking i am thinking kind of towards western russia again well the first time it wasn't western russia though but this time i am thinking western russia kind of maybe somewhere here it is a bit risky in case it isn't but i have a feeling it might be somewhere in this area near the border let's see if my feeling is right i don't know okay wasn't that bad actually i mean we're almost thousand kilometers away but it was kinda near a border yeah not the border i was thinking of but three thousand points i'll take it in russia more than happy uh this is uh this is south africa right this definitely feels like south africa hector oh my god is this south africa it should be right i don't see those yellow signs though but it should be yeah i have no idea where those cities are first time hearing of them looks quite green quite green could it be up here a bit risky it might be down here as well that's a risky one ah let's switch it down here let's switch it down here it was up there oh why did i switch it why did i switch it oh it was such a risky guess i i i i i flinched i flinched uh rip should have stuck with my first guess even though it was quite risky to guess there this is france this is a broken french bullard a very sad sight but this is france out here is here is a uh here is a like a solid bollard that is not broken um again no signs i mean there are some signs but no idea if they if those are some cities they are super tiny cities regardless so where could it be it could be anywhere let's go a pure guess let's go somewhere here let's let's see how we do ah that was northern france could be worse could be worse i have these uh rumble rumble strips here chevron chevron um which state again u.s we keep getting these huge huge countries like come on this definitely feels like southern us though budget budget budget oh uh granddale interset 15. can we find interest at 15 quickly 17 19 10 15 interested 15 oh somewhere here or up here let's let's leave it there let's let's leave it there somewhere here i don't know should be close i think i hope no no i mean not that far but i mean interested 15. i was thinking more to the south that's why i didn't go up there fair enough i i guess it is more green in this area right near los angeles i guess so again i'm not the best at us geography unfortunately so let's view the summary 17 013 points uh how many dollars is that it's seven uh seven dollars and 99 cents so in total i have to donate 17.62 cents let's round it up to 18 let's see which of these lovely charities in our wheel will i donate to this time is what it's the water project again i believe it's the same time same one that was chosen the last time a great charity that supports to the brings water to people in need thank you guys for watching let me know how did you do in these challenges in the comments below thanks to all

playing a few more no moving panning and zooming games which you guys can play along i will leave the links to the challenges in the description you don't need to have a pro account to play along just make sure you play it before watching this video so i don't spoil anything let's go so what do we have here we have these wooden poles immediately i see that we have these yellow backplates right here and white front plates and also i think it's it is english right here so this is united kingdom where in united kingdom though um i'm not the best at the united kingdom locations but i am thinking this might be like northern england maybe or near wales somewhere there maybe i might be completely wrong on this one let's go like nottingham somewhere around nottingham maybe that would be my guess let's see not too bad actually even closer to wales oh nice i'm super proud of getting this one that close actually as i said northern england well not super north but close to wales nice that is really good so the next location what do we have not very not a very good road some lots of holes um i am leaning ukraine right now because in ukraine you oftentimes will get a road like this well this might be russia as well but uh these are not the typical russian poles and russian poles usually have that black strip at the bottom but here i i don't see any strips just to just a plain just plain poles i'm thinking ukraine but where in ukraine might this be uh looks quite flat looks quite quite quite a flat location the road goes um like that the road goes like that in that direction looks like there are some mountains here we are looking like towards like south west southwest we see no mountains i think there are some some hills there maybe we are like up here maybe maybe that that would probably be my guess maybe let's let's choose a smaller road though i don't think it's it's that road because it's too big it might be like this road possibly possibly oh god oh god it was russia oh no oh no okay next rocket next location we we might we might get back in the game still not nothing too crazy we have these road lines the the soil looks quite red immediately i noticed that the soil looks quite red and also we have these black black backs of the sign so this should be brazil immediately i am thinking that where in brazil though if i had to guess you don't see like with this red soil i would say maybe like moto grosso somewhere there somewhere there the road goes kind of horizontally with the turn to the south so maybe let's go let's plonk it around here maybe let's see okay i mean for for a brazilian guess it's not too bad not too bad you can see how how large brazil is so 800 kilometers i'm i'm okay with that okay this is the canyon snorkel this is the canyon snorkel that we have here and also we're driving on the left side which also corresponds to kenya we have some mountains driving east to west and the road turns to our north going east to west kenya i would say it's somewhere like nearby nairobi nearby nairobi where could it be let's guess let's guess here maybe kind kind of fits me possibly i was way way more to the south okay not not my best score here and this is south korea this is the korean language up here korean language up there and also like the overall feel like a autumn coverage or winter coverage you also see this in south korea with the yellow line in the middle as well but the korean language is the biggest clue a city what are those 974 1160. unfortunately the south korean uh map isn't the best but maybe we are able to find pohua we probably won't be able to find it but we can try for for a minute or two don goo but i haven't seen any raw ree we have re draw riri lots of freeze but no rose okay i cannot find pohua raw let's get dejong usually i guess dejong when i don't know where to guess in south korea let's see how good of a guest it is oh it was all the way up here let's zoom in can we see pojobaro no we can't even see pogbaro on the map amazing and the summary 1700 points okay the next challenge hopefully this one goes better than the previous one let's see let's see what is this hmm what is this we see some buildings in the distance oh no we have some quite high mountains some buildings um looking at the trees these trees remind me of france a little bit france or italy france or italy maybe spain these mountains to our south i am leaning italy i'm leaning italy but it might be like france possibly possibly we see some mountains in the distance some mountains in the distance let's guess maybe somewhere somewhere like in southern italy somewhere here it was greece but the the guest wasn't too far off got the wrong country but more than 4 000 points i'm okay with that a decent start okay what do we have here though uh where is the sun do we see any shadows we don't see any any shadows really um sun is quite far up in the sky but it looks like it might be a little bit to the north that's what it looks like to me with this road and sun a little bit to the north and these fences i am thinking we might be in argentina that would be my main guess here this pole also i think i've seen polls like this in argentina before [Music] argentina is a pretty big country pretty big country but could it be somewhere there let's let's go a bit more south somewhere here maybe i'm thinking i'm getting the wrong countries but the guesses are close but i'm getting the wrong countries this is uruguay not argentina yeah not doing super well uh from the first glance uh we see the small plate and the pickup big pickup truck so this feels quite american but the trees feel very weird for america like the trees almost feel like kyrgyzstan ah we have like spanish on the sign name spanish on the sign sun is to our south i'm thinking mexico probably right i'm thinking mexico um we're in mexico i'm thinking quite should be quite close to the american border i feel i feel it would be quite close where where where let's go let's go in chihuahua maybe this road okay nice nice i'm very happy with this guess 22 kilometers away this is a very very awesome guess let's go get in get in a round number four round number four what do we have here we have the yellow line we have some planes um this feels like america which isn't very good for uh nnpz challenges because it's very good to get a good score in america at least for me the sun do not see the sun don't really see sun appears to be very high in the sky it doesn't help us really yeah i'm thinking probably america i'm feeling southern america like maybe maybe texas maybe maybe like louisiana somewhere there new mexico possibly the road the road goes like east to west almost almost with a slight tilt maybe somewhere here maybe maybe we are on this road imagine if it actually is um i mean again for america look how huge america is for america like 400 kilometers off i feel is is decent enough oh god and what the hell is this what is this we have generation two camera we're driving on the left side judging by this sign right here since it's on the left side as if we were driving on on the left side um i am thinking south africa here white line in the middle i'm hard to see any lines on the sides maybe they are faded oh and this this uh i just noticed this uh arrow these arrows are very common in south africa as well again south america we're getting like very big countries in this in this uh challenge so not not very lucky in in terms of that but let's see let's see what can we get here let's see the road the road goes like diagonally i don't see any any big mountains but it is quite green no big mountains to our south west but it is quite like a little bit green not too green so i'm thinking maybe somewhere here maybe even more to the south there seem to be some hills here though this looks very flat um maybe somewhere here this looks uh this looks more flat this looks more flat let's guess somewhere around there look it's it's basically in the middle of south africa so either way that's a good hedge let's see how close how close our guess was not too bad not too bad actually could have gone even more to the north but again 4 300 points on the dot and in total 21 000 i will take it let's go and the final challenge of this video let's see how that one goes oh no what is this oh we have a bollard at least this bollard is in either slovenia austria or montenegro we have some black and white arrows in the distance i think i have seen arrows like that in slovenia i think i might be wrong i think austria had different arrows not sure about montenegro though um yeah my my guess would be slovenia here um looks quite mountainous slovenia can be very mountainous indeed [Music] maybe somewhere here i don't know let's let's get somewhere there oh nice let's go it was closer to ljubljana even i didn't talk i didn't think it was that close to to the capital but 47 kilometers away very good start oh no oh no um okay driving on the left side i think this is australia guys i think this is australia and australia is huge but it looks very green uh but hilly green and hilly would make me think uh somewhere like victoria or something near melbourne that would be my uh my instinct hmm yeah there there really isn't much to see this seems like a pretty big road pretty big road going like from from south south to west to north east with a little turn so there are quite quite a lot of pretty big roads in in australia um no not there i don't know maybe it's somewhere up here but like woodcut oh no but there there is like an intersection there is an intersection to nor to the north there is an intersection to the north so that that does not fit but no no we we almost we almost come from west almost from the west um i'm trying to find like a road that might fit actually maybe somewhere here that would kind of fit there's also a turn a little turn turn in the distance so yeah let's guess diamond creek road 91 kilometers okay this time it was far further from the city still i'm very happy with this guess let's go what a start what a start um we have generation 4 camera here but we have their shopping on nelly shopping on ellie um this feels like this feels like latin america sun appears to be to our north generation 4 camera i am i am thinking argentina here argentina would be mike yes i think let me let me think a little longer yeah the text text on the red text is a little bit too small the red sign to read it it doesn't feel brazilian it's either argentina or brazil i don't think it's brazil it feels more like argentina to me so yeah let's go with argentina where though there are there seem to be some mountains to our west seem to be some mountains there um maybe we are somewhere near these mountains maybe you're like santiago maybe this city let's let's have a look [Music] no probably not that city no it feels like this city like the the roads go directly towards the mountains like we see directly some mountains in the distance might be one of these intersections for all i know shopping on nelly shopping on nelly that might be like the store name or something shopping on nelly let's glance over maybe we we find shopping or nelly in this city by any chance right shopping on nelly yeah i cannot find any shopping on nelly unfortunately um but but i still will guess this city the city feels like like a good guess to me please have some mountains there and and let's see i mean it was argentina we had mountains to our our east our west but it was a different city a smaller city and yeah we have shopping on nelly right there as well oh no oh well i mean not the best score still 2 000 points could be worse oh no this is brazil ah why do we keep getting the big countries the big countries the first two rounds were amazing now now now this uh brazil is a big country oh this is brazil because we have all of these black sign backs and gen 4 camera again um where in brazil though feels quite green white reddish soil i would say pretty red soil um just because of that i would guess like somewhere up here what's the direction of the road kind a little bit like a little bit tilted might be might be somewhere here any any intersections looks like a small intersection to our east might as well be here for all i know although there are some buildings there i don't see any buildings around no buildings around maybe here then maybe no idea but uh i mean i'll hope i hope for the best brazil is a huge country i mean could be worse could be could be better could be worse still 30 3 400 points uh with those huge huge countries pretty good um okay this is europe i don't recognize those bollards but the plate seems a bit reddish and i am getting like either either a belgian vibe or or or i mean the plate isn't yellow so it's not nether the netherlands i am thinking belgium here and if it is then it's very good belgium is a small country we'll get some points um where in belgium [Music] feels a little bit hilly maybe a little bit hilly um so maybe let's go what's the seems like a small small like small village but sign too hard to see too hard to see unfortunately i'm guessing that's like a like a street name um i'm thinking that uh belgium i'm afraid this might be denmark by any chance but i am leaning belgium uh the road the road goes like this let's pick a small village somewhere pettit haan betterhan is a very small village let's go somewhere here let's see it was denmark oh no oh no it was denmark i was afraid it would be oh no still 1800 points 1800 points is decent enough i would say let me know down in the comments how did you do in these challenges and if you would like to play more challenges with me a video will appear on the screen shortly thanks to all of the members for supporting this channel you can become a member by clicking that join button i hope you have a wonderful day be kind to one another and see in the next video [Music] ", "images_path": ["data/images_geopeter/xuZpnvD5JK1OP7uz", "data/images_geopeter/fgc2f48xT61BwPqX",

some diverse world with no moving panning and zooming uh and you can play along as well i will be publishing the challenges in the description the links so make sure you play those before watching this video okay let's start the game here is the link and let's go what do we get um oh i think we have the colombian cross hiding behind the tree i think we have the colombian cross right there we have a mountain to our south west and i think we have mountain to our northwest as well i think that's the mountain behind the cloud i mean colombia is pretty mountainous oh let's go somewhere like towards south west of colombia that area is super mountainous not bad not bad at all not bad at all 94 kilometers off i'll take it okay what is this language the the sun is to this to the north is it kind of looks like it is to the north yeah uh i mean this is europe the language is european um the sun to the north feels very weird but this this must be europe with that language i don't recognize what language exactly that is uh mountains like these uh with this language i'm thinking could this be slovenia or hmm it doesn't feel like exactly croatia maybe like the landscape feels more like croatia than slovenia somewhere around here i'm not sure but again i'm not sure about the language i don't know the languages that well let's go croatia oh what was it i was montenegro ah okay i mean yeah makes sense makes sense i mean 4k points but could be better it would be better if i recognize the language okay what do we have we have like a mountain to our north don't see the license plates but i'm getting like north american vibes here i am thinking this might be like british columbia or or something washington possibly british columbia somewhere in this area let's go southern british columbia let's see not too bad not too bad again uh 4k points i hope i'm hoping we get at least 20k uh in total in in the whole game we'll see if it happens um this should be thailand with these bollards and the yellow line in the middle thailand looking like this um very green it's very tropical um mountain killer mountain looks like we have to our south east would we be somewhere here i'm thinking somewhere around here okay not bad not bad but i'm very happy with that i guess oh and this looks like uae and the flags are also right yeah those are not jordan flags this is uae where in the uae though i mean we will have 20k points i i will reach the goal but i had had set for myself uh but still i want to get as close as possible we have like around about i don't know how how common are roundabouts in ua some countries around the have roundabouts everywhere some countries don't have many roundabouts um i'm guessing this is dubai or somewhere very near dubai although we don't see any of those high buildings maybe they are behind us if they are behind us it means they would be to our north or northeast um i don't know let's go maybe somewhere here maybe or no yes no okay let's go somewhere around here ah it was more to the more to the northeast okay fair enough but okay what what was the top score uh total score 22 a thousand points not bad i'm very happy with this um yeah how did you guys do uh leave it in the comments below let me know let's head to the next game okay another game another challenge let's go let's see how well can we do okay this one is easy we have this car right here which is uh kyrgyz car we have mountains to our south very high mountains snowy mountains so let's go to kyrgyzstan by mountain star south i mean could it be bishkek we have some mountains here in bishkek to our south i mean it could might be ash as well there are pretty big mountains to the south of osh the road is going like almost north to south maybe somewhere here i'm feeling good about this actually let's go there ah damn it oh no it was right here oh no oh no the other side of kyrgyzstan that sucks 500 kilometers away let's see where are we there now these bollards uh with these bowlers we we are either in czechia or slovakia it looks like we have gen 4 coverage which would indicate that we are in czechia because as far as i know there is no gen 4 coverage in slovakia let's have a look at mountains and the landscape doesn't look like too too hilly maybe like somewhere here maybe oh more to the north okay okay but still not too bad got the right country i'm pleased with that um okay i am thinking really cannot see that sign but i am getting like south korean vibes here with the yellow line in the middle as well this doesn't feel like a low cam for japan i am thinking south korea have some mountains to our south some plantations as well let's go i mean like all of the south kor all of south korea is pretty mountainous i think let's go usually i go with dejean when i have no idea where to guess in south korea which is most of the time i go with dejean so let's go there and pray i mean could be worse 111 kilometers away not too bad not too bad okay round four okay this one is good this one is good we see this car this google car indicates that we are in um ghana even though we don't see the tape this is gonna where in ghana might we be [Music] no signs are readable unfortunately let's go with oop why am i zooming in there uh let's go with kumasi i feel maybe possibly not sure there is a mountain to our south i'm not sure like exactly where the mountains in ghana are unfortunately they might be somewhere here maybe that's another thing i still need to learn ah okay it was there i wasn't thinking right here was not thinking there at least got the country right again that that's something to be happy about okay this is europe this is europe sound to the south gen 2 camera i am thinking ireland here i am thinking ireland if not if it's not ireland and somewhere close to ireland somewhere in that area okay let's go with ireland let's go with ireland um really nothing nothing to go by very green looking very green maybe let's go closer to to the uk border like to the to the water in case it is uk just in case is it ireland oh no it was luxembourg oh god oh no oh god uh oh no that's bad that's bad uh almost 3k points how much did we have in total we did reach 20k which was my goal so at least we reached that so there we go let's play another game okay let's go for the last game let's see how we do this time oh no this feels like generic america generic america i don't know it feels to me at least this feels like eastern america eastern america kind of north like i know vermont or maine somewhere here is it okay it wasn't vermont it was actually canada but we are very close very close less than 250 kilometers away so i'll take it for north america i feel like that's a really good score for me oh god is that i think that's israeli bollard i think this is israel the road lines also would fit with israel yellow on the sides driving on the right side i'm pretty sure this is israel we have a hill on on our uh west hill to our west where could we be again i'm not sure where there are hills in israel unfortunately i'm thinking we might be um let's go somewhere kind of north maybe oh this is good this is close wow 25 kilometers away i'll take it i will take it oh no what is this uh hard to see the bollards those kind of look like portuguese bollards kind of i'm really not sure if they are no i don't think so i think those are just the generic generic bullets with the red in the middle for a second i thought they might be portuguese i'm thinking croatia then i'm thinking croatia it's i guess it might be hungary as well with those bollards but i'm feeling more croatia vibes it looks like this might be like a beginning of the fall with these yellow leaves and croatia has quite a lot of fall coverage so let's go somewhere like in eastern croatia because we don't see too many mountains around oh no oh no this was a bad one oh no this is spain let's let's have a look at those bollards did we have yellow in the middle oh yes i guess we did oh no oh no yeah they were too small for me to see them before oh god okay let's go to the next round maybe we can we can still technically reach uh 20k so let's let's hope for the best um with this poll i am thinking romania this is like the classical romanian pole you sometimes get them in hungary as well let's go with romania we have a hill to our south um i don't know let's go somewhere here maybe now let's go here near that city okay okay not too bad i guess my first block was closer what can you do but still pretty good we need to get at least 4k on this round to reach 20k in total in the game oh god this is stressful we have yellow lines in the middle lots of palm trees uh where is the sun the sun is kinda to our north i think yeah judging by the shadows the shadows are kinda going to the south so sun is a little bit to the north um oh god i am thinking maybe colombia maybe maybe maybe a big maybe i'm really not sure big maybe if this is colombia we will be getting 4k points if this isn't colombia that sucks let's see let's go with colombia we don't see any like big hills though maybe there are hills or east can't tell behind the palm trees but i don't see any hills to our north so maybe let's go somewhere up here i don't think there are hills there i'm not sure let's see oh nice we were even more to the north we got our 4k for uh for 42 hundred points that is awesome that is awesome yeah this this third round really screwed me over uh yeah i did not couldn't see the bollards unfortunately there portugal would would have been a better guess for sure but all in all i feel we did pretty good how did you do in these challenges let me know in the comments below and let me know
